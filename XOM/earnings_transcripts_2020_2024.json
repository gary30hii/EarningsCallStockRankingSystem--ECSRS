At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in Exxon Mobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Before getting started, I hope all of you on the call, your families and your colleagues are safe in light of the continuing challenges we face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m pleased to welcome Darren Woods, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Exxon Mobil, who will be joining me for the call today. After I cover the quarterly financial and operational results, Dan will provide his perspectives on 2020 and updates on our priorities and plans for 2021 and beyond. Following those remarks, Darren and I\u2019ll be happy to address questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I\u2019ll now highlight developments since the third quarter of this year on the next slide. In the Upstream, gas realizations increased by approximately 40%, with demand and prices recovering from lows earlier in 2020, reflecting the impact of supply disruptions, colder weather and crude-linked LNG pricing. Liquids realizations were essentially flat with the third quarter with low October prices improving as the quarter progressed. While there were no economic curtailments in the quarter, government-mandated curtailments increased to approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, the Upstream business matched its best ever reliability performance for the year. We continue to progress active exploration programs in Guyana and Brazil. And in the fourth quarter, announced a hydrocarbon discovery in Suriname, which extends Exxon Mobil\u2019s resource position in South America. In the Downstream, we achieved the best-ever personnel and process safety, as well as record reliability performance for the year. Industry refining margins remained at historic lows, driving industry rationalization with four times the 10 year average level of capacity reductions announced in 2020. With continuing weak margins, we expect further industry closures. The Chemical business matched the strong operational performance of the Upstream and Downstream, also achieving best-ever annual safety and reliability performance. This excellent performance enabled us to fully capture the improving margins, driven by sustained strength in packaging and continued recovery in automotive and global product markets. Across the corporation, we exceeded the operating cost and CapEx reduction targets that we laid out in April. We decisively responded to the unprecedented market conditions in 2020. Leveraging our global projects organization, we were able to defer spend and optimize projects to preserve the long-term value of our industry-leading investment portfolio. Let\u2019s move to Slide 4 for an overview of fourth quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of fourth quarter results relative to the third quarter. Starting with third quarter 2020, the reported loss of $700 million included favorable identified items of a $100 million, driven by the non-cash inventory adjustments we noted in the third quarter. Excluding these items, the third quarter loss was $800 million. Fourth quarter results were a loss of $20.1 billion, including $20.2 billion of identified items related to impairments. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $100 million, a $900 million improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter results were $200 million lower than the third quarter due to mark-to-market impacts on unsettled derivatives. This reflects the impact of marking-to-market open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy has not closed at the end of the quarter. We expect to realize the full earnings of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Improvements in upstream, natural gas and LNG prices as well as increased liquids production in Guyana also benefited earnings. Continued strong demand for high-value chemical performance products, coupled with the strong reliability, supported chemical earnings improvement of $200 million. Finally, as a result of the growing trend of our portfolio, we removed less strategic assets from our development plans, including certain dry gas resources, notably in North America. This resulted in a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of about $19 billion. On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items. Moving to Slide 5. Improved prices and margins in the Upstream and Chemical increased earnings by $530 million. The benefit of higher Upstream liquids production in Guyana, Canada, and the U.S. also improved earnings. This was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of planned turnaround, maintenance and the exploration activity. In the Downstream and Chemical, our integrated manufacturing sites allowed us to rapidly respond to dynamic market conditions and capture significant feedstock benefits. For example, we optimized units that typically produce gasoline to increase production of high-value chemical feedstocks, critical to the manufacturing of gowns, masks and hand sanitizer. Manufacturing results in the Downstream were improved with stronger liability and investments that high-grade product yields contributing $160 million to the fourth quarter earnings. On the next slides I will cover a brief summary of the full-year results. Slide 6 is a comparison of full-year 2020 results relative to 2019. Results reflected the unprecedented loss in demand driven by the economic impact of COVID, which in turn significantly depressed Upstream and Downstream margins. In responding to pandemic-related challenges, the organization rapidly reduced costs, achieving $3 billion in structural savings out of a total reduction of $8 billion. Our manufacturing facilities contributed an additional $1 billion with better reliability and improved product yields. Moving to Upstream volumes on Slide 7. Upstream volumes decreased by an average of approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2019. Volumes were impacted by economic and government-mandated curtailments, as well as groningen production limits, which in total reduced volumes by approximately 210,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.  Excluding the impact of economic and government-mandated curtailments, entitlements, groningen production limits and divestments, volumes increased by about 110,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. This was in line with our original production plans with optimization of maintenance activity reducing the impact of economic curtailments. Moving to Slide 8. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15% and CapEx by 30%. We exceeded these reduction targets. Looking at capital spending, we established reductions of 30%, the reorganization of our Upstream and Downstream businesses a couple of years ago enabled us accelerate the efficiency capture that we expected from these changes. Cash operating expenses were down $8 billion versus 2019, including structural reductions of about $3 billion that were delivered through optimization of supply chains and logistics, work process simplification and workforce reductions. We leveraged our new global product organization and strong relationships with EPCs to adjust our capital plan, deferring spend and further optimizing projects. This allowed us to reduce quarterly spend by $2 billion in the second quarter versus the first quarter, a 25% reduction. As we continued this work through the year, we reduced capital expenditures by $10 billion or greater than 30% versus 2019 in the original plan. Importantly, we view this while improving safety, reliability, and the environmental performance of our operation. Let\u2019s turn to the next page, where you can see the impact of these reductions on our cash profile. Excluding the impact of working capital affects, fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $600 million from the third quarter. Gross debt decreased by about $1.2 billion to $67.6 billion. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion of cash, a little above our minimum operating levels. Turning to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover a few key considerations for the first quarter. In the Upstream, government mandate curtailments are expected to average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels from the fourth quarter. Production is expected to be higher in the first quarter due to seasonal gas demand. In the Downstream, we anticipate higher scheduled maintenance in terminals to be offset by additional efficiencies. In Chemical, we anticipate continued demand resilience across packaging, hygiene, and medical segments with continuing recovery in automotive and construction markets. Schedule maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter. Corporate and finance expenses are anticipated to be about $700 million. Lastly, at current crude prices in Downstream and Chemical margins, we expect cash flow from operating activities to cover the dividend and our planned CapEx, which has flexibility to adjust depending on the business environment. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning. It\u2019s good to be on the call. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m like many of you happy to close the book on 2020 and optimistic for the year ahead. As you know, the pandemic has had devastating impacts on people and businesses around the world. These effects were especially severe in our industry. And as you consumption collapsed as economies shut down, oil prices hit their lowest point in history and refining margins fell well below their 10 year lows. It was the first time in memory that we saw simultaneous lows in each of our businesses. As I discussed a year ago, our response throughout these challenging times was primarily focused on three areas, protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to support COVID response efforts, providing critical energy and products and aggressively reducing spend while preserving value to ensure we remained in the best possible position for the eventual recovery. We\u2019re pleased with how we performed on each of these. Our employees stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products from hand sanitizer, especially products for protective equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts, we kept operations running 24x7 while achieving strong safety results and exceptional reliability performance. At the same time we leveraged on the ongoing work in reorganizing our Upstream and Downstream businesses to significantly reduce costs and preserve value in an extremely challenging and uncertain market environment. We delivered on our cost reduction objectives and outperformed our revised plan, which we shared with even April. Going forward, we\u2019re continuing to work to reduce costs by leveraging synergies from aligned organizations and work processes across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. Further opportunities are being identified to reduce costs to drive cash flow and maintain our capital allocation priorities, including paying a strong dividend and maintaining a fortified balance sheet that we deleverage over time. I\u2019ll provide more detail momentarily on the successful efforts to drive greater efficiency across our businesses and further improve our cost structure. I\u2019ll also spend time discussing the significant steps we\u2019ve taking to reduce emissions intensity and absolute emissions and our work to advance lower emission technologies like our newly announced Low Carbon Solutions business. Collectively, this will help position us as an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance while helping society move to a lower carbon future. Let me start though by highlighting a few notable achievements from 2020 and what was a very difficult business environment. During a year of unprecedented challenges, our people successfully managed our global operations, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products, while achieving best ever safety and reliability performance. We reduced cash operating expenses by more than 15%, including $3 billion of structural improvements and reduced capital investments by more than 30% to $21 billion, without compromising the advantages or value of our projects. We achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals for both methane and flaring and established new plans for 2025 that are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. These plans are expected to reduce absolute Upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. Permian basin volumes exceeded our plan at 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, despite curtailments and reduced investment. This performance was driven by significant ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and technology development. We progressed Liza Phase 2 and Payara developments in Guyana and continued our exploration success with three new discoveries, increasing the recoverable resource estimate on the Stabroek Block to nearly 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. Our Chemical business set a new record for polyethylene sales, reflecting the growth and demand for performance packaging, and strong operating performance of our expanding asset fleet. We maintained our position as a global leader in carbon capture, one we\u2019ve held for more than 30 years by increasing sequester CO2 to more than 120 million tonnes. This is well over twice the next closest competitor and larger than the next five competitors combined. To put this in perspective, 122 million tonnes is equivalent to taking more than 25 million passenger vehicles off the road in a year. In 2020, we focused on managing through the impacts of an unprecedented industry environment, leveraging the strengths of our corporation to progress an industry leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities, critical to the long term success of the company. At the same time, we drove deep structural efficiencies to improve competitiveness and position ourselves amongst the industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply. Let me start with our efficiencies. You may recall that in 2019, we completed our corporate reorganizations, moving from functional companies to businesses organized along the value chains. This allowed us to reduce overhead and provided end-to-end oversight for each business, which was a critical first step in streamlining the businesses to structurally reduce cost. It also allowed us to more effectively prioritize work and focus on the highest value activities.  Consistent organizations across each sector are allowing us to consolidate like activities to fully leverage the corporation scale, further reducing costs and improving effectiveness. Our global projects organization was established in 2019 as a result of this approach. This organization has played a critical role in reoptimizing our global investment portfolio, improving the capital efficiency of each object and when necessary cost-effectively deferring work. As we came into 2020 and the pandemic, the organization changes provided the foundation for significantly reducing spend across the businesses. Expense results are shown in this chart, which is consistent with the charts Stephen showed, excluding production in taxes and energy expenses that are a function of commodity price. As you can see, 60% of the $5 billion reduction from 2019 to 2020 was structural, driven by reduced overheads and operational efficiencies. The remaining reductions were temporary, driven by lower production and activity deferrals. During last year\u2019s planning process, each organization identified opportunities to convert the short term or temporary expense reductions into permanent structural efficiencies. This year, we expect to achieve a further $1 billion of structural efficiencies. By 2023, we will achieve a total of $6 billion in structural expense reductions versus 2019. I expect even further reductions as we take advantage of additional synergies unlocked by consistently organized businesses. One final point to make on this Slide. The structural reductions we\u2019ve shown are independent to the price environment we find ourselves. And on the other hand, returning activity and increased expenses between 2020 and 2023 are in large part, a function of the price environment. In lower price environments much of that increase would be further deferred. Let me now turn to another critical area, our capital investments. Over the past several years, we have been progressing a strategy to high-grade our asset base and improve the earnings and cash generation potential of our businesses. We announced work to invest less strategic assets and have been progressing a portfolio of industry leading investments. With pandemic driven losses, we responded quickly to bring capital spending in line with market conditions and an uncertain outlook and preserve our strong dividend. As we entered 2021, our capital plan is at a historic low, significantly reduced from 2020 levels. Our capital plans through 2025 reflected three key themes, value, flexibility, and discipline. Value derived from advancing our highest return, cash flow creative projects to deliver increased earnings and cash both near and long-term. Flexibility to respond to a dynamic market. We demonstrated this in 2020 and have developed our plans with this in mind. And discipline to make adjustments to our capital program depending on market conditions, to support a strong dividend and begin to deliver. Our plans are built on a price basis consistent with third-party outlooks and advance our highest return investments. They maintain a healthy balance sheet and our strong dividend. They\u2019re robust to a wide range of price scenarios, and using last year\u2019s experience and flexibility to respond to lower price environments.  In each plan year, we have a level of short cycle unconventional spend, which can be reduced in line with market conditions. We also expect to restart projects that have been suspended across this time horizon, but if necessary, can be delayed longer, further deferring spend. We also have a level of early investments that fund long-term growth opportunities. These two can be deferred or suspended. While each of these reductions impact the value of our plan they are available as circumstances warrant. Less flexible spend can also be reduced, but at a higher cost. This capital is generally longer cycle, more firmly committed or very near completion. The next slide helps quantify our capital flexibility. On the left of this graphic, we show available cash from operations for our 2021 plan at different rent prices, assuming the lowest refining and Chemical margins experienced from 2010 to 2019. This is our source with higher crew prices generating more available cash. As you move right, you see our uses, the current dividend and our 2021 CapEx from the previous page. As you can see, the breakeven Brent price needed to pay our dividend and invest in the low end of our flexible capital is roughly $45 a barrel. The Brent price required for 16 billion, which is the low end of our guidance and closer to where I expect our actual spend to be in 2021, is $50 a barrel. With Downstream and Chemical margins at the bottom of the 10 year historical range, we can fund our highest return investments in Guyana, the Permian in the Chemical business, and begin paying down debt at Brent prices, just above $50 a barrel. If Downstream and Chemical margins were at their 10 year averages, Brent breakeven prices would be roughly $5 a barrel lower, which would allow us to fund investments, pay the dividend and pay down debt at Brent prices above $45 a barrel. As we look at the market year-to-date actual prices in margins in total are above our plan, allowing us to progress our investments, pay the dividend and begin paying down debt in the first quarter. Obviously we\u2019re very early into the year and we know the market will change. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on developments and we\u2019ll adjust our capital spend accordingly, protecting the strong dividend and preserving the balance sheet. Let\u2019s shift to a later year in our plan, 2025. By 2025, we expect Downstream and Chemical margins to be off their lows and closer to a long-term average. In this case, we used the average margins for 2010 to 2019. In addition, we will see the full benefits of the structural OpEx improvements and additional cash from the projects that come online by 2025. As you can see there is substantially more flexibility in our capital spend. As a result, our plans continue to cover the dividend and capital investments at Brent prices as low as $35 a barrel. At Brent prices above $50 a barrel, our capital allocation framework supports our planned investments, further debt reduction and/or shareholder distributions. So as you can see, our plans were robust to a wide range of price environments, and while we are optimistic that the recent improvements in the macro environment will continue, we recognize that much could change over the next four to five years. If we face a year where Brent prices remained below $50 a barrel on a sustained basis, we would reduce investments to levels more consistent with this year\u2019s plan. Recognizing the market uncertainty we\u2019ve attempted to strike the right balance between maintaining a strong dividend, fortifying the balance sheet to delever and continuing to invest in high return cash accretive projects. This last point is critical, particularly in a depletion business. The next chart gives a good perspective of this. Our investment strategy is focused on growing earnings and cash flow across a wide range of market environments. We are investing in advantage projects with some of the industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply. They grow earnings and cash flow in a variety of market environments. This graphic helps to illustrate this. Using IHS crude price and third-party margins, we expect the cash flow from project startups over our investment horizon to represent roughly 40% of our operating cash flow in 2025. This makes a critical point. You pay a significant long-term cost for excessive short term investment reductions.  And industry, does it collectively, the market pays with much higher commodity prices, striking the right balance, responding to short-term constraints with an eye on the mid to long-term generates the greatest value. Of course, in an investment portfolio of industry advantage projects is critical. The next slide provides a perspective of the investments we are making in developing Upstream resources, which represents the majority of our Upstream capital spend. This chart graphs cumulative Upstream capital spend to develop resources from 2021 through 2025 against the Brent price required for the investment to generate a 10% return, which we\u2019ve deemed our cost of supply. As you can see, our focus on high return, lowest cost of supply investments, generate a portfolio with a cost of supply well below $3 a barrel. In fact, almost 90% of our investments in developing Upstream resources have they cost the supply of $35 per barrel or less. These investments generate an average return using third party price outlooks in excess of 30%. So as you can see, striking right balance, progressing a very attractive portfolio of investments or maintaining our strong dividend in fortifying the balance sheet to delever is essential to maximizing value, both near term and long-term. When executed in period where others are pulling back and construction markets or slack, these investments become even more attractive. When you factor in the flexibility of our short cycle investments in the Permian where the value proposition continues to grow, we are well positioned. We have an attractive investment portfolio that we can flex with market conditions to strike the right balance across our capital allocation priorities. Let me now take a few minutes to highlight the progress we\u2019ve been making in the Permian. Despite challenging conditions and a rapid change in activity, our progress in the Permian exceeded our plan and its expectations. These improvements reflect the hard work of our people. The organizational changes made in 2019 and the continued evolution of our technology and techniques. In 2019, we better integrated the experience of our global drilling, technology and project organizations with the unconventional operating organization. Working together, they made a step change in performance that continues to improve. 2020 drilling rates were 50% better than our planned and more than 20% better than full year 2019 results. Drilling and completion costs were 15% below our plan and more than 25% lower than 2019 results. We estimate that roughly two thirds of the savings were due to improve performance. As an example, the number of frac stages achieved in a day increased by 30% versus 2019. As we enter 2021, we continue to see progress in our key performance metrics, further growing the value of this resource and improving upon our plans. In 2020, capital expenditures in the Permian were 35% below plan. Despite significant economic curtailments in the second quarter, 2020 volumes of 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day exceeded our plan, about 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, above 2019. Going forward, with the pandemic related impacts on our balance sheet and market outlook, we are pacing Permian investments to maintain positive free cash flow, delever industry leading capital efficiency and achieve double digit returns at less than $35 a barrel. Based on the current market price projections our plans results in Permian volumes of approximately 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by 2025. If demand and prices are lower than current third-party outlooks, we\u2019ll adjust our plans. At a nominal Brent price of $50 a barrel through 2025, we would expect to deliver an additional a 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2025 versus 2020 production levels. Key point here is that we have flexibility in options, which I expect to improve with time. We\u2019ve been making significant progress in our technology programs, which are contributing to current performance. With the advances we are making, I expect continued improvements in productivity, growing volumes at even lower cost. Hopefully, the Permian discussion and broader overview of our investment plans provided a useful perspective on the opportunities we have and the balance we are attempting to strike across our capital allocation priorities, amid an uncertain market outlook. I\u2019d like to move on to the results we\u2019ve achieved in lowering our emissions and the plans we have for further reductions, but before I do, I\u2019d like to recap some key points. Our portfolio offers the best collection of investment opportunities we\u2019ve had in over 20 years. We have some of industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply projects with strong returns that are robust to low prices. Coupled with our expense efficiencies, our capital program through 2025 improves the earnings power and cash generation potential of our asset base in both the near and long-term. Leveraging our experience for 2020, we\u2019ve built flexible plans that will allow us to adjust to market developments and potentially lower prices. If prices move higher than our plan basis, this will allow us to more quickly replenish our balance sheet. Our plans strike the right balance, growing value, maintaining strong dividend and a fortified balance sheet that is delevered over time. Let\u2019s turn to our work and position the company for a lower carbon energy future. Addressing the risk of climate change is one of society\u2019s biggest challenges, requiring the combined effort and collaboration of governments, academia, businesses and consumers. ExxonMobil has spent decades researching new technologies and deploying existing ones to lower our emissions and the emissions of our customers. Today, we remain committed to this. We plan to position ExxonMobil as a leader in our industry. Since its inception, we have supported the goals of the Paris Agreement, engaging in climate-related policies and supporting a tax on carbon. Since 2016, the year of the Paris Agreement, we\u2019ve reduced our operating greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Last year, we met the reduction objectives we set in 2018. And in the fourth quarter announced new emission reduction plans for 2025 that are consistent with the goals of Paris. Our plan to reduce emissions from operated assets and align the company with the World Bank\u2019s initiative to eliminate routine flaring. To reduce the intensity of our operating upstream greenhouse gas emissions, we drive a decrease in methane intensity and a decrease in flaring intensity. This is expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% and absolute methane and flaring emissions by 40% to 50% versus 2016 levels. Our plans continue to invest in lower emissions initiatives, with an expect to spend up more than $500 million a year. This includes energy efficiency, TCS investments, cogeneration, research and development and renewable purchases, an area where we already make a significant contribution. Today, we are the second largest buyer of wind and solar power in the oil and gas industry and among the top 5% across all corporations, purchasing roughly 600 megawatts. While we don\u2019t bring a significant competitive advantage to many wind and solar projects, we can leverage our size to support world scale developments with purchase contracts hoping to ensure they are built. We\u2019re also the world\u2019s leader in carbon capture, responsible for over 40% of the CO2 capture. To put this into context, the nature conservatory announced a campaign in 2008 to plant a 1 billion trees. Our cumulative CO2 capture is more than double that goal. We\u2019re also one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydrogen. As the potential for this and the energy transition develops, we are well-positioned to leverage our experience, scale and technology to contribute. In fact, to ensure that we effectively leverage all of our technologies, experiences and expertise, yesterday we announced the formation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This business will focus on advancing commercial CCS opportunities and deploying emerging technologies as they mature. I\u2019ll come back to our plans for this in a moment as we expect it to underpin our long-term strategy in driving emission reductions. I want to first focus on the progress we\u2019ve already made. As you can see in this chart, since the inception of the Paris Agreement, ExxonMobil has made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, down 6% significantly outpacing the progress made by society as a whole. Over the past 20 years, we have invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower emissions energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations. During that time, we eliminated or avoided about 480 million tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 100 million cars. The plans we announced in December further reduce the intensity of our businesses, delivering an expected reduction in emissions of roughly 12% by 2025. I want to pause here for a minute and emphasize that these are not targets. These reductions are built into our base plans. In conjunction with the reorganizations completed in 2019, we established a more rigorous process to capture emission reduction efforts at operating units around the world. Plans developed in 2020 leverage this process and built in additional efficiency steps and accretive investments to deliver these reductions. Like other plan objectives, the performance of our businesses and our senior management will be evaluated based on achieving these commitments. I think it\u2019s important to point out that our plans are in line with the stated ambitions of the Paris Agreement, which you can see on the next chart. This slide overlays both global and ExxonMobil emissions since 2016 with the goals of the Paris Agreement, hypothetical 1.5 degree and two degree Celsius pathways. As you can see, our plans are consistent with the stated ambitions. Of course, the challenge will be maintaining our progress into the future for both ExxonMobil and society at large. Today, the set of solutions available in overcoming this challenge is incomplete. There is a gap between what is needed and what is available. This is illustrated by the 2016 Paris submissions shown by the green diamond, which is an estimate of the signatories nationally determined contributions. We are working to close this gap and help provide solutions for society. Our investment in R&D is focused on the world\u2019s highest emitting sectors, manufacturing, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for 80% of global energy related carbon emissions and where today\u2019s alternatives are insufficient. As I said earlier, through 2025, we expect to invest more than $3 billion in lower emissions initiatives, which include energy efficient process technology, advanced biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, which is a crucial technology for achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Carbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in addressing emissions from difficult to decarbonize sectors. This is also generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions. And the two degree scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is estimated that in 2040, 10% of total energy will require CCS. It\u2019s also estimated that 15% of global emissions will be mitigated by CCS. If carbon capture and storage does not progress and play a significant role in decarbonizing the economy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the society\u2019s cost of achieving a two degree outcome would more than double, increasing the cost by 138%. In short, the world is unlikely to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement without focused action and the innovation in carbon capture and storage. Unfortunately, according to the IEA, its development and deployment are not on track. This is an area where we can potentially leverage unique capabilities to make a difference. ExxonMobil has been the global leader in carbon capture for more than 30 years. We believe there is an opportunity to leverage our deep operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution skills, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology to uniquely contribute in this area. In 2018, we formed a carbon capture venture to identify and develop potential CCS opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies. This group has been working with governments, industry, academia and tech companies to advanced projects. Today, we have more than 20 opportunities under evaluation. With increasing government focus, growing market demand and additional investor interest, we are increasing our emphasis in this area through the establishment of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This new business will continue to progress the ongoing venture work, while looking to expand other commercial opportunities from our extensive low carbon technology portfolio. The business will focus its efforts on solutions critical to achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, work with governments around the world to promote the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and partner with interested parties to achieve improvements at scale.  While new, this business will hit the ground running, incorporating the existing venture organization and a healthy pipeline of potential opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information as this effort advances. Before we open the lines for your questions, let me close by reiterating our areas of focus. Delivering world class safety and reliability, driving structural cost reductions, advancing a flexible portfolio of high return, cost advantage investments, maintaining the strong dividend and fortified balance sheet and reducing emissions while developing needed technologies to support the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Our people delivered in these areas last year, despite the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. I\u2019m absolutely confident they will deliver even more this year and into the future. I hope I\u2019ve given you a deeper understanding of our strategy and plans for 2021 and beyond. I look forward to providing you with more detail during our March Investor Day and as the year progresses. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you for your comments, Darren. We will now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Woods and Mr. Littleton. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody.\nStephen Littleton: Good morning, Doug.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Darren, Exxon Mobil\u2019s equity has outperformed S&P Energy and S&P 500 too since the new capital management plan was announced in November. And as you guys have posted further progress on restructuring exploration and environmental plans too, we did have some industry help along the way. But on this point, it seems like you\u2019re pretty encouraged about the outperformance that you\u2019ve seen on the structural efficiency component that you talked about earlier today. And that divestitures, which are another part of the capital management program probably recover, but in a better price environment. So, my question is whether or not you agree with my characterizations of these two items and also whether or not you have any additional color or specifics on these parts of the capital management program, which make you optimistic about performance in those areas?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Thanks for the question. And before I answer that let me just take a minute to congratulate you on your pending retirement, well-earned...\nDoug Terreson: Well, thank you.\nDarren Woods: I miss having you in the mix.\nDoug Terreson: Well, thank you.\nDarren Woods: With respect to your comment and the delivery of some of the improvements we\u2019ve made, I just maybe step back and provide a little perspective on the journey we\u2019ve been on, as we looked at the business and focused on the opportunities to improve performance over time, we recognize the need as a capital-intensive industry to make sure that we had a very healthy and attractive set of capital investment opportunities, which is what we focused on at the beginning to recognize the size of that opportunity and the leverage that it gives us with respect to earnings and cash flow. And so, as you heard, early on with my tenure that\u2019s what I was focused. We generated a very, very attractive set of investments. At the same time, we were progressing an organizational restructuring, the move from this functional organization that we had put in place at the time of the merger of Exxon Mobile, which served its purposes and added a lot of value at the time as we brought those two companies together. But with time, recognize the need to move to an organization that had a better line of sight end-to-end on the business and a more direct accountability for profit and loss. And we completed that transition in 2019. And I think, last year in the March analyst meeting, I mentioned that we were focused on taking advantage of the new organization to drive efficiencies. And I would say 2020 delivered on that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see more opportunity down the road and have actually built into our plans for 2020 these improved efficiencies. And so that\u2019s what I would tell you is the foundation of the plans that we\u2019ve got and the improvement opportunities that we see going forward independent of where the market takes us. Then on top of that, obviously, and as we said back in our third quarter call with where the impact of the pandemic and the price response to the loss of economic activity, we recognize that that had to be a temporary downturn, just because of the fundamentals associated with the industry and wanted to make sure that we prepared ourselves for what would be an eventual recovery recognizing the timing of that is somewhat uncertain. And I would say, as we sit here today, I\u2019d still characterize as somewhat uncertain, although encouraging here over the last several months. But we haven\u2019t -- we\u2019re not kind of taking that to the bank, so to speak, we\u2019re prepared and keeping an eye on how the market develops and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. So, I feel good about where we\u2019re at today. I think we\u2019ve got our company in a position and our organization, focused on the right things. And then we\u2019ve got an opportunity set with flexibility that we can execute as we go forward. And as I said, as I look at the first quarter where we\u2019re ahead of where we thought we were going to be and we\u2019ll already start to delever and continue to progress our investment. So, I feel as good as you can given some of the uncertainty out there with the residual pandemic effects.\nDoug Terreson: Yes. And then, Darren, you guys made the most asset-rich company in our sector. And last year was kind of an impossible year to even think about selling assets probably. But you have a lot to work with. And so spend a minute on that too on divestitures and progressing that plan?\nDarren Woods: Right. I think, as you saw last year when we\u2019ve been talking about, we\u2019re really trying to focus the activity on the highest value, highest return, lowest cost of capital at which has meant prioritizing investments and high-grading the portfolio. So, we announced a divestment program, something that we hadn\u2019t historically not done and have been out prosecuting that divestment program.\nDoug Terreson: Okay.\nDarren Woods: We\u2019ve got assets in the market today. But as we said at the time we announced it and continues to be the underlying principle associated with a divestment program is -- it\u2019s a value-driven program. So, we\u2019re looking to make sure that we can find a buyer that values the assets, cease more opportunity than we can prosecute with the asset. And so that is what drives the decision.  Obviously, last year with all the uncertainty, wasn\u2019t a whole lot of activity in this space, although we did make some progress. We have mechanisms with respect to the deals that can accommodate some of the price uncertainty, and that\u2019s going to continue on -- I would say as the market recovers and people\u2019s views develop more fully, I expect we\u2019ll have additional advancements in that program.\nDoug Terreson: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Doug. Best of luck.\nOperator: We will go next two Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, guys, and thank you for the incremental disclosure. Lots of interesting stuff to unpack. I guess, the first question is I just wanted to confirm, did you say you expect to be on the low end of the $16 billion to $19 billion band this year? And then the follow-up around that is you\u2019re at $67.6 billion of gross debt. Is there an absolute level that you guys are gunning for here when it comes for -- comes to your gross debt level? \nDarren Woods: Good morning, Neil. Yes. I will confirm my -- that was the comment I made. I do expect to be on the lower end of that range. And then, our plan with respect to debt -- we talked about in the third quarter, we kind of set a hard limit of around $70 billion. We didn\u2019t want to go above that and working hard to bring that down, expect for that to come down in the first quarter. And we\u2019ll continue to work to bring that down to really rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. There\u2019s one of the three capital allocation priorities, and we think absolutely critical to underpin the business we\u2019ve got going forward and to ride through the cycles that we face. And clearly, 2020 was a very deep down cycle, one that frankly, we\u2019ve never seen before. And I\u2019m pleased that the capital structure we had in place and our ability to respond to that unprecedented marketing environment that was very successful. We leveraged the use of the balance sheet, obviously, and we\u2019re now going to rebuild that to have the capacity we need to continue to weather the ups and downs of the cycles that we know will happen as we go forward.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Darren. And the follow-up is just your perspective on M&A, we -- yes, last year was as the busy one in terms of incremental E&P deal. Just how does Exxon think about the M&A landscape, the bid/ask right now? And certainly, the super major cycle that we saw in the late 1990s, early 2000s created a lot of value. There was some press speculation on that, and I\u2019m not sure what you can say, but conceptually, do you see the potential for major on major consolidation? Or is that too difficult to execute, given all the challenges of consummating that type of deal?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure, Neil. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to comment on speculation in the press. But what I would say is the approach that we take in this space has been pretty consistent. And we\u2019ve talked about that over the years. And it\u2019s really looking for value opportunities where there\u2019s another company that we can leverage synergies, leverage a different port -- differences in portfolios that basically have compliment one another. We look at a lot of things and that whole space we\u2019ve been active in that for quite some time. We continue to be active to look for opportunities to grow value, unique value. And that\u2019s kind of what drives in our mind the opportunity. And, as you know, we talked about that past, having always found opportunities that we felt were valued correctly or valued in line with what would be required to kind of extract unique value through an acquisition or a merger. But we continue to look in that space and it will be an active program going forward.\nStephen Littleton: And if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d probably add. The other thing that we look at and is the fact that it has to compete against our existing portfolio projects, which is industry leading best. So, when we look at any type of potential acquisition, we look compare it relative to some of our other investment opportunities notably an Upstream and Chemical space. Thank you, Doug. \nDarren Woods: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: We will next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and happy New Year. I wonder if I could start off asking you to address the 800 pound gorilla driven [ph], which is obviously the criticism of the level that you and the management team by activists. I want to ask specifically to, how Exxon is responding, it seems to us disclosure, for example, in carbon capture and emissions reductions and your demonstrable capital flexibility are all something that perhaps has been overlooked in the past. I wonder if you could speak to how you\u2019re looking to address that and I\u2019ll go to follow up, please.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Well, good morning, Doug and happy New Year to you as well. What I\u2019d say is, last year clearly was unprecedented event something that forced some dramatic action in the industry as a whole and our company. And as we leverage the new organization and reconfigured our plans in response to the pandemic and the consequences of that, we changed a lot of things and operating under a new set of constraints, obviously drawing down our balance sheet to the point that we did required a different approach going forward. And so that was the focus and rebuilding the plans for 2020. And as I\u2019ve said I think the organization as a whole responded very, very well to the challenging conditions, not only in operating our businesses in the environment, but at the same time, putting together very thorough well thought out plans for how we would go forward and accommodate the increased uncertainty and the recovery that we knew we had to make coming out of the pandemic. And frankly, If we put those plans together, we recognize that was a change from the past and our past plans and wanting to make sure that we effectively communicated that going forward. So, we had a very early release at the back end of the year after the Board approved the plans that provided some perspective with the intent of coming into this call and more thoroughly taking the community -- investment community through more details of that plan. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing here. All the things we\u2019ve talked about, as you can clearly tell, if you look at the materiality of it and its work that\u2019s been underway for quite some time. I\u2019d say 2020 a lot of effort by the organization to put those together. And our intent is to make sure that we keep the outside community kind of up-to-date with those plans given the constraints that we\u2019re operating under.\nDoug Leggate: I realize it\u2019s not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate the clarity. But let me just pick up on one issue as my follow-up, and it\u2019s on cost flexibility and the dividend. Because it seems you\u2019re -- I don\u2019t want to say unequivocal, but you\u2019re certainly providing a great deal of emphasis on the sustainability of the dividend. So, I wonder if you could just speak to that. I think you answered, maybe talk to the inflection in non-productive capital, because you have spent ton of money on things that it seems to just about to get to that inflection, which can support that perception of dividend surety. So, I wonder if you could just address those issues now we get there. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes. I think -- so, we\u2019ve built the plan based on the three capital allocation priorities I touched on as part of my prepared remarks and try to optimize the value to the corporation, recognizing that if you look at the portfolio and the underlying strategy that we embarked on back in 2017/2018 timeframe, that remains in place. The even stress testing the projects and the investment opportunities we\u2019ve had we have in the portfolio continue to look attractive in this environment. You saw the Upstream portfolio, which is the biggest part of our spend show that. So, our intent then is to kind of pace that investment as we move forward, reflective of the market environment. And we\u2019ve structured the capital program, again, consistent with the experience that we had last year and the drawdown that we had in capital to make sure that we have flexibility to adjust. If you think about what we\u2019ve put in that flexible bucket, there is a large chunk of or a piece of short-term -- the short cycle investments in the Permian where we clearly have flexibility. We\u2019ve got pace projects, so things that are Global Projects organization as we were working to reoptimize the capital program, I think very cost-effectively and working with our EPC partners suspended some of that projects, but put them in warm standby so that we can start those back-up again. That\u2019s in our flexible spending. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got some longer term spend to fill the pipeline early on so that we\u2019ve got things as we move outside the plan period. So, all those things are -- and if we can make decisions in real-time about whether we continue to progress those or pull back in that area depending on what the environments at. And because we can do that and as we\u2019ve pointed out in these charts that we\u2019ve shown, we\u2019ve got lots of flexibility under different price environments to sustain the dividend. So, we feel really good about where we\u2019re at today that we\u2019ve got good upside with respect to growing the cash flow, as I\u2019ve showed. But at the same time, if we need to and the environment dictates, we can pull back. I think that\u2019s the optimal position as to develop options, to have the flexibility to adjust if you need to. We\u2019re very keen not to pull things back to a point where we didn\u2019t have plans to take advantage of the portfolio that we had if the market environment was better than what many were thinking of last year. So, our intent was build plans that are as best as possible what the market expects and then be positioned to pull down if necessary. Going in with no plan trying to ramp up is a lot harder than going in with a plan and coming down.\nDoug Leggate: I think your flexibility is underappreciated by a lot of people. Thanks so much, Darren. I appreciate the answers.\nDarren Woods: Great. Thank you, Doug.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning, Darren.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: So, first question and perhaps it\u2019s a signal of the times. But the charts around your flexibility only take the oil price up to $55 at this point, which is notable considering we\u2019re at $58 now. So, I\u2019m curious, is this message today, one, where we\u2019re supposed to be taking it as an official cap on the capital spending long-term in the $20 billion to $25 billion range, such that any additional cash flow in an upside case would be fully committed to debt reduction? You did mention shareholder distributions in one of those slides as well. So, just any incremental thoughts there.\nDarren Woods: Sure, Phil. I\u2019d kind of come back to we don\u2019t know where prices are going to go. And I think we have not tried build plans based on speculating where prices will go. Instead what we\u2019ve tried to do is build plans based on what a reasonable assumption is. And when I say reasonable, we test our price bases against kind of third-party and where the market -- generally the market is. And our expectation is to be kind of within and certainly on the lower end of the price expectations and that\u2019s how we build the plans. We recognized when we put that together that those prices probably aren\u2019t going to materialize and could be higher or lower and so they\u2019ll have flexibility in. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into how high we went on that chart. I mean it\u2019s kind of just a -- it was a number that we pick. The higher it goes, the better off obviously we\u2019re at. And I would tell you our first priority above and beyond the plan if we see a price environment that\u2019s higher than we have anticipated, it would be to continue to delever and to rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. Because again I would tell you -- and as I\u2019ve talked about today and in the past, balancing across the three capital allocation priorities is absolutely critical and you take different decisions in the short-term. Last year when we recognized we were in a very deep downturn, one that we also believe would be temporary, prioritized the dividend and made sure that we continue to pay that and grew on the balance sheet. As we come out of that, which is what we expected, our plan is to rebuild the balance sheet so that we can be in a position going forward to absorb what other shocks come in the future. And at the same time, we wanted to make sure that we are continuing to invest in these accretive projects, because ultimately they are going to underpin the long-term success of the corporation. So, I\u2019d say the key word as we work through the last year is balance. And I\u2019d say the other one is optionality, flexibility. And that\u2019s what the plan now reflects and what we\u2019ve talked about today.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Got it. My follow-up question would be around Slide 30 and your commentary about how the first quarter is shaping up. Obviously, on this slide the only area where the margins are well below the low end of the range is on Downstream. And based on your long history in that business and how you\u2019re seeing things today specifically for Downstream, would you say that the margins right now are consistent with low end of the range and kind of the $3 billion annualized uplift that you\u2019re talking about? I recognize you made a comment that in totality you are there, but I\u2019m specifically thinking more about the Downstream? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes. What you see on the Downstream in that chart 30, we\u2019ve put a kind of a January estimate and there is some kind of where we are at currently, and it\u2019s still well outside that historic range. So, I think today if you look at the industry as a whole across the globe where margins are at, it\u2019s not a sustainable position just because of the losses that are accruing. And if you look back in history, I think, there is a certain physics associated with these businesses that say, it can only go so low before you\u2019re not covering your cost and you\u2019re bleeding cash, so you\u2019re going to have to make adjustments. And that historical range, in my mind, kind of sets those limits. I mean, these are commodity businesses. And if you take a price that goes below the marginal cost of supply, it\u2019s going to end up costing industry as a whole and eventually players will rationalize and drop out. And that -- for as long as I\u2019ve been in the Downstream, that business has been long supply and it\u2019s a slow process to rationalize it tight, particularly as more refineries come on out in Asia. So, I think what you\u2019re seeing there is the time cycle associated with rebalancing the markets and the supply demand balance. Obviously, demand is off pretty significantly what was already kind of marginally long business. So, it\u2019ll be a function of demand coming back and how quickly that recovers and then continued rationalization. As Stephen said, we\u2019ve seen last year much higher levels of rationalization and my expectation would be if we don\u2019t see the margins recover backed within that band, you\u2019ll continue to see that.\nPhil Gresh: Got it. And do you think we\u2019ll get there in 2021 towards the low end at some point?\nDarren Woods: I think it\u2019s very dependent upon how the recovery goes, how the economies pick back up again. I think it\u2019s -- there is a mix view and we\u2019ve tried to be pretty conservative in our planning just recognizing the mechanisms required to rebalance the market that\u2019s going to take time. My expectation is the second half of the year will look a lot better than the first half. But exactly where we end up on that bar, I think it\u2019s tough to tell. I think, eventually, we will get back there. If not, back into this year, sometime into next year and potentially see an overcorrection, so to speak, as demand continues to pick up and with the reduced supply, we\u2019ll see that tightness in the supply demand marketplace self out in the Downstream is what I would expect. The challenge with all these things -- I\u2019m talking about very fundamental things. It\u2019s not a question of if that\u2019s going to happen, but when. And I think that\u2019s -- I think the trick in this game and our view is you should recognize it\u2019s coming, but not build the plan based on the hope that it does.\nPhil Gresh: Great. Thanks, Darren. Look forward to more updates in March.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: The next to Jon Rigby with UBS.\nJon Rigby: Thank you. Thank you Darren for taking the questions. The first one is on the announcement around CCS. I mean, it seems to me is that you\u2019ve taken your time the step into it is a considered one. And I guess it must be based at least with a view that the prospect of the business there. And so, my question was, what do you think has to happen or are you able to describe some of the steps that have to happen, both technologically and regulatorily fiscally to get us from where we are now to something that looks like a genuine business opportunity? And the second question, if I ask a follow-up as well at the same time. Just on CapEx, is it fair to characterize the level of CapEx that you need to address one of those three objectives that you had, which is to sustain the dividend over the very long term, but CapEx needs to be in that 2021 to 2025 and the current level of spend that you\u2019re projecting for 2021 is more around about protecting the balance sheet and therefore not a sustainable level of CapEx in the long-term consistent with your payout? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure, Jon. So, on the CCS, I think -- and as I indicated and as I\u2019ve talked, I think for as long as I\u2019ve been publicly speaking about this is, we\u2019ve recognized that carbon capture and storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of Paris Agreement. And one of the things that we\u2019ve noticed over time is -- and I think the IEA described it as momentum in this space is that we\u2019re beginning to see a broader recognition of the importance of that technology. I think the industry for a long time is recognized, but I think more broadly it\u2019s being recognized as an important part of the solutions set in terms of achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. So, we\u2019ve been working for quite some time on the technology and trying to address the cost side of that to find a technology that was lower in cost, which would then make the opportunities more attractive and accelerate the deployment of CCS. And so, a lot of work over the years on the -- what I\u2019d say is the fundamental process technology in the way that can actually concentrate CO2. And as we look at that portfolio, we\u2019ve been advancing. There is more work to be done there for sure, still technology developments that we\u2019ve got to progress. But we\u2019re now seeing, I think, with the increased recognition of the need for this technology, governments being more amenable to and understanding and recognizing the need for policy frameworks and regulatory frameworks, legal frameworks to support establishing CCS. We\u2019re seeing investor demand, where people are interested in investing those types of projects. So, I think there is money that\u2019s looking for opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. And then there is a market growing for reduction credits. We see a lot of things, a lot of market developments and momentum in the market as a whole, which all contribute to building a sustainable business. And so, we felt like, given where things we want to, now is the time to bring a more concerted effort in this space and start making sure that we\u2019re staffed and we\u2019ve got people working hard, engaging with governments to help move all those things along. If you look at that portfolio of products that we\u2019ve got today, one of the biggest challenges is in the policy and regulatory framework space. And so, that\u2019s a real focus area. And I think certainly here in the U.S. we\u2019ve got an administration that\u2019s interested in progressing in this space and we\u2019re there and are ready to talk with them and help provide some perspective from an industry standpoint. We think the timing is right and we think we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve put the right people in this new organization to kind of move that forward. But it will be I think this is a complex area. There are a lot of variables at play that we\u2019ve got to bring together and we need to make sure that we got our senior management focused on bringing those things together. On your CapEx, 2021 CapEx, you\u2019re right, that is the low CapEx number for us. In fact, if you look at the history and going back in time since Exxon and Mobil merged, it\u2019s the lowest level of capital spend that we\u2019ve had in any year. And so, I think it\u2019s fair to say, just using history as a guide that that\u2019s probably not a sustainable level of CapEx. And it is a response to the environment that we found ourselves in and the recovery that we\u2019re making coming out of that environment. And I think longer term going forward, which is one of the reasons why our 2022 through 2025 range in guidance is higher. It\u2019s just a recognition that in a more steady state environment, the spend needs to be higher to support kind of the growth and to underpin the capital allocation priorities we have.\nJon Rigby: Makes sense. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet Jonathon.\nOperator: Over next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Thank you for following on me.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: I did want to dig into commercialization of carbon capture a little bit, because there is a few paths you could just sell carbon credits where applicable, but it also integrates with the rest of the business in an interesting way, particularly gas in terms of customer overlap and bundling opportunities. I know it\u2019s early days. But can you just talk about that as something that\u2019s kind of leading the way in this commercialization effort? How it overlaps with the existing business? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure. I think the point you make, Sam, is the one maybe I was trying to hit on with Jonathon is, this market demand in terms of people looking for cleaner options and offsets and emission reduction steps. And so, we think there\u2019s an opportunity there with that with many of our -- the products in our portfolio. And we see that across, frankly, all of our sectors, the Downstream, you mentioned gas, we certainly see that there in gas and we see opportunities from -- in terms of our recycling or environmentally improved footprint in the Chemical business as well. So, I think, that -- as I mentioned, the momentum that we\u2019re seeing broadly in this space is opening up market opportunities, which we think this business can take -- get engaged with and make sure that we are contributing where we can. I mentioned, these -- to make a difference and move the needle, there needs to be fairly broad investment over time and we have a lot of capabilities that lend itself to that. Not only do we have the technology work that we\u2019ve been doing, we\u2019ve got a projects organization that knows how to scale up technologies and apply. Then we have a manufacturing footprint that we can take advantage of. We\u2019ve got a very good understanding of subsurface and how that works. We\u2019ve got midstreams in pipeline. So, we -- if you look at the different elements that have to go into successfully building a CCS business is very consistent with what we do today and very much in our wheelhouse. So, we see that as an opportunity. And frankly, the challenge has been the development of the market and the needs here. And again as we see the momentum in that grow, we see that opportunity. So I think that\u2019s the work and what we're focused on doing here.\nSam Margolin: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up in terms of scale and the addressable market here, your slide on carbon capture as a percentage of the total carbon offset targets around 15%. Let\u2019s say, Exxon in your 2019 Sustainability Report, you have about 120 million tons of Scope 1 and 2. Emissions -- is the 15% number of that kind of a reasonable scope, call it, like 18 million tons potentially of scalability here, is that kind of the way you're thinking about it?\nDarren Woods: Well, I would tell you, in part forming this -- moving from venture to a full blown business is the -- one of the advantages within the company is that brings that business into our plan process where we can put together marketing and business plans, put together annual plans and lay all that opportunity. And I would tell you, Sam, this is the year that we will do that with this business. We\u2019ll give Joe a chance to get in the chair and then get his organization focused on marketing and business plan and then translating that into our company plan process and then at the end of the year we\u2019ll have -- we\u2019ll start to kind of track that like we do all the other businesses. And so, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a question that we\u2019ll answer as we go forward and look at these opportunities, made a big variable in all of this is just, there is a lot of things that have to come together to make these things move and progress. And so, part of it is a function of how that external market moves, part of it\u2019s a function of how quickly the governments respond and put in the right kind of regulatory and policy frameworks. And so, I think it\u2019s a complicated space, but it\u2019s one that a very consistent with what we've historically done. And so, I feel pretty optimistic that we can come in and contribute and actually help in this space, and it\u2019s very consistent with our competencies and capabilities. And so, this is the space that we feel like where we can contribute and help society reduce their emissions. So -- but I would say stay tuned, there is a lot of work that has to happen here. And as we develop that, we\u2019ll be sharing with you how we see that the potential here and how these opportunities are developing.\nSam Margolin: Thank you so much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Sam.\nStephen Littleton: Operator, I think we probably have time for one more caller.\nOperator: Yes. It looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question will be from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. Appreciate it.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Devin.\nDevin McDermott: So, I wanted to maybe first follow-up on the line of questioning here on the low carbon business. And the last few questions are on the carbon capture side, but you mentioned some other opportunities in hydrogen and biofuels. And I was wondering if you just elaborate on the types of projects and technologies that you\u2019re focused on advancing there. And then as part of that, if you think about this low carbon spending that you\u2019ve planned in the next few years, are there pockets of opportunities across these businesses that are starting to compete for capital with the legacy Upstream, Chemicals and Downstream spending that you have in the capital program, and where are those biggest opportunities looks tangible in the near-term for scale and capital?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would say -- so we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve had a very active technology portfolio across this whole space. You may recall in the past, I\u2019ve talked about our energy centers, we\u2019ve got around the world where we\u2019ve partnered with universities, very focused on investing in areas where we see the potential for alternatives. Biofuels is an area where we\u2019ve got a number of different technology drives to for -- to see if we can develop more cost effective biofuels that work at scale. A lot of work in process technology and how we take existing processes and make them more energy efficient, less emissions associated with them. So, trying to leverage some of the new materials that are out there. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve got a really broad spectrum of opportunities we\u2019ve been working on. We\u2019ve got relationships with 80 universities where we\u2019re not necessarily steering that technology work, but we are participating in it. And as we see those technologies advance and look -- and get higher potential -- have a higher potential of those things, we would look to try to bring into the portfolio. So, we got -- what I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve cast a pretty wide net around the technology space, recognizing that it\u2019s requiring some level of evolution, if not, breakthroughs in technologies for them to be successful. And so, since you can\u2019t really plan for that we kind of keep our finger on the pulse of a lot of different technologies with the intent then to -- as they look more promising, but it bring them into the emerging and then commercial technology space. And so, that\u2019s the work that this new group will be focused on. And again, we\u2019ll complement what we\u2019re doing in the carbon capture and storage. We\u2019ve got the biofuels work that we\u2019ve been doing, and we\u2019ve got the process technology work that we\u2019ve been doing and a lot of those things overlap with one and other. Certainly -- and, of course, that then also has hydrogen and the process technology work we\u2019re doing and the CCS work together have a lot of overlap with potential for hydrogen generation. So, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the space that we tend to be working on from a technology standpoint. And then with respect to the spend, this is a long-term focus area for our facilities and businesses. And you can see from the progress we\u2019ve made with reducing greenhouse gases, it\u2019s not something new, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been after -- year after year after year and those opportunities continue to present themselves. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that with the new organization and new processes that we\u2019ve put in place, we\u2019ve got more direct and better line of sight to those opportunities that we can make sure they\u2019re getting funded and moving forward and that\u2019s all built into our plans and is built into our 2025 objectives that we\u2019ve laid out.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thanks. Very helpful detail. And sounds like a lot of exciting opportunities. My follow-up -- hopefully, a quicker one here. As you think about just the capital spending range over the next several years of $20 billion to $25 billion and contextualize that with the analysis that you had in the slides on the amount of cash flow contribution in 2025 and some of the new projects coming online. I was wondering if you could just help us pinpoint what level of spend that you think is required in order to just hold cash flow across the business flat over a multi-year period, understanding it\u2019s higher than the 2021 stand, some are within that $20 billion to $25 billion. Anyway, we can fine-tune that estimate a little bit in terms of the maintenance CapEx, the whole cash flow steady?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Well, I think the way we tend to look at it is, how you maximize the value. And we don\u2019t have an objective of finding old volumes or any other metric, it comes back to -- if -- what are the projects that we have available to us, the investments. What are the returns that we think we can generate from those investments? What advantage do they have versus industry and within our own portfolio? How robust are they to the price environment? So, I would say, that as we look to build up our investment profile, it\u2019s understanding what the value of those investments are. And then putting those in the context of the constraints that we\u2019re operating under to see which ones get funded and how we prioritize them. So, I would say, 2020, one of the things given the impacts of coronavirus and role on our balance sheet is we\u2019ve really prioritized and focused on the highest value first. We still got a really deep portfolio that we will continue to advance as the circumstances allow and as the market allows, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to kind of go forward. And that range that we\u2019ve given in the outer years is indicative of what we think it would be required to continue to fund that very attractive set of investments. Again, I\u2019ll come back to you, though, if the market and the price environment is not supportive of that, that will be a constraint that continues to moderate that capital. And as I\u2019ve shown -- I showed on the chart, we\u2019ve got lots of flexibility, particularly as you move out into the outer years to pull back if we feel like that\u2019s the best thing to do given the environment that we find ourselves in. Make sure we continue to pay a very strong dividend and maintain a balance sheet that\u2019s going to allow us to ride through the cycles and continue invest. Those are the three things and I would just say there is no hard formula. It\u2019s responding to the current circumstances and making sure that we\u2019re striking the right balance, because each of those plays are really important part in the value proposition for the corporation.\nDevin McDermott: Understood. Thanks again for taking my questions.\nDarren Woods: Thanks, Devin.\nStephen Littleton: Well, thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us to opportunity to highlight fourth quarter results. We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you and please stay safe.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephen. Good morning. It's good to be on the call. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. I'm sure I'm like many of you happy to close the book on 2020 and optimistic for the year ahead. As you know, the pandemic has had devastating impacts on people and businesses around the world. These effects were especially severe in our industry. And as you consumption collapsed as economies shut down, oil prices hit their lowest point in history and refining margins fell well below their 10 year lows. It was the first time in memory that we saw simultaneous lows in each of our businesses. As I discussed a year ago, our response throughout these challenging times was primarily focused on three areas, protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to support COVID response efforts, providing critical energy and products and aggressively reducing spend while preserving value to ensure we remained in the best possible position for the eventual recovery. We're pleased with how we performed on each of these. Our employees stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products from hand sanitizer, especially products for protective equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts, we kept operations running 24x7 while achieving strong safety results and exceptional reliability performance. At the same time we leveraged on the ongoing work in reorganizing our Upstream and Downstream businesses to significantly reduce costs and preserve value in an extremely challenging and uncertain market environment. We delivered on our cost reduction objectives and outperformed our revised plan, which we shared with even April. Going forward, we're continuing to work to reduce costs by leveraging synergies from aligned organizations and work processes across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. Further opportunities are being identified to reduce costs to drive cash flow and maintain our capital allocation priorities, including paying a strong dividend and maintaining a fortified balance sheet that we deleverage over time. I'll provide more detail momentarily on the successful efforts to drive greater efficiency across our businesses and further improve our cost structure. I'll also spend time discussing the significant steps we've taking to reduce emissions intensity and absolute emissions and our work to advance lower emission technologies like our newly announced Low Carbon Solutions business. Collectively, this will help position us as an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance while helping society move to a lower carbon future. Let me start though by highlighting a few notable achievements from 2020 and what was a very difficult business environment. During a year of unprecedented challenges, our people successfully managed our global operations, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products, while achieving best ever safety and reliability performance. We reduced cash operating expenses by more than 15%, including $3 billion of structural improvements and reduced capital investments by more than 30% to $21 billion, without compromising the advantages or value of our projects. We achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals for both methane and flaring and established new plans for 2025 that are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. These plans are expected to reduce absolute Upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. Permian basin volumes exceeded our plan at 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, despite curtailments and reduced investment. This performance was driven by significant ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and technology development. We progressed Liza Phase 2 and Payara developments in Guyana and continued our exploration success with three new discoveries, increasing the recoverable resource estimate on the Stabroek Block to nearly 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. Our Chemical business set a new record for polyethylene sales, reflecting the growth and demand for performance packaging, and strong operating performance of our expanding asset fleet. We maintained our position as a global leader in carbon capture, one we've held for more than 30 years by increasing sequester CO2 to more than 120 million tonnes. This is well over twice the next closest competitor and larger than the next five competitors combined. To put this in perspective, 122 million tonnes is equivalent to taking more than 25 million passenger vehicles off the road in a year. In 2020, we focused on managing through the impacts of an unprecedented industry environment, leveraging the strengths of our corporation to progress an industry leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities, critical to the long term success of the company. At the same time, we drove deep structural efficiencies to improve competitiveness and position ourselves amongst the industry's lowest cost of supply. Let me start with our efficiencies. You may recall that in 2019, we completed our corporate reorganizations, moving from functional companies to businesses organized along the value chains. This allowed us to reduce overhead and provided end-to-end oversight for each business, which was a critical first step in streamlining the businesses to structurally reduce cost. It also allowed us to more effectively prioritize work and focus on the highest value activities.  Consistent organizations across each sector are allowing us to consolidate like activities to fully leverage the corporation scale, further reducing costs and improving effectiveness. Our global projects organization was established in 2019 as a result of this approach. This organization has played a critical role in reoptimizing our global investment portfolio, improving the capital efficiency of each object and when necessary cost-effectively deferring work. As we came into 2020 and the pandemic, the organization changes provided the foundation for significantly reducing spend across the businesses. Expense results are shown in this chart, which is consistent with the charts Stephen showed, excluding production in taxes and energy expenses that are a function of commodity price. As you can see, 60% of the $5 billion reduction from 2019 to 2020 was structural, driven by reduced overheads and operational efficiencies. The remaining reductions were temporary, driven by lower production and activity deferrals. During last year's planning process, each organization identified opportunities to convert the short term or temporary expense reductions into permanent structural efficiencies. This year, we expect to achieve a further $1 billion of structural efficiencies. By 2023, we will achieve a total of $6 billion in structural expense reductions versus 2019. I expect even further reductions as we take advantage of additional synergies unlocked by consistently organized businesses. One final point to make on this Slide. The structural reductions we've shown are independent to the price environment we find ourselves. And on the other hand, returning activity and increased expenses between 2020 and 2023 are in large part, a function of the price environment. In lower price environments much of that increase would be further deferred. Let me now turn to another critical area, our capital investments. Over the past several years, we have been progressing a strategy to high-grade our asset base and improve the earnings and cash generation potential of our businesses. We announced work to invest less strategic assets and have been progressing a portfolio of industry leading investments. With pandemic driven losses, we responded quickly to bring capital spending in line with market conditions and an uncertain outlook and preserve our strong dividend. As we entered 2021, our capital plan is at a historic low, significantly reduced from 2020 levels. Our capital plans through 2025 reflected three key themes, value, flexibility, and discipline. Value derived from advancing our highest return, cash flow creative projects to deliver increased earnings and cash both near and long-term. Flexibility to respond to a dynamic market. We demonstrated this in 2020 and have developed our plans with this in mind. And discipline to make adjustments to our capital program depending on market conditions, to support a strong dividend and begin to deliver. Our plans are built on a price basis consistent with third-party outlooks and advance our highest return investments. They maintain a healthy balance sheet and our strong dividend. They're robust to a wide range of price scenarios, and using last year's experience and flexibility to respond to lower price environments.  In each plan year, we have a level of short cycle unconventional spend, which can be reduced in line with market conditions. We also expect to restart projects that have been suspended across this time horizon, but if necessary, can be delayed longer, further deferring spend. We also have a level of early investments that fund long-term growth opportunities. These two can be deferred or suspended. While each of these reductions impact the value of our plan they are available as circumstances warrant. Less flexible spend can also be reduced, but at a higher cost. This capital is generally longer cycle, more firmly committed or very near completion. The next slide helps quantify our capital flexibility. On the left of this graphic, we show available cash from operations for our 2021 plan at different rent prices, assuming the lowest refining and Chemical margins experienced from 2010 to 2019. This is our source with higher crew prices generating more available cash. As you move right, you see our uses, the current dividend and our 2021 CapEx from the previous page. As you can see, the breakeven Brent price needed to pay our dividend and invest in the low end of our flexible capital is roughly $45 a barrel. The Brent price required for 16 billion, which is the low end of our guidance and closer to where I expect our actual spend to be in 2021, is $50 a barrel. With Downstream and Chemical margins at the bottom of the 10 year historical range, we can fund our highest return investments in Guyana, the Permian in the Chemical business, and begin paying down debt at Brent prices, just above $50 a barrel. If Downstream and Chemical margins were at their 10 year averages, Brent breakeven prices would be roughly $5 a barrel lower, which would allow us to fund investments, pay the dividend and pay down debt at Brent prices above $45 a barrel. As we look at the market year-to-date actual prices in margins in total are above our plan, allowing us to progress our investments, pay the dividend and begin paying down debt in the first quarter. Obviously we're very early into the year and we know the market will change. We're keeping a close eye on developments and we'll adjust our capital spend accordingly, protecting the strong dividend and preserving the balance sheet. Let's shift to a later year in our plan, 2025. By 2025, we expect Downstream and Chemical margins to be off their lows and closer to a long-term average. In this case, we used the average margins for 2010 to 2019. In addition, we will see the full benefits of the structural OpEx improvements and additional cash from the projects that come online by 2025. As you can see there is substantially more flexibility in our capital spend. As a result, our plans continue to cover the dividend and capital investments at Brent prices as low as $35 a barrel. At Brent prices above $50 a barrel, our capital allocation framework supports our planned investments, further debt reduction and/or shareholder distributions. So as you can see, our plans were robust to a wide range of price environments, and while we are optimistic that the recent improvements in the macro environment will continue, we recognize that much could change over the next four to five years. If we face a year where Brent prices remained below $50 a barrel on a sustained basis, we would reduce investments to levels more consistent with this year's plan. Recognizing the market uncertainty we've attempted to strike the right balance between maintaining a strong dividend, fortifying the balance sheet to delever and continuing to invest in high return cash accretive projects. This last point is critical, particularly in a depletion business. The next chart gives a good perspective of this. Our investment strategy is focused on growing earnings and cash flow across a wide range of market environments. We are investing in advantage projects with some of the industry's lowest cost of supply. They grow earnings and cash flow in a variety of market environments. This graphic helps to illustrate this. Using IHS crude price and third-party margins, we expect the cash flow from project startups over our investment horizon to represent roughly 40% of our operating cash flow in 2025. This makes a critical point. You pay a significant long-term cost for excessive short term investment reductions.  And industry, does it collectively, the market pays with much higher commodity prices, striking the right balance, responding to short-term constraints with an eye on the mid to long-term generates the greatest value. Of course, in an investment portfolio of industry advantage projects is critical. The next slide provides a perspective of the investments we are making in developing Upstream resources, which represents the majority of our Upstream capital spend. This chart graphs cumulative Upstream capital spend to develop resources from 2021 through 2025 against the Brent price required for the investment to generate a 10% return, which we've deemed our cost of supply. As you can see, our focus on high return, lowest cost of supply investments, generate a portfolio with a cost of supply well below $3 a barrel. In fact, almost 90% of our investments in developing Upstream resources have they cost the supply of $35 per barrel or less. These investments generate an average return using third party price outlooks in excess of 30%. So as you can see, striking right balance, progressing a very attractive portfolio of investments or maintaining our strong dividend in fortifying the balance sheet to delever is essential to maximizing value, both near term and long-term. When executed in period where others are pulling back and construction markets or slack, these investments become even more attractive. When you factor in the flexibility of our short cycle investments in the Permian where the value proposition continues to grow, we are well positioned. We have an attractive investment portfolio that we can flex with market conditions to strike the right balance across our capital allocation priorities. Let me now take a few minutes to highlight the progress we've been making in the Permian. Despite challenging conditions and a rapid change in activity, our progress in the Permian exceeded our plan and its expectations. These improvements reflect the hard work of our people. The organizational changes made in 2019 and the continued evolution of our technology and techniques. In 2019, we better integrated the experience of our global drilling, technology and project organizations with the unconventional operating organization. Working together, they made a step change in performance that continues to improve. 2020 drilling rates were 50% better than our planned and more than 20% better than full year 2019 results. Drilling and completion costs were 15% below our plan and more than 25% lower than 2019 results. We estimate that roughly two thirds of the savings were due to improve performance. As an example, the number of frac stages achieved in a day increased by 30% versus 2019. As we enter 2021, we continue to see progress in our key performance metrics, further growing the value of this resource and improving upon our plans. In 2020, capital expenditures in the Permian were 35% below plan. Despite significant economic curtailments in the second quarter, 2020 volumes of 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day exceeded our plan, about 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, above 2019. Going forward, with the pandemic related impacts on our balance sheet and market outlook, we are pacing Permian investments to maintain positive free cash flow, delever industry leading capital efficiency and achieve double digit returns at less than $35 a barrel. Based on the current market price projections our plans results in Permian volumes of approximately 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by 2025. If demand and prices are lower than current third-party outlooks, we'll adjust our plans. At a nominal Brent price of $50 a barrel through 2025, we would expect to deliver an additional a 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2025 versus 2020 production levels. Key point here is that we have flexibility in options, which I expect to improve with time. We've been making significant progress in our technology programs, which are contributing to current performance. With the advances we are making, I expect continued improvements in productivity, growing volumes at even lower cost. Hopefully, the Permian discussion and broader overview of our investment plans provided a useful perspective on the opportunities we have and the balance we are attempting to strike across our capital allocation priorities, amid an uncertain market outlook. I'd like to move on to the results we've achieved in lowering our emissions and the plans we have for further reductions, but before I do, I'd like to recap some key points. Our portfolio offers the best collection of investment opportunities we've had in over 20 years. We have some of industry's lowest cost of supply projects with strong returns that are robust to low prices. Coupled with our expense efficiencies, our capital program through 2025 improves the earnings power and cash generation potential of our asset base in both the near and long-term. Leveraging our experience for 2020, we've built flexible plans that will allow us to adjust to market developments and potentially lower prices. If prices move higher than our plan basis, this will allow us to more quickly replenish our balance sheet. Our plans strike the right balance, growing value, maintaining strong dividend and a fortified balance sheet that is delevered over time. Let's turn to our work and position the company for a lower carbon energy future. Addressing the risk of climate change is one of society's biggest challenges, requiring the combined effort and collaboration of governments, academia, businesses and consumers. ExxonMobil has spent decades researching new technologies and deploying existing ones to lower our emissions and the emissions of our customers. Today, we remain committed to this. We plan to position ExxonMobil as a leader in our industry. Since its inception, we have supported the goals of the Paris Agreement, engaging in climate-related policies and supporting a tax on carbon. Since 2016, the year of the Paris Agreement, we've reduced our operating greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Last year, we met the reduction objectives we set in 2018. And in the fourth quarter announced new emission reduction plans for 2025 that are consistent with the goals of Paris. Our plan to reduce emissions from operated assets and align the company with the World Bank's initiative to eliminate routine flaring. To reduce the intensity of our operating upstream greenhouse gas emissions, we drive a decrease in methane intensity and a decrease in flaring intensity. This is expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% and absolute methane and flaring emissions by 40% to 50% versus 2016 levels. Our plans continue to invest in lower emissions initiatives, with an expect to spend up more than $500 million a year. This includes energy efficiency, TCS investments, cogeneration, research and development and renewable purchases, an area where we already make a significant contribution. Today, we are the second largest buyer of wind and solar power in the oil and gas industry and among the top 5% across all corporations, purchasing roughly 600 megawatts. While we don't bring a significant competitive advantage to many wind and solar projects, we can leverage our size to support world scale developments with purchase contracts hoping to ensure they are built. We're also the world's leader in carbon capture, responsible for over 40% of the CO2 capture. To put this into context, the nature conservatory announced a campaign in 2008 to plant a 1 billion trees. Our cumulative CO2 capture is more than double that goal. We're also one of the world's largest producers of hydrogen. As the potential for this and the energy transition develops, we are well-positioned to leverage our experience, scale and technology to contribute. In fact, to ensure that we effectively leverage all of our technologies, experiences and expertise, yesterday we announced the formation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This business will focus on advancing commercial CCS opportunities and deploying emerging technologies as they mature. I'll come back to our plans for this in a moment as we expect it to underpin our long-term strategy in driving emission reductions. I want to first focus on the progress we've already made. As you can see in this chart, since the inception of the Paris Agreement, ExxonMobil has made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, down 6% significantly outpacing the progress made by society as a whole. Over the past 20 years, we have invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower emissions energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations. During that time, we eliminated or avoided about 480 million tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 100 million cars. The plans we announced in December further reduce the intensity of our businesses, delivering an expected reduction in emissions of roughly 12% by 2025. I want to pause here for a minute and emphasize that these are not targets. These reductions are built into our base plans. In conjunction with the reorganizations completed in 2019, we established a more rigorous process to capture emission reduction efforts at operating units around the world. Plans developed in 2020 leverage this process and built in additional efficiency steps and accretive investments to deliver these reductions. Like other plan objectives, the performance of our businesses and our senior management will be evaluated based on achieving these commitments. I think it's important to point out that our plans are in line with the stated ambitions of the Paris Agreement, which you can see on the next chart. This slide overlays both global and ExxonMobil emissions since 2016 with the goals of the Paris Agreement, hypothetical 1.5 degree and two degree Celsius pathways. As you can see, our plans are consistent with the stated ambitions. Of course, the challenge will be maintaining our progress into the future for both ExxonMobil and society at large. Today, the set of solutions available in overcoming this challenge is incomplete. There is a gap between what is needed and what is available. This is illustrated by the 2016 Paris submissions shown by the green diamond, which is an estimate of the signatories nationally determined contributions. We are working to close this gap and help provide solutions for society. Our investment in R&D is focused on the world's highest emitting sectors, manufacturing, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for 80% of global energy related carbon emissions and where today's alternatives are insufficient. As I said earlier, through 2025, we expect to invest more than $3 billion in lower emissions initiatives, which include energy efficient process technology, advanced biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, which is a crucial technology for achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Carbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in addressing emissions from difficult to decarbonize sectors. This is also generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions. And the two degree scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is estimated that in 2040, 10% of total energy will require CCS. It's also estimated that 15% of global emissions will be mitigated by CCS. If carbon capture and storage does not progress and play a significant role in decarbonizing the economy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the society's cost of achieving a two degree outcome would more than double, increasing the cost by 138%. In short, the world is unlikely to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement without focused action and the innovation in carbon capture and storage. Unfortunately, according to the IEA, its development and deployment are not on track. This is an area where we can potentially leverage unique capabilities to make a difference. ExxonMobil has been the global leader in carbon capture for more than 30 years. We believe there is an opportunity to leverage our deep operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution skills, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology to uniquely contribute in this area. In 2018, we formed a carbon capture venture to identify and develop potential CCS opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies. This group has been working with governments, industry, academia and tech companies to advanced projects. Today, we have more than 20 opportunities under evaluation. With increasing government focus, growing market demand and additional investor interest, we are increasing our emphasis in this area through the establishment of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This new business will continue to progress the ongoing venture work, while looking to expand other commercial opportunities from our extensive low carbon technology portfolio. The business will focus its efforts on solutions critical to achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, work with governments around the world to promote the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and partner with interested parties to achieve improvements at scale.  While new, this business will hit the ground running, incorporating the existing venture organization and a healthy pipeline of potential opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information as this effort advances. Before we open the lines for your questions, let me close by reiterating our areas of focus. Delivering world class safety and reliability, driving structural cost reductions, advancing a flexible portfolio of high return, cost advantage investments, maintaining the strong dividend and fortified balance sheet and reducing emissions while developing needed technologies to support the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Our people delivered in these areas last year, despite the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. I'm absolutely confident they will deliver even more this year and into the future. I hope I've given you a deeper understanding of our strategy and plans for 2021 and beyond. I look forward to providing you with more detail during our March Investor Day and as the year progresses. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Good morning, Doug. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Thanks for the question. And before I answer that let me just take a minute to congratulate you on your pending retirement, well-earned... I miss having you in the mix. With respect to your comment and the delivery of some of the improvements we've made, I just maybe step back and provide a little perspective on the journey we've been on, as we looked at the business and focused on the opportunities to improve performance over time, we recognize the need as a capital-intensive industry to make sure that we had a very healthy and attractive set of capital investment opportunities, which is what we focused on at the beginning to recognize the size of that opportunity and the leverage that it gives us with respect to earnings and cash flow. And so, as you heard, early on with my tenure that's what I was focused. We generated a very, very attractive set of investments. At the same time, we were progressing an organizational restructuring, the move from this functional organization that we had put in place at the time of the merger of Exxon Mobile, which served its purposes and added a lot of value at the time as we brought those two companies together. But with time, recognize the need to move to an organization that had a better line of sight end-to-end on the business and a more direct accountability for profit and loss. And we completed that transition in 2019. And I think, last year in the March analyst meeting, I mentioned that we were focused on taking advantage of the new organization to drive efficiencies. And I would say 2020 delivered on that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see more opportunity down the road and have actually built into our plans for 2020 these improved efficiencies. And so that's what I would tell you is the foundation of the plans that we've got and the improvement opportunities that we see going forward independent of where the market takes us. Then on top of that, obviously, and as we said back in our third quarter call with where the impact of the pandemic and the price response to the loss of economic activity, we recognize that that had to be a temporary downturn, just because of the fundamentals associated with the industry and wanted to make sure that we prepared ourselves for what would be an eventual recovery recognizing the timing of that is somewhat uncertain. And I would say, as we sit here today, I'd still characterize as somewhat uncertain, although encouraging here over the last several months. But we haven't -- we're not kind of taking that to the bank, so to speak, we're prepared and keeping an eye on how the market develops and we'll respond accordingly. So, I feel good about where we're at today. I think we've got our company in a position and our organization, focused on the right things. And then we've got an opportunity set with flexibility that we can execute as we go forward. And as I said, as I look at the first quarter where we're ahead of where we thought we were going to be and we'll already start to delever and continue to progress our investment. So, I feel as good as you can given some of the uncertainty out there with the residual pandemic effects. Right. I think, as you saw last year when we've been talking about, we're really trying to focus the activity on the highest value, highest return, lowest cost of capital at which has meant prioritizing investments and high-grading the portfolio. So, we announced a divestment program, something that we hadn't historically not done and have been out prosecuting that divestment program. We've got assets in the market today. But as we said at the time we announced it and continues to be the underlying principle associated with a divestment program is -- it's a value-driven program. So, we're looking to make sure that we can find a buyer that values the assets, cease more opportunity than we can prosecute with the asset. And so that is what drives the decision.  Obviously, last year with all the uncertainty, wasn't a whole lot of activity in this space, although we did make some progress. We have mechanisms with respect to the deals that can accommodate some of the price uncertainty, and that's going to continue on -- I would say as the market recovers and people's views develop more fully, I expect we'll have additional advancements in that program. Thank you, Doug. Best of luck. Good morning, Neil. Yes. I will confirm my -- that was the comment I made. I do expect to be on the lower end of that range. And then, our plan with respect to debt -- we talked about in the third quarter, we kind of set a hard limit of around $70 billion. We didn't want to go above that and working hard to bring that down, expect for that to come down in the first quarter. And we'll continue to work to bring that down to really rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. There's one of the three capital allocation priorities, and we think absolutely critical to underpin the business we've got going forward and to ride through the cycles that we face. And clearly, 2020 was a very deep down cycle, one that frankly, we've never seen before. And I'm pleased that the capital structure we had in place and our ability to respond to that unprecedented marketing environment that was very successful. We leveraged the use of the balance sheet, obviously, and we're now going to rebuild that to have the capacity we need to continue to weather the ups and downs of the cycles that we know will happen as we go forward. Yes. Sure, Neil. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on speculation in the press. But what I would say is the approach that we take in this space has been pretty consistent. And we've talked about that over the years. And it's really looking for value opportunities where there's another company that we can leverage synergies, leverage a different port -- differences in portfolios that basically have compliment one another. We look at a lot of things and that whole space we've been active in that for quite some time. We continue to be active to look for opportunities to grow value, unique value. And that's kind of what drives in our mind the opportunity. And, as you know, we talked about that past, having always found opportunities that we felt were valued correctly or valued in line with what would be required to kind of extract unique value through an acquisition or a merger. But we continue to look in that space and it will be an active program going forward. Thank you, Neil. Sure. Well, good morning, Doug and happy New Year to you as well. What I'd say is, last year clearly was unprecedented event something that forced some dramatic action in the industry as a whole and our company. And as we leverage the new organization and reconfigured our plans in response to the pandemic and the consequences of that, we changed a lot of things and operating under a new set of constraints, obviously drawing down our balance sheet to the point that we did required a different approach going forward. And so that was the focus and rebuilding the plans for 2020. And as I've said I think the organization as a whole responded very, very well to the challenging conditions, not only in operating our businesses in the environment, but at the same time, putting together very thorough well thought out plans for how we would go forward and accommodate the increased uncertainty and the recovery that we knew we had to make coming out of the pandemic. And frankly, If we put those plans together, we recognize that was a change from the past and our past plans and wanting to make sure that we effectively communicated that going forward. So, we had a very early release at the back end of the year after the Board approved the plans that provided some perspective with the intent of coming into this call and more thoroughly taking the community -- investment community through more details of that plan. And that's what we've been doing here. All the things we've talked about, as you can clearly tell, if you look at the materiality of it and its work that's been underway for quite some time. I'd say 2020 a lot of effort by the organization to put those together. And our intent is to make sure that we keep the outside community kind of up-to-date with those plans given the constraints that we're operating under. Sure. Yes. I think -- so, we've built the plan based on the three capital allocation priorities I touched on as part of my prepared remarks and try to optimize the value to the corporation, recognizing that if you look at the portfolio and the underlying strategy that we embarked on back in 2017/2018 timeframe, that remains in place. The even stress testing the projects and the investment opportunities we've had we have in the portfolio continue to look attractive in this environment. You saw the Upstream portfolio, which is the biggest part of our spend show that. So, our intent then is to kind of pace that investment as we move forward, reflective of the market environment. And we've structured the capital program, again, consistent with the experience that we had last year and the drawdown that we had in capital to make sure that we have flexibility to adjust. If you think about what we've put in that flexible bucket, there is a large chunk of or a piece of short-term -- the short cycle investments in the Permian where we clearly have flexibility. We've got pace projects, so things that are Global Projects organization as we were working to reoptimize the capital program, I think very cost-effectively and working with our EPC partners suspended some of that projects, but put them in warm standby so that we can start those back-up again. That's in our flexible spending. And as I mentioned, we've got some longer term spend to fill the pipeline early on so that we've got things as we move outside the plan period. So, all those things are -- and if we can make decisions in real-time about whether we continue to progress those or pull back in that area depending on what the environments at. And because we can do that and as we've pointed out in these charts that we've shown, we've got lots of flexibility under different price environments to sustain the dividend. So, we feel really good about where we're at today that we've got good upside with respect to growing the cash flow, as I've showed. But at the same time, if we need to and the environment dictates, we can pull back. I think that's the optimal position as to develop options, to have the flexibility to adjust if you need to. We're very keen not to pull things back to a point where we didn't have plans to take advantage of the portfolio that we had if the market environment was better than what many were thinking of last year. So, our intent was build plans that are as best as possible what the market expects and then be positioned to pull down if necessary. Going in with no plan trying to ramp up is a lot harder than going in with a plan and coming down. Great. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, Phil. Sure, Phil. I'd kind of come back to we don't know where prices are going to go. And I think we have not tried build plans based on speculating where prices will go. Instead what we've tried to do is build plans based on what a reasonable assumption is. And when I say reasonable, we test our price bases against kind of third-party and where the market -- generally the market is. And our expectation is to be kind of within and certainly on the lower end of the price expectations and that's how we build the plans. We recognized when we put that together that those prices probably aren't going to materialize and could be higher or lower and so they'll have flexibility in. I wouldn't read anything into how high we went on that chart. I mean it's kind of just a -- it was a number that we pick. The higher it goes, the better off obviously we're at. And I would tell you our first priority above and beyond the plan if we see a price environment that's higher than we have anticipated, it would be to continue to delever and to rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. Because again I would tell you -- and as I've talked about today and in the past, balancing across the three capital allocation priorities is absolutely critical and you take different decisions in the short-term. Last year when we recognized we were in a very deep downturn, one that we also believe would be temporary, prioritized the dividend and made sure that we continue to pay that and grew on the balance sheet. As we come out of that, which is what we expected, our plan is to rebuild the balance sheet so that we can be in a position going forward to absorb what other shocks come in the future. And at the same time, we wanted to make sure that we are continuing to invest in these accretive projects, because ultimately they are going to underpin the long-term success of the corporation. So, I'd say the key word as we work through the last year is balance. And I'd say the other one is optionality, flexibility. And that's what the plan now reflects and what we've talked about today. Yes. What you see on the Downstream in that chart 30, we've put a kind of a January estimate and there is some kind of where we are at currently, and it's still well outside that historic range. So, I think today if you look at the industry as a whole across the globe where margins are at, it's not a sustainable position just because of the losses that are accruing. And if you look back in history, I think, there is a certain physics associated with these businesses that say, it can only go so low before you're not covering your cost and you're bleeding cash, so you're going to have to make adjustments. And that historical range, in my mind, kind of sets those limits. I mean, these are commodity businesses. And if you take a price that goes below the marginal cost of supply, it's going to end up costing industry as a whole and eventually players will rationalize and drop out. And that -- for as long as I've been in the Downstream, that business has been long supply and it's a slow process to rationalize it tight, particularly as more refineries come on out in Asia. So, I think what you're seeing there is the time cycle associated with rebalancing the markets and the supply demand balance. Obviously, demand is off pretty significantly what was already kind of marginally long business. So, it'll be a function of demand coming back and how quickly that recovers and then continued rationalization. As Stephen said, we've seen last year much higher levels of rationalization and my expectation would be if we don't see the margins recover backed within that band, you'll continue to see that. I think it's very dependent upon how the recovery goes, how the economies pick back up again. I think it's -- there is a mix view and we've tried to be pretty conservative in our planning just recognizing the mechanisms required to rebalance the market that's going to take time. My expectation is the second half of the year will look a lot better than the first half. But exactly where we end up on that bar, I think it's tough to tell. I think, eventually, we will get back there. If not, back into this year, sometime into next year and potentially see an overcorrection, so to speak, as demand continues to pick up and with the reduced supply, we'll see that tightness in the supply demand marketplace self out in the Downstream is what I would expect. The challenge with all these things -- I'm talking about very fundamental things. It's not a question of if that's going to happen, but when. And I think that's -- I think the trick in this game and our view is you should recognize it's coming, but not build the plan based on the hope that it does. Thank you, Phil. Yes. Sure, Jon. So, on the CCS, I think -- and as I indicated and as I've talked, I think for as long as I've been publicly speaking about this is, we've recognized that carbon capture and storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of Paris Agreement. And one of the things that we've noticed over time is -- and I think the IEA described it as momentum in this space is that we're beginning to see a broader recognition of the importance of that technology. I think the industry for a long time is recognized, but I think more broadly it's being recognized as an important part of the solutions set in terms of achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. So, we've been working for quite some time on the technology and trying to address the cost side of that to find a technology that was lower in cost, which would then make the opportunities more attractive and accelerate the deployment of CCS. And so, a lot of work over the years on the -- what I'd say is the fundamental process technology in the way that can actually concentrate CO2. And as we look at that portfolio, we've been advancing. There is more work to be done there for sure, still technology developments that we've got to progress. But we're now seeing, I think, with the increased recognition of the need for this technology, governments being more amenable to and understanding and recognizing the need for policy frameworks and regulatory frameworks, legal frameworks to support establishing CCS. We're seeing investor demand, where people are interested in investing those types of projects. So, I think there is money that's looking for opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. And then there is a market growing for reduction credits. We see a lot of things, a lot of market developments and momentum in the market as a whole, which all contribute to building a sustainable business. And so, we felt like, given where things we want to, now is the time to bring a more concerted effort in this space and start making sure that we're staffed and we've got people working hard, engaging with governments to help move all those things along. If you look at that portfolio of products that we've got today, one of the biggest challenges is in the policy and regulatory framework space. And so, that's a real focus area. And I think certainly here in the U.S. we've got an administration that's interested in progressing in this space and we're there and are ready to talk with them and help provide some perspective from an industry standpoint. We think the timing is right and we think we've got -- we've put the right people in this new organization to kind of move that forward. But it will be I think this is a complex area. There are a lot of variables at play that we've got to bring together and we need to make sure that we got our senior management focused on bringing those things together. On your CapEx, 2021 CapEx, you're right, that is the low CapEx number for us. In fact, if you look at the history and going back in time since Exxon and Mobil merged, it's the lowest level of capital spend that we've had in any year. And so, I think it's fair to say, just using history as a guide that that's probably not a sustainable level of CapEx. And it is a response to the environment that we found ourselves in and the recovery that we're making coming out of that environment. And I think longer term going forward, which is one of the reasons why our 2022 through 2025 range in guidance is higher. It's just a recognition that in a more steady state environment, the spend needs to be higher to support kind of the growth and to underpin the capital allocation priorities we have. You bet Jonathon. Good morning, Sam. Yes. Sure. I think the point you make, Sam, is the one maybe I was trying to hit on with Jonathon is, this market demand in terms of people looking for cleaner options and offsets and emission reduction steps. And so, we think there's an opportunity there with that with many of our -- the products in our portfolio. And we see that across, frankly, all of our sectors, the Downstream, you mentioned gas, we certainly see that there in gas and we see opportunities from -- in terms of our recycling or environmentally improved footprint in the Chemical business as well. So, I think, that -- as I mentioned, the momentum that we're seeing broadly in this space is opening up market opportunities, which we think this business can take -- get engaged with and make sure that we are contributing where we can. I mentioned, these -- to make a difference and move the needle, there needs to be fairly broad investment over time and we have a lot of capabilities that lend itself to that. Not only do we have the technology work that we've been doing, we've got a projects organization that knows how to scale up technologies and apply. Then we have a manufacturing footprint that we can take advantage of. We've got a very good understanding of subsurface and how that works. We've got midstreams in pipeline. So, we -- if you look at the different elements that have to go into successfully building a CCS business is very consistent with what we do today and very much in our wheelhouse. So, we see that as an opportunity. And frankly, the challenge has been the development of the market and the needs here. And again as we see the momentum in that grow, we see that opportunity. So I think that's the work and what we're focused on doing here. Well, I would tell you, in part forming this -- moving from venture to a full blown business is the -- one of the advantages within the company is that brings that business into our plan process where we can put together marketing and business plans, put together annual plans and lay all that opportunity. And I would tell you, Sam, this is the year that we will do that with this business. We'll give Joe a chance to get in the chair and then get his organization focused on marketing and business plan and then translating that into our company plan process and then at the end of the year we'll have -- we'll start to kind of track that like we do all the other businesses. And so, I'd say that's a question that we'll answer as we go forward and look at these opportunities, made a big variable in all of this is just, there is a lot of things that have to come together to make these things move and progress. And so, part of it is a function of how that external market moves, part of it's a function of how quickly the governments respond and put in the right kind of regulatory and policy frameworks. And so, I think it's a complicated space, but it's one that a very consistent with what we've historically done. And so, I feel pretty optimistic that we can come in and contribute and actually help in this space, and it's very consistent with our competencies and capabilities. And so, this is the space that we feel like where we can contribute and help society reduce their emissions. So -- but I would say stay tuned, there is a lot of work that has to happen here. And as we develop that, we'll be sharing with you how we see that the potential here and how these opportunities are developing. Thank you, Sam. Good morning, Devin. Yes. I would say -- so we've got -- we've had a very active technology portfolio across this whole space. You may recall in the past, I've talked about our energy centers, we've got around the world where we've partnered with universities, very focused on investing in areas where we see the potential for alternatives. Biofuels is an area where we've got a number of different technology drives to for -- to see if we can develop more cost effective biofuels that work at scale. A lot of work in process technology and how we take existing processes and make them more energy efficient, less emissions associated with them. So, trying to leverage some of the new materials that are out there. I'd say, we've got a really broad spectrum of opportunities we've been working on. We've got relationships with 80 universities where we're not necessarily steering that technology work, but we are participating in it. And as we see those technologies advance and look -- and get higher potential -- have a higher potential of those things, we would look to try to bring into the portfolio. So, we got -- what I'd say, we've cast a pretty wide net around the technology space, recognizing that it's requiring some level of evolution, if not, breakthroughs in technologies for them to be successful. And so, since you can't really plan for that we kind of keep our finger on the pulse of a lot of different technologies with the intent then to -- as they look more promising, but it bring them into the emerging and then commercial technology space. And so, that's the work that this new group will be focused on. And again, we'll complement what we're doing in the carbon capture and storage. We've got the biofuels work that we've been doing, and we've got the process technology work that we've been doing and a lot of those things overlap with one and other. Certainly -- and, of course, that then also has hydrogen and the process technology work we're doing and the CCS work together have a lot of overlap with potential for hydrogen generation. So, I'd say that's the space that we tend to be working on from a technology standpoint. And then with respect to the spend, this is a long-term focus area for our facilities and businesses. And you can see from the progress we've made with reducing greenhouse gases, it's not something new, it's something we've been after -- year after year after year and those opportunities continue to present themselves. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that with the new organization and new processes that we've put in place, we've got more direct and better line of sight to those opportunities that we can make sure they're getting funded and moving forward and that's all built into our plans and is built into our 2025 objectives that we've laid out. Yes. Well, I think the way we tend to look at it is, how you maximize the value. And we don't have an objective of finding old volumes or any other metric, it comes back to -- if -- what are the projects that we have available to us, the investments. What are the returns that we think we can generate from those investments? What advantage do they have versus industry and within our own portfolio? How robust are they to the price environment? So, I would say, that as we look to build up our investment profile, it's understanding what the value of those investments are. And then putting those in the context of the constraints that we're operating under to see which ones get funded and how we prioritize them. So, I would say, 2020, one of the things given the impacts of coronavirus and role on our balance sheet is we've really prioritized and focused on the highest value first. We still got a really deep portfolio that we will continue to advance as the circumstances allow and as the market allows, and that's how we're going to kind of go forward. And that range that we've given in the outer years is indicative of what we think it would be required to continue to fund that very attractive set of investments. Again, I'll come back to you, though, if the market and the price environment is not supportive of that, that will be a constraint that continues to moderate that capital. And as I've shown -- I showed on the chart, we've got lots of flexibility, particularly as you move out into the outer years to pull back if we feel like that's the best thing to do given the environment that we find ourselves in. Make sure we continue to pay a very strong dividend and maintain a balance sheet that's going to allow us to ride through the cycles and continue invest. Those are the three things and I would just say there is no hard formula. It's responding to the current circumstances and making sure that we're striking the right balance, because each of those plays are really important part in the value proposition for the corporation. Thanks, Devin. Thank you."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Before getting started, I wanted to say that I hope all of you on the call, your families and colleagues are safe, in light of the challenges our world continues to face as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. Joining me today are, Senior Vice President of ExxonMobil, Andy Swiger, the Corporation's Principal Financial Officer; and Jack Williams, who oversees the Downstream and Chemical businesses. After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Andy and Jack will provide their perspective, including an update on the steps we're taking to navigate the current market environment. Following those remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results while Andy and Jack will take your questions on broader themes, including market dynamics and the recovery, the corporations response, our financial and strategic priorities, progress on our drive for efficiencies and updates on major projects. Our comments this morning will reference to slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I'll now highlight developments since the second quarter of this year on the next slide. In the Upstream liquids realizations increased by approximately 75% with demand and prices recovering from lows encountered in the second quarter. This more than offset lower gas realizations. As market conditions improve all economic curtailments were brought back online by the end of the quarter. However, government mandated curtailments continue through the quarter. Despite the considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, we have been able to achieve our best ever safety and best reliability performance in the Upstream in five years. We continue to progress industry awareness developments in Guyana with the FID of Payara. In addition, we announced two new discoveries on the Stabroek block, Yellowtail and Redtail, marking our 17th and 18th discoveries in Guyana. In the Downstream, we achieved the best reliability and safety performance in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, industry refining margins fell to record lows, reflecting continued excess industry capacity and high levels of product inventory. Bottom of the cycle conditions persist in the chemical business with margins falling from the second quarter, primarily impacted by higher feedstock cost. Demand remained resilient. We continued strength in the packaging and hygiene segments and recovery in the automotive and construction sectors. Across the corporation, we reduced CapEx by over $1 billion from the second quarter, making further progress towards our 30% reduction target. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to annually purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel for five years starting in 2022. We also expanded a joint agreement with Global Thermostat to advance and scale direct air capture technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of our third quarter results. The table on the left, provides a view of third quarter results relative to the second quarter. Starting with the second quarter, the reported loss of $1.1 billion included favorable identified items of $1.9 billion, driven by the non-cash inventory adjustments we noted in the second quarter. Excluding these items, the second quarter was a loss of $3 billion. Third quarter results were a loss of $700 million, including a $100 million non-cash benefit from inventory valuation. Excluding identified items, there was a $800 million loss in the third quarter, a $2.2 billion improvement from the second quarter. Significant improvement in Upstream liquids price was partially offset by lower gas realizations, as well as lower refining margins. Higher volumes across all three of our businesses increased earnings by $700 million as demand continued to recover from the unprecedented levels seen in the second quarter. Finally, lower operating expenses improved earnings by an additional $200 million compared to the second quarter. It's worth noting that the benefit of OpEx savings delivered by our organization increased earnings by $1 billion versus the third quarter of 2019. On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of results for each business. Note that the earnings comments are excluding identified items. Upstream earnings increased by approximately $1.5 billion, driven by higher liquids prices, partially offset by lower gas realizations, mainly due to a lag crude index LNG contract pricing. Volume impacts, including the recovery of economic curtailments, increased earnings by $140 million. Lower expenses, including the benefits of captured structural efficiencies, improved earnings by another $110 million. Moving to Slide 6, is a comparison of third quarter 2020 results relative to the third quarter 2019. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $2.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2019, reflecting the current price environment. The unfavorable volume impact was driven by curtailments and divestments. Lower production and exploration expenses were offset by unfavorable one-time tax items. On Slide 7, Upstream volumes increased by 34,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the second quarter. With the challenging market conditions, we curtail production in unconventional and heavy oil assets starting in April, by the end of September, those volumes were back online. Government mandated reductions were implemented in May and continued through the third quarter. Those curtailments average 140,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite the environment, we achieved growth of 50,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, primarily in the Permian. Scheduled maintenance, and a third-party diluent supply outage at Kearl, decreased volumes by 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Decline was partially offset by higher entitlements. Moving to Slide 8, compared to the third quarter of 2019, Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 230,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Volumes were lower due to curtailments mentioned on the prior slide, as well as the divestment of our Norway non-operated assets at the end of 2019. Despite the current business environment, we saw continued liquids growth from Permian, Abu Dhabi and Guyana. Moving to the Downstream on Slide 9, earnings increased by approximately $380 million, relative to the second quarter. Margins increased by $70 million, despite record low industry margins, which decreased earnings by $470 million; favorable trading, supply chain impacts, marketing margins more than offset these impacts. Demand recovery, primarily in road transportation fuels and in lubricants, increased earnings by $300 million. We spared about 25% of refining capacity in the third quarter. Reduced expenses, including savings from maintenance and turnaround efficiencies and fewer contractors, increased earnings by $60 million. Moving to the next slide, I will discuss downstream results relative to the third quarter 2019. Earnings decreased approximately $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the low industry margin environment I just discussed. This was partially offset by $400 million of favorable trading, optimization and marketing margins. Lower volumes associated with COVID-19 demand destruction decreased earnings by $80 million. We continue to see the benefit of expense reductions and efficiencies, which improved earnings by $360 million. On Slide 11, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings increased by almost $200 million for the second quarter. Lower margins, reduced earnings by $80 million reflecting higher feedstock costs. Strong reliability, coupled with improved demand, resulted in higher volumes, which increased earnings by $220 million. It is worth noting, in the third quarter, polyethylene sales were a record high. This also highlights our strong reliability in the quarter. We continue to capture market and supply chain efficiencies. Reduced expenses, including reduced contracted utilization and activity pacing, improved earnings by $40 million. Turning to Slide 12, chemical earnings increased by more than $300 million relative to the third quarter of 2019. Earnings improved due to higher margins from lower fee costs and higher sales volumes. We also benefited from our cost reduction efforts, which improved earnings by $170 million in the quarter. The next slide provides an update on the progress we made reducing our costs. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15%. Through the third quarter, we are on track to exceed the reduction target, delivering additional cost savings. Cash operating costs are approximately 20% lower versus the third quarter of 2019, and are down almost 15% relative to the first quarter of this year. The cost reductions reflect decreased activity, maintenance and turnaround efficiencies, reduced contractor rates and lower logistics and supply chain costs. The reorganization of our businesses, along with value chains, has been critical in identifying and delivering these improvements. Importantly, we have realized these savings while improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operations. Now moving on to capital spend on Slide 14. Third quarter capital spending was down more than 20% versus the second quarter. Reductions continue to be driven by pacing of short cycle unconventional investment. In the third quarter, we also reduced Downstream product spin as we ramped down activity. Importantly, our corporate project organization in collaboration with our contractors have managed to more than offset the cost of deferral preserving the overall value of the projects. Jack will share some additional details later in the call on this. Let's turn to the next page, where you can see the impact of these activities on our cash profile. Third quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $4.4 billion from the second quarter, with higher crude prices, increased volumes, and the benefits of OpEx savings. We also saw a benefit from working capital with lower product inventory. Gross debt decreased by about $700 million to $68.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 16. I will cover a few key considerations for the fourth quarter. In the Upstream, production is expected to remain in line with the third quarter. The announced government mandated production curtailments are expected to average 220,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, an increase of approximately 80,000 oil them barrels from the third quarter. The impacts of increased curtailments are anticipated to be offset by seasonally higher European gas demand. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand to be roughly in line with the third quarter with higher scheduled maintenance. In Chemical, we anticipate margins to be impacted by increased supply from capacity additions and improved industry utilization, with a recovery from hurricanes and reliability events. Our scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter, Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated, they'll be about $900 million. Capital spending is expected to be higher than the third quarter with one time milestone project payments. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy.\nAndrew Swiger: Thank you, Stephen. First and foremost, we hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As we've discussed on previous calls, the challenges presented by COVID-19 are unlike anything the industry has ever seen, as is the response of our employees and contractors. They have gone to great lengths to safely maintain operations, manufacture and deliver the products society needs for sanitation and hygiene, as well as provide the fuels that ensure these and other critical supplies get to the places they are needed. They have responded to unprecedented market conditions with all three of our businesses at, or significantly below, bottom of cycle conditions. We could not be more proud of the exceptional efforts and response of our workforce. We are navigating this near-term uncertainty by achieving record safety and reliability performance, delivering better than expected cash savings that are on pace to exceed our 2020 OpEx and CapEx targets, while maintaining operations integrity and pacing projects to preserve long-term value and position us for the eventual recovery. This slide shows the demand impact of the pandemic. The corresponding industry response and third party projections for the market recovery after the second quarter lows. Crude and product inventories rose to a peak in June as the reduction in demand outpaced supply cuts. In the third quarter, inventories have started to fall as demand recovers and exceeds current supply levels. Third-party estimates suggest liquids inventory decreased by about 200 million barrels in the third quarter and they expect demand to return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. Of course, the demand projections shown here, lead to a few critical questions. How will the supplier respond? What will be the resulting supply and demand balance? And what price is required to achieve this? In light of this, it is worth looking at the fundamentals. I'll start with the next slide with Upstream supply. In the Upstream, which is a depletion business, capital investment is required to add supply to offset ongoing decline. This chart shows an obvious, but sometimes overlooked relationship. Industry investment levels rise and fall at price or more specifically the industry's level of revenue. Low price environments lead to low investment levels, and therefore, less new supply to offset depletion. Eventually, available supply declines, leading to a tight supply and demand balance and higher prices. Over the past five years, we have seen a steady decline in conventional spending, which has been somewhat offset by North American unconventional growth. Pre-pandemic,, the industry was already investing at levels below historic rates and below what would be required to meet future demand and overcome natural depletion. All of this, based on recent estimates, from the International Energy Agency. The overall impact of the pandemic this year has been dramatic, significantly reducing current investment levels, which exacerbates the problem. On top of this, industry exploration continues at multi-decade lows. Meanwhile, underlying production decline of 5% to 6% per year continues relentlessly. Looking forward, if the industry is to meet credible third party estimates for energy demand, we will need to significantly increase investments. This is shown here with a range of third-party estimates for the required level of future investments. For the industry to fund at this level of investments, prices will have to rise. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jack.\nJack Williams: Thanks Andy. Moving to Slide 22. I'm going to extend the point Andy just made on crude prices to refining and chemical margins. This chart puts the current refining and chemical margins into the context of the last 20 years. Refining is a high cyclical industry with significant ups and downs. But today's net refining margins are below any low experienced in the prior 20 years. Demand for diesel and gasoline has recovered much faster than jet, which is still 45% below pre-COVID levels. The large differences in the demand recovery for the different transportation fuels, put significant pressure on refinery operations, with excess jet production having to be blended into other products, which has driven second quarter and third quarter net refinery margins negative and to record low levels. Chemical margins are also close to the bottom of cycle conditions. Although chemical demand has remained strong, particularly in the packaging and medical markets, the excess supply for major investments on the Gulf Coast in Asia continues to pressure margins. Industry's responding by shutting down capacity and refining and pushing out new investments in Chemicals. This is a typical response we've seen historically, as producer struggled to maintain operations in very challenging financial conditions. We expect this will continue until supply and demand come into balance and margins recover. So, in summary, we see a recovery on the horizon across each of our businesses. We believe it is less a matter of if, but more a matter of when. This uncertainty led to actions we've taken this year, which underpins our plans for 2021. As was mentioned on this call last quarter, we acted quickly and decisively earlier this year to the challenging economic environment while retaining flexibility and positioning the business for the recovery that will inevitably come. Looking to 2021, we're focused on continuing this year's progress. Despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID, our operations are delivering world-class performance. Our safety, and the reliability of our operations, have been at or close to record levels in all three of our businesses. We're committed to maintain this performance in 2021. In terms of cash OpEx, in April, we gave the organization a target to reduce operating expenses for the year by 15%. We're well on our way to delivering even larger reductions and will achieve further structural efficiencies next year. We reduced this year's CapEx plan by 30% to $23 billion and similar to OpEx, expect to finish the year below our reduction target. To achieve this, we took steps to delay or postponed projects in construction. We challenged our organization and partners to offset any value impact from these delays with additional execution efficiencies, and our project teams delivered. In 2021, we expect to drive CapEx lower than this year to between $16 billion and $19 billion. Portfolio high grading activities are continuing. Our current conditions are challenging. We're making progress and anticipate additional assets in the market over the next 12 months. And finally, there will be no change to our capital allocation priorities of investing in industry advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable dividend. The progress we've made this year gives us confidence as we head into 2021. The work done over the last couple of years to improve our organization and drive efficiencies paid off in responding to the pandemic. Let me cover this in a little more detail. A critical change has been the move, from an organization focused on our functions to an organization aligned along the value chain of our businesses. This reduced the senior leadership structure and associated overhead, while improving line of sight across the business and increasing efforts to drive higher value from our assets. The new organization is also giving us the opportunity for deeper structural efficiencies, which we began working on in the second half of last year. As the pandemic hit, we were well positioned to accelerate the implementation of these efficiencies in response to the significant deterioration of economic conditions. The structural changes include a significant reduction in the size of our workforce driven by increasing spans of control, high grading activities, accelerating the use of digital technologies and leveraging the lower activity levels. These workforce reductions have been developed on a country-by-country, business-by-business basis. As you are likely aware, we've recently made announcements in Australia, Europe and then here in the US this week. Overall, we anticipate a reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, of 15% by year-end 2022 versus 2019 staffing levels. The vast majority of these reductions are occurring in above field or above side organizations. Our operating organization are driving further cost reductions in areas such as maintenance and logistics and supply chain, while continuing their focus on delivering world-class safety, reliability and environmental performance. Our Global Projects organization, formed last year, continues to build on our industry-leading project execution competency. This organization is focused on prioritizing our project portfolio to maximize value while capturing efficiencies in the current market. A single corporate organization for project execution has been critical and leveraging the scale of the corporations investments and effectively working with the contractor community, our partners and host governments to efficiently reduce spend while preserving optionality and long-term value. Our projects organization is managing the industry's most attractive portfolio of projects. We continue to aggressively advance our highest value projects and maintain exploration activities in both Guyana and Brazil. We are also taking advantage of the more favorable cost environment to progress the Corpus Christi chemical project and deliver it ahead of schedule and under budget. We're efficiently pacing short cycle Permian developments and working with our partners to defer other Downstream Chemical and LNG projects. Importantly, we're not canceling any projects that are in execution or in the funding process. These remain attractive investments and while the value of these projects may be deferred, it will not be diminished. Let me now turn to our progress in Guyana. With the announcement of two discoveries on the Stabroek Block during the quarter, Yellowtail 2 and Redtail 1, recoverable resource estimate is now approaching 9 billion oil equivalent barrels, positioning it as the largest new conventional liquids play in the last decade. The Liza 2 project remains on schedule for 2022 start-up, the FPSO is under construction in Singapore, and the first offshore installation campaign is underway. Also in the quarter we sanctioned the Payara project, our third major deepwater development on the Stabroek Block. We anticipate first production in 2024 and we'll have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and a resource base of 600 million barrels of oil. The FPSO construction will follow Liza 2, utilizing many of the same contractors and fabrication yards. And we're building out the in-country community required to be successful over the long term. In total, there are now more than 2,000 Guyanese citizens supporting the project activities and more than 2,500 Guyanese companies registered with the projects center for local business development that is focused on building local business capacity. Turning to the Permian. Our focus in the Permian is on preserving value as we continue to pace our activity levels. We expect Permian production to total about 360,000 oil equivalent barrels per day this year, which is about a third, higher than last year and consistent with our plan despite a more than 35% reduction in CapEx spend and a 14,000 barrel per day, year-to-date reduction due to COVID related economic curtailments. Our team has done an exceptional job in driving down drilling and completion cost through improved performance and productivity. We're currently operating about 15 rigs as we head into next year and we expect further reductions stabilizing at around 10 to 12 rigs. We will obviously keep a close eye on the market and make necessary adjustments as the environment evolves. At this time, our expectation is that our development activity level will hold fairly steady in 2021. With current plans, next year's production is expected to average approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. At this time, I'll hand the call back over to Andy to talk about our portfolio prioritization.\nAndrew Swiger: Thanks. As Jack just highlighted, we have an attractive set of investment opportunities that is continuing to grow. But the constraints brought on by the pandemic, we are actively managing this portfolio of investments, with a focus on advancing our highest value projects. As our opportunity set grows and conditions evolve, we continue to reassess our investment portfolio and prioritize our spend. Each project must remain advantage versus industry, and competitive with our other opportunities. We work to ensure our assets remain a good strategic fit, provide material growth potential, and ultimately create differentiating value. This is a continuous process and an essential element of our annual planning process. It is particularly important this year as we work to develop plans within the constraints brought on by the pandemic. With the challenging price environment and our current debt levels, added emphasis is being placed on evaluating our entire portfolio for the potential of additional asset divestments. While continuing to progress our previously announced divestment program of $15 billion, we may expand it through a reevaluation of our North American dry gas assets, which are currently included in the corporation's long-term development plan. More specifically, we are evaluating the opportunity to bring the value of some of these assets forward by removing them from the development plan and marketing them through our divestment program. In total, the assets under consideration, have carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion, which could be at risk for impairment, depending on the candidates for divestment and the current estimate of their market value. We expect to complete the review as part of our planned process, which will be finalized with the board in November, and will be shared with all of you as part of future earnings calls and at our analyst meeting early next year. Given the importance of the current market conditions on our plans and decisions, I'd like to return to the price and margin environment and the earnings potential of the corporation. Historically, our three businesses, each significant in the industry, are typically a different points in their business cycles, which helps mitigate the impacts of their downcycles. In this unprecedented environment, all three businesses are simultaneously experiencing prices and margins below the 10 year range, significantly impacting the corporations earnings. We see the impact in the broader industry, with mounting losses, reduced investments and increased closures. And while questions remain around future demand recovery, one thing is certain, current conditions cannot continue. Supply and demand will eventually meet, prices and margins will respond. This suggests there is much more margin and price upside than downside going forward, and therefore, an expected increase in earnings. For perspective, the earnings range over the prior 10 year period has been between $2 billion and $8 billion per year in the Downstream, and between $1 billion and $5 billion per year in Chemical, far cry from where we are today. And while we may not see a return to average earnings in the near term, we should at least move to the bottom end of the historic range, which we see as the minimum levels demonstrated by a decade of industry experience. This is the basis upon which we are building next year's plan. If we see a recovery, just to the bottom of the 10 year range, and our Brent crude price in the range of credible third party estimates, we will be able to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt flat with second quarter levels. This morning, we've given you an overview of how we are navigating the challenging near-term market environment and discussed how market forces will restore supply and demand balances and improve the price and margin environment. The longer-term fundamentals remain robust, economies will recover, people's lives will improve, and the demand for energy will grow. In the short term, you've seen adjustments in our capital allocation, but our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged; investing at advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable and growing dividend. We're developing a 2021 plan consistent with the uncertainties and in line with the simultaneous low margins and prices in each of our businesses. Our CapEx will be further reduced to the range of $16 billion to $19 billion. We're further reducing our cash operating expense with a focus on overhead. We are looking to increase divestments and working to maintain the dividend, while holding gross debt at second quarter levels. Of course, we all recognize the uncertainty in today's market. We are keeping a close eye on developments and importantly on maintaining the flexibility to respond as conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn it back to Jack.\nJack Williams: Before we open up the lines for your questions, I want to reemphasize that we're pleased with the operational performance we've achieved. We're on track to better the spending targets we established earlier this year and we're positioning our portfolio for the future. And with that, I'll hand it back to Stephen to begin our Q&A session.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you and your comments Jack and Andy. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Swiger and Mr. Williams. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: So, on the capital program, you guys, basically already gave us a hint as to sort of the categories that you're committed to at close to pre-COVID levels and the ones that you see the most opportunity to stay back. So, I guess I'll just focus my first question on the Permian. How much capital reduction in 2021 was already built-in because you've completed a lot of your facilities and infrastructure spends by that point? And then, how much do you think is the reduction in activity from what was planned before the crisis? Thank you.\nAndrew Swiger: Yes. Thanks for the question, Sam. I mentioned earlier, we're at 15 rigs now, going down to about 10, and we think 10 to 12 rigs will be where we're going to be in '21. Of course, with an eye towards what the market does. That's substantially down from our earlier plans, where we were planning to continue to, more or less, stay at a rig level in the kind of 50 rig, 50 to 60 rig level in the Permian. Growth is substantially down. But look, I just want to just reinforce that the decision to reduce the spin due to the cash flow constraints is not at all a reflection of our development results, it's quite to the contrary. We're very pleased with how things are going. I mentioned the efficiency improvement that we've seen. We're continuing to gain experience with the cube developments and confirming those are a lot of value in that approach. So, we're very confident in the quality of the resource, including the unique development plan we have in the Delaware Basin, and then also the logistics integration we had at the Gulf Coast. So, we really like what we're seeing out there. We're just going to curtail activity because we have the discretion to do so and defer and move some of that capital to other opportunities.\nSam Margolin: And I think I have a follow-up, and I think it's for Andy, and it's about asset sales. A lot of your businesses are organized in JVs and equity affiliates and from the perspective of a Stock Analyst that usually doesn't mean anything. But right now, the dividend at Exxon's level is stressed, just given the environment. And that's a problem because it doesn't always align with the capital priorities of affiliates. So, instead of thinking about disposals by\nSam Margolin: Asset category or segment, does it make sense to think about them from the perspective of asset class and maybe affiliate positions? And JVs are a logical place to look for disposals, because at the very least, you sort of align production with your cash - your uses of cash priorities?\nJack Williams: Sam, thanks for the question. Our review for divestment candidates is quite comprehensive and it looks across every sort of different way you can cut the business. In terms of what we think is no longer a strategic fit, it's all the criteria for divestment, regardless of whether it's in a JV, an equity company, or a more conventional type of arrangements there. So, as we go through this and it's a process of continual renewal and review, we don't really find this sort of categories that you have suggested as being, as representing any sort of a barrier to analysis. There may be some friction depending on agreements in some of these arrangements and so forth, but by and large with how it's existed, we've worked with the operator or the other partners to reach a resolution and be able to put the right assets into the market at the right time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nAndrew Swiger: Good morning, Devin.\nOperator: Devin, your line might be muted. Okay. We'll move on to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Andy, I want to come back to Slide 29 where you were talking about the dividend coverage potential in 2021. If I look at the oil price, you're implying for the third quarter, being at the low end of historic range around $40 oil, and then you assumed recovery in refining margins there. I think the 2021 would imply the $2 billion of the $2.8 billion recovery there to get back to the low end, if I understood that correctly. So, I guess, are you trying to imply that you think you can, if you get a little bit of recovery in refining, that you can cover your dividend in the low 40s organically?\nAndrew Swiger: I think, let me - and this is a really important point and I think the question that's on a lot of people's mind. So, I'd like to take a little bit of time to go back through and really cover the way we're thinking about this. From an overall messaging point, our objective is to maintain the dividend, advance the highest value investments, and maintain the debt at a cost competitive limit. With prices at the low end at the historical ranges, looking at those bars there at the low end of those historical ranges, the plans we're working on to accomplish this, that will accomplish this, why is that? Because of the actions we've taken; the OpEx reduction, the workforce reduction, capital reduction to a level optimized to preserve long-term value, yet at a level that preserves flexibility and access to debt markets. And prices and margins, as we've said, are at a historic lows across all three businesses. That's obviously not where we are today when you look at those diamonds. But if you look at the mounting losses across the industry, the reduced investments we're seeing, the rationalizations, the project cancellations, the deferrals, it's clear to us that we're going to see an improvement in the industry. Our base plan conservatively assumes a gradual economic recovery and modest prices, not unlike our past plans and consistent with third-party ranges, including the oil price, which you asked about. It's really hard to predict the pace and a path to recovery for each of the businesses, and they do offset to some extent as we've talked about here. As an example, our gas business is currently running ahead of our assumptions. Refining is also up, as you point out, from the third quarter lows. We have built some contingency into our plans and believe we have enough to accommodate the uncertainty. But as I said, we keep a close eye on weather developments.\nPhil Gresh: I guess, maybe to clarify before my second question, are you implying any amount of asset sale proceeds in your ability to maintain the dividend without increase in gross debt in 2021?\nAndrew Swiger: The plans have a modest amount of asset sales in there. As I said, we have a lot in the market. We are in active discussions. We have bids coming in. And again, as I also talked about, we're looking at the plans and finalizing the plans of potentially putting even more into the market. So, there is a modest level of asset sales in those plans.\nJack Williams: That's not just - also the Downstream as well.\nAndrew Swiger: Across the businesses.\nPhil Gresh: Right. Okay. And do you have a broader view on 2021 production overall? Obviously, you said the Permian is going to grow, but at this level of capital spending, $16 billion to $19 billion, how does that correlate to what production could look like more broadly?\nStephen Littleton: Yes. Phil, as you can imagine, it's pretty difficult to get a good grasp on what production is going to do in 2021 with all the curtailments and we're surely not going to get out in front and try to predict what OpEx is going to do, and we're producing in several of the country. So, there's a lot of - there's a wide band of uncertainty, but broadly speaking, we would see production staying around - about flat year-on-year.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: My first question is just continuing on with the balance sheet and dividend line of questions and I don't mean to keep hitting on it, but I think it is important for the market and investors. So, we appreciate all the details on '21. There is still some uncertainty about Exxon not intending to take on the additional debt, but can you just clarify that if in the event that realized prices and margins are lower than your expectation, can you just clarify whether you would take on additional debt in order to fund high return projects along with the dividend? Or is your comment intended to signal that the company does not intend to take on any additional debt, period?\nAndrew Swiger: Jeanine, thanks for the question. As we've said in the past, we really want to ensure that we remain competitive access - cost competitive access to debt. Why is that? We do have refinancing needs going forward in the future as term debt matures. But we also want to maintain a level of balance sheet flexibility. We believe that going above the $70 billion level, that second quarter level, is going to impact those objectives. Again, when we think about what might happen in the future, lot of hypotheticals there. Our plans comprehend a bunch of uncertainty. We do need to get back to the bottom of cycle type conditions. This is not a cycle. The pandemic is out with cycle experience there in order to be able to continue to move forward in a way that we've talked about. But I would say that if things go along the way they are, if they were to persist this way, and we don't think they will, because the energies can't survive. And there's going to be a lot of measures being taken by a lot of people's to react to the situation.\nJeanine Wai: My second question is, maybe just looking out to the medium and longer term and sustaining capital. Last quarter you identified Downstream and Chemical sustaining capital as about $2 billion to $4 billion collectively on the Upstream side, how does the second half '20 run rate's been compared to what would be considered necessary to maintain productive capacity over the longer term? We know that you're spending some money in the back half of this year on several longer term, medium term project growth like Guyana and Tengiz, for example, but will those projects that you're spending on now, will they contribute at a level that's necessary to offset declines elsewhere in the portfolio down the line? Thank you.\nJack Williams: Thanks, Jeanine. Let me take that one. As we think about where we're spending our money this year, our CapEx this year and where we'll likely be spending in next year, you mentioned Tengiz and Guyana, the Corpus cracker is another one, Bacalhau in Brazil is another one. And then, we're continuing on with the Golden Pass development as well. And then, we already talked about the Permian. So, those are kind of the headline large major projects that are attracting capital today and likely will be next year. And then, there is a modest amount of, in all three businesses, that were spending at kind of a local level, the plant level, the local field level, that it's kind of in the low single digits of billions of dollars. So, that's kind of where we are standing right now. And as I mentioned, that's - we think production's largely going to be fairly flat next year. And then, that's without really much contribution from any of these projects I just talked about. So we - as we look forward, obviously, the rate at which we'll look at potentially growing our CapEx is going to be dependent on how the market evolves but we do see growing it over time. We see growing it at a more moderate pace. Retention that we talked about before, again, depending on where we see the market. But we feel that the level we've given for 2021, provides sufficient capital to progress the big developments that we want to, these really industry leading developments that are ongoing, and still maintaining a modest amount of activity, kind of in the base that as you said offsets decline.\nOperator: We'll go back to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: So, I wanted to ask on the earnings potential across from your different business units. In the deck, you have a very helpful Slide 29. You talked about in your prepared remarks as well, the contextualize is what we're seeing right now relative to history. When you think about those different buckets, two areas we've started to see a recovery, back into the 10 year ranges would be Chemicals and natural gas. The first question I have is on the Chemical side. And we think about what differentiates Exxon's portfolio versus a lot of peers historically, you have this large, very profitable high return Chemicals business, and it was historically a big cash flow generator. And since we last had strong industry margins, there has been some expansions and improvements across that business. And it's kind of hard from our seat to really drive the difference between moves in some of the benchmark margins and underlying profitability and cash flow in the business. And my question is, given what's changed in that portfolio, to the extent that we see a recovery in Chemicals margins back into those historical ranges or something, in my opinion, that we saw in 2017 or 2018. Are there material differences in the business now that will drive cash flow and earnings higher or lower as we look out over the next few years?\nJack Williams: Thanks, Deven. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about the Chemicals business a little bit. If you look at why we're doing this as well as we are this year in Chemicals, it's really this polyethylene weighting we have. It's holding up very well in this kind of COVID environment we're in, as well as some reductions in operating expenses. That's across all the businesses, including chemicals, and that's certainly providing a tailwind. We're also running very reliably this year. I referred to that earlier and that has benefited us because others have had difficulties. And so, we've really benefited from that good strong performance. And then, the other kind of unique part of our Chemicals business is this integration with the Downstream. And that has benefited both the Downstream and Chemicals this year as we've been able to really nimbly, kind of, optimize the feedstocks that we've been moving into our crackers. And sometimes cracking some distressed refining streams. Then moving between chemicals and gas a bit as those as those feedstock prices have moved around. So, having a really good year this year in the Chemicals business, and it's certainly helping us get to this environment. As you look forward, I mentioned the Corpus cracker that will be coming online at the end of 2021. That's certainly going to be helpful as we look going into the next cycle. And then, we have these other projects that are paused, but certainly not canceled; the polypropylene expansions and then especially Chemical expansions, Baytown. And then, further out, we're still looking at the opportunity to add a cracker in China. So, we are adding - we are looking at investments today - going forward on investments today and we'll be substantially adding the Chemicals earnings capacity and cash flow capacity going forward. But as we get into the that next, kind of, top of cycle conditions, I would expect us to be at or above, quite frankly above, where we've been back in the 2016-2017 time period.\nDevin McDermott: That makes a lot of sense and very helpful color. The second question I have, and it's on the other color we've seen, a sharper recovery here is on the natural gas side, and some comments on the call about the potential divestiture of the North America or US had dry gas assets, that the bigger recovery here, I think that we've seen is in global LNG, moving pretty sharply off of balloons in terms of what the prices have turned it over the past few months. Some of the deferrals and capital also push out some of the LNG projects, I think that you had previously in the plan. I was just wondering if you could address the role of natural gas in LNG specifically to have in your portfolio going forward. And your views, if you think you have some on the sustainability of some of this stronger pricing that we're seeing right now globally for natural gas?\nAndrew Swiger: Hi, Devin. Thanks for the question. It's obviously, the phenomenon, if I look just first at North America, I know your question's on LNG, is driven by people looking at supply and demand balance as related to the relative under investment that's been going on there for a while. That's important. Because it's also in the long term when you think about LNG. That will come into play down the road as well. North America is an important source of LNG supply these days. But the concept of under investment leading to supply and demand issues in the long term is also fundamental with the LNG business as well. We have seen a good business continuing to go forward in LNG. A lot of the businesses are still unrelated to our linkages with crude price, index prices to crude and so forth, so it's rebounded. It is rebounding with the crude price run up in the third quarter there. That's a good thing. I think as the world resumes economic growth, you're going to continue to see the LNG business grow very strongly, probably above GDP as it was before. There is no reason not to believe that's going to happen, as it works its way into more power generation around the world, industrial applications, so forth. And to the extent that there is a hiatus in LNG investment. We are deferring some of our projects with a short term time, probably underpins a continuing strong fundamental future for that business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Rigby with UBS.\nJon Rigby: Two related questions. The first one specifically, and you referenced a couple of times is your ability to, you just down halt projects but maintain value, sort of, classically that's never been the case, where you can you start to demobilize people and contractors, within time remobilize them again, that's a classic way of getting cost overrun. So, I just wondered, specifically whether you could just go through how you are addressing that? I think it will be intrinsically interesting. And secondly, just sort of topic related to that. I think Darren said in the first quarter that it was the three legs stood for with the balance sheet, the CapEx and the dividend. And you made the point, I think rightly, that CapEx pays for future dividend. So, at what point, are we going to see flex in the balance sheet? We discussed that we can make our own assessment about the dividend, but we can't so much, in terms of, along the wavelength of value creation that supports the longer term planning of the business. So, how much more flex have you got to keep pushing out what - you've made the point in multiple meetings during the March after market a very good project, how much flex have you got to keep pushing those projects out? Thanks.\nJack Williams: Okay. John. That's a bit of a mouthful there. So, let me take the first piece on the projects and then I'll let Andy address that second question you had. On the projects and the ability to defer and take pause in some of these projects and not reduce the value - let me just talk about the Global Projects organization and the value that organization brings. As I mentioned earlier, kind of a single face to the contractor community, I think this organization is increasingly unique in industry. A lot of project management expertise and experience in this organization. And we are going to be, as we are continuing to look at the workforce, making sure we're keeping that competency, because we think it's very important for our fundamental competitive advantages we have going forward. So, we really leaned on that organization hard as to how we can manage through this period, pause some of these projects, and as I mentioned earlier, retaining the value. And so, a lot of this is, number one, leveraging a different environment. We have a much different supply demand environment on the Gulf Coast today than we had last year, much different, down something like 20%. That creates a different competitive dynamic and those labor costs are coming down. And we are able to leverage that, not only for the paused projects, but for projects we're continuing to execute with negotiating with those rates, what appropriate rates would be. So, we had a bit of a, kind of a stress situation in the Gulf Coast that has eased considerably, and that has helped us with cost. The other thing we're doing is we're pausing these projects as we're looking at the scopes of projects, and making sure, it gives us extra time to go through and scrub those and make sure they are absolutely fit for purpose and that we can - they're absolutely minimum kits. So, like, for instance, I mentioned before that we had taken a pause on the projects in Fawley in the UK. And there is on where we looked at the scope and we decided we could remove one tank from the scope, and that reduced cost. So, things like that that we're looking at the scopes. And then, the other thing is, in these paused times, we're able to completely finish engineering. And so, go out into the field, restart and have complete engineering done, and really have efficient execution once we get back to construction. So, the organization worked at it very hard, took a lot of time, and made sure for every single project, what scope to do and want to finish, when is the right time to restart, what work are we going to do to leave the project in a good shape, what are we going to do in the meantime before we restart, and line all that out. And when you add all that up, we're able to preserve all the value. And with that, I am going to hand over to Andy for the second part of the question.\nAndrew Swiger: Sure. Hi, the three-legged story you referred to that Darren talked about, I mean that is our capital allocation priorities; investing in advantage projects, to maintaining a strong balance sheet, and then paying the reliable and growing dividend. The CapEx piece of it is fundamentally important because as you quite rightly reflect, the CapEx we spend now is what those investments in America, what pay are the future dividends. We worked very hard on the 2020 and the 2021 CapEx levels, to get them to the point where we're maintaining progress on just the highest priority investments we're pausing, and deferring the remainder. And as Jack just pointed out, were doing that very carefully to ensure that we're preserving the bag and all that. For the programs that we've talked about in 2020 and 2021, that 2020 were in the range of $16 billion to $19 billion, that is about, in our judgment, that's the level that we think is the right one there. Obviously, as I said, we've maintained a little bit of contingency. There's a little bit of flex and all that. But that's really the level that we have judged to be the right one to balance getting through this crisis we're in. Now the pandemic, this way below the bottom of the cycle type thing. Preserve those opportunities and then be able to start moving the CapEx up in the outer years as the conditions in the world improve. As we have said they certainly must, given where industry is right now.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: I guess the first question, there's been a lot certainly that you guys have talked about and that's been written about, carbon, and a lot of your peers who have come out with explicit carbon targets, I just wanted to know where Exxon is in that journey in terms of coming out with carbon targets and how are you thinking about setting them to the extent that's the path you choose to go down?\nJack Williams: Yes. Thanks, Niel. Let me just take a step back a little bit on how we see things and what we're doing. Basically, we see a world that's going to need more energy going forward; through population, through GDP growth, and a lot of that goes through the non-OECD countries. Energy consumption is tied to the population and GDP. And we don't think the current solutions set is really complete. We think we need more solutions there. And as you think about the size and the complexity of the infrastructure we have today, it's going to take some time to change that. So, to get to your specific question, near-term, what are we focusing on? We're focusing on mitigating our emissions operations and with that we have a commitment to reduce our carbon intensity over time. And that's what we're working on. And so, we kind of release that through our carbon and energy summary every year, how we're doing in that regard in terms of absolute carbon emissions and also the intensity, and that's kind of where we're focused. If you think about all the assets that we had - that we're producing back in, I think 2005, if you look at those today, we've had a significant reduction of those assets. Now, we've brought some new assets on but those reductions in the base through things like Cogen and energy efficiency, have been able to offset the emissions of the new assets we brought on. And then, longer term, we really think we need to be focusing on these high emissions sectors, PowerGen, commercial transportation, and industrial where the technologies are just insufficient to drive deep emission reductions and that's where we're looking for breakthrough technologies. I don't know, Andy, if you want to talk a little bit about the work we're doing there. And that's where we think we can uniquely contribute to society in terms of mitigating the risk of climate change.\nAndrew Swiger: Yes, Jack. You're absolutely right. The world does not have the complete solutions to get to where we need to meet that dual challenge of meeting the needs associated with economic growth while reducing emissions. Our focus is on, as Jack said, what we can do on our own operations, the targets set there, very much on the technology to fill those solution sets. And we talked a little bit about our nature and call. We talked about the Global Thermostat, the arrangement that we have a Director [indiscernible] front Stephen mentioned that. And you've seen other ones from time to time there. But we have a large research program ongoing in these sectors. We talked about algae in the past. We've talked about carbon capture and sequestration in general many times. These are the things that the world is going to need and these are the things that we have a unique capability in many cases. To take a lot of the ideas that are out there in society that people come to us and others with, and lack the specific capabilities or capacities to make the advancements in things like material sciences to improve something, to improve a particular catalyst that might be unnecessary. And they certainly lag the broad experience of process engineering that we have that is necessary to bring some of these technologies to scale. There are many things in flight there, but a lot of it is R&D. And I think in a world that is impatient for solutions. It's very hard to be patient to allow the R&D to happen, but we are, and we have that kind of posture towards it. And we certainly hope to be able to talk more and more about that in the coming years.\nStephen Littleton: Andy, if you don't mind, I'd probably have to give a little bit of perspective of the progress we've made since our targets that we set back in 2018. When we said we were going to reduce our methane emissions by about 15% and flaring by 25%. And Neil, I can tell you we're clearly on target to not only achieve that but exceed those targets. So, it is a focus area and it's something that we take very seriously.\nNeil Mehta: And then, Stephen, around carbon specifically, has that - for many investors is a prerequisite, in a world where ESG is an important part of investing?\nStephen Littleton: Agree.\nNeil Mehta: And then the follow-up question here is around refining. This question is for you, Jack. As you look at the next couple of years, recognizing demand is very uncertain, how do you see the refining landscape playing out? Do you see the market as being structurally oversupplied with tight crude differentials or do you actually see a path where capacity retirements can help to normalized margin over time?\nJack Williams: I think both of those. I agree with both of those statements. The industry is currently oversupplied and rationalizations will - we'll work that over time. Since the start of the pandemic, we've already had a million barrels a day of announced refining closures. So, again, as I mentioned earlier the refining industry is under stress. And as you look to some low to medium conversion refineries, especially those that are not in good geographical locations where you have a growing demand, they're all under water. And so, we've already had some closures. I expect there will likely be more. And the deeper, the longer we stay in this sort of environment, the more announcements will come out. So, yes, I do think we're oversupplied right now and the market will take care of that through these closures.\nOperator: We'll next go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Andy and Jack, thanks for both of you guys getting on the call and letting it run a little long. I appreciate you getting me on. Andy, I'm going to sound a little bit on the dividend. I'd like to pre-phase my question like this, if the market is not prepared to pay for the recovery that you're laying out, which it clearly isn't, given where your stock is trading. Every time you pay a dividend that you can't afford, you're transferring value from equity to debt or basically your share price is going down. And that's basically what's happening right now. So, if the market is not paying you for that dividend despite the 60 plus years that you've paid this dividend, why would you continue to do that? And I'm curious what the view of the Board and the credit agencies are on this issue. And I guess the bottom line is what conditions would it take for you to say, you know what, we're not getting paid for this dividend, let's just cut and run and use the cash to preserve equity value?\nAndrew Swiger: Doug, this is something that we have thought long and hard about. We've discussed with our Board every quarter when we make the dividend discussion. But I'll tell you, we fully understand the importance of the dividend to our shareholders. It's very important to them and we're very thoughtful on that. What we've done is said to ourselves, let's look and see, and balancing in capital allocation and balancing with how we see with the likelihood the world evolving. What the right plan is to be able to meet our shareholders needs, interest in the dividend, at the same time moving the business forward there. So, we've constructed a plan that based on the things what we see happening in the market. The calibrations of what the business is doing, balance all of those sort of things and retain a little bit of flexibility as it goes forward. Now, as we talked about before, we do see ourselves moving back to bottom of the cycle conditions because the industry simply cannot continue on at these levels here, and in that plan, we will be able to maintain the dividend. We get into some situation where we're back in a world like we've been in the second and third quarters, obviously, all bets are off. And I think that's true across the industry. But we also don't think that's sustainable. So, that's really the rationale behind it and that's the way we've talked about it with the board and that's where we talk about it with outside agencies, that's where we talk about with our general investor class when we have those discussions.\nDoug Leggate: Sorry, Andy, to push you on this. What conditions would you see then, how long with this have to go on for you to say we can't do this any longer?\nAndrew Swiger: Doug, as I said we put the plan together for 2021 based on our best assessment of the market. It has some contingency on it, some flexibility on it, but were we to run out of that contingency, obviously we'd have to look to pull the next lever.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you for that. Can I do my quick follow-up? It's really just about visibility on the disposal front. You talked about $15 billion. You haven't done a whole heck of a lot yet. So, I'm just curious if you can give us any visibility or line of sight as to what you think is a realistic maturation of that disposal plan over the next 12 months? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nJack Williams: Yes. Thanks, Doug. I'll take a shot at that one. We have quite a bit out in the market right now. We talked about, I think 11 out in the market. We're in fairly advanced discussions on a few of these assets. So, we do think that they're going to have some impact in '21 and '22. As you mentioned, it's a pretty difficult market on asset divestment. We're going to make sure we get value. We have something above our attention value. We are going to be patient. As Andy said, there is very little reliance on that in terms of where we see things in 2021, but we're going to continue to have productive discussions with prospective buyers. And we are seeing good interest. There is no question, we're seeing good interest. These will make some buyers within their portfolio is pretty nicely. So, we're going to continue on, Doug, in that regard. And again, just stick to the fact that we're going to make sure we get value. The assets, we'll keep them in our portfolio.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks very much.\nAndrew Swiger: Operator, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take that last question from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Thanks for squeezing me in and taking time on the call. I'll just leave it at, or actually my first was on just - the cost reductions really haven't been touched upon that much. And you kind of said you're on path to exceed 15% cost reductions, maybe achieve something close to 20%, but it's still unclear what the structural amount of those reductions are versus what's related to lower activity. So, can you just kind of talk a little bit about the dividend buckets, those cost reductions fall into? And I have a follow-up.\nJack Williams: Okay, Jason. Yes, I think, clearly, if you look back in March and April, we're talking about these reduction targets, really, a good bit of that was activity reduction. As we were sparing capacity and refineries and we were curtailing production activity in some of Upstream areas as we were having less chemical demand for the first month or two. And the idea was okay, we're going to certainly make sure we capture all the OpEx reductions in those areas. But also recognizing - and quite frankly, coming into the year, we were already working on the structural efficiencies. Some of that culminated in the workforce announcement that we made earlier and that I reiterated in the prepared presentation. But those efficiencies have been brought about by the reorganization of the businesses along these value chains versus the functions. And it just freed up a lot of capacity in terms of our ability to really get line of sight to the assets and to really up, be able to operate more efficiently, take away some friction, take away from what we call doing business with ourselves, and that kind of thing. As I mentioned before, often in presentations, leveraging digital technologies to where we can, we're more flexible in where we do work and making sure we're doing that in the most cost effective way. So, clearly, initially, there was a lot of reduction based on activity and those are being replaced with structural efficiencies as we move forward and those will play out, not just in 2021 but in 2022 going forward.\nJason Gabelman: Is there a magnitude or a number you could put on those structural efficiencies?\nAndrew Swiger: I'm not really in position to give you a number on that.\nJason Gabelman: And then, my second question is just kind of tying two things that have been mentioned on today's call, that global decarbonization effort and then global refining overcapacity. It seems like the push to decarbonize is focused in advanced economies in areas where you are heavily concentrated [indiscernible] of your refining footprint. So, do those two things kind of - the fact that OECD economies are pushing to decarbonize most of the energy growth that's happening in non-OECD, and your footprint for refining is predominantly in OECD countries. Do those teams frame how you think about your refining footprint going forward? The subtext being there could be more pressure in your legacy refining geographies than some other places we're seeing underlying demand growth? Thanks.\nJack Williams: Yes, Jason. That's a good question. It's certainly plays a role. But as we look at our refining circuit and think about that going forward, we are fortunate that we had some highly complex refineries that very importantly are integrated with chemicals. That Chemicals integration is probably the overlying factor that we look at in terms of asset refiners that we think long-term are going to be very competitive. But we are looking, I think I've showed you before, this net cash margin for all refineries around the world, and the fact that we need to be on the left hand side of that with all our refineries. So, we've invested. We've made some investments in some of those; Antwerp, Rotterdam, Beaumont being some examples, Singapore, that we're going to make substantial moves to look to the left. And those are the refineries we think long term are going to be competitive in long term, but belong in the portfolio. So, we're making that call between ones we're going to invest. The ones that are already there are highly integrated refineries in the Gulf Coast, Baytown, Baton Rouge, and increasingly, Beaumont. And then, those that we're pushing in that direction with some good strategic investments to kind of shore up some of the conversion capacity gaps we've had. But clearly, as you look at kind of a medium, low complexity refineries, in an OECD country, that's not integrated with Chemicals, yeah, those are going to be a challenge going forward and that certainly plays into our thinking.\nStephen Littleton: All right, thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you thought on us, the opportunity to highlight third quarter results. We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, and please be safe.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jack Williams",
            "content": "Thanks Andy. Moving to Slide 22. I'm going to extend the point Andy just made on crude prices to refining and chemical margins. This chart puts the current refining and chemical margins into the context of the last 20 years. Refining is a high cyclical industry with significant ups and downs. But today's net refining margins are below any low experienced in the prior 20 years. Demand for diesel and gasoline has recovered much faster than jet, which is still 45% below pre-COVID levels. The large differences in the demand recovery for the different transportation fuels, put significant pressure on refinery operations, with excess jet production having to be blended into other products, which has driven second quarter and third quarter net refinery margins negative and to record low levels. Chemical margins are also close to the bottom of cycle conditions. Although chemical demand has remained strong, particularly in the packaging and medical markets, the excess supply for major investments on the Gulf Coast in Asia continues to pressure margins. Industry's responding by shutting down capacity and refining and pushing out new investments in Chemicals. This is a typical response we've seen historically, as producer struggled to maintain operations in very challenging financial conditions. We expect this will continue until supply and demand come into balance and margins recover. So, in summary, we see a recovery on the horizon across each of our businesses. We believe it is less a matter of if, but more a matter of when. This uncertainty led to actions we've taken this year, which underpins our plans for 2021. As was mentioned on this call last quarter, we acted quickly and decisively earlier this year to the challenging economic environment while retaining flexibility and positioning the business for the recovery that will inevitably come. Looking to 2021, we're focused on continuing this year's progress. Despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID, our operations are delivering world-class performance. Our safety, and the reliability of our operations, have been at or close to record levels in all three of our businesses. We're committed to maintain this performance in 2021. In terms of cash OpEx, in April, we gave the organization a target to reduce operating expenses for the year by 15%. We're well on our way to delivering even larger reductions and will achieve further structural efficiencies next year. We reduced this year's CapEx plan by 30% to $23 billion and similar to OpEx, expect to finish the year below our reduction target. To achieve this, we took steps to delay or postponed projects in construction. We challenged our organization and partners to offset any value impact from these delays with additional execution efficiencies, and our project teams delivered. In 2021, we expect to drive CapEx lower than this year to between $16 billion and $19 billion. Portfolio high grading activities are continuing. Our current conditions are challenging. We're making progress and anticipate additional assets in the market over the next 12 months. And finally, there will be no change to our capital allocation priorities of investing in industry advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable dividend. The progress we've made this year gives us confidence as we head into 2021. The work done over the last couple of years to improve our organization and drive efficiencies paid off in responding to the pandemic. Let me cover this in a little more detail. A critical change has been the move, from an organization focused on our functions to an organization aligned along the value chain of our businesses. This reduced the senior leadership structure and associated overhead, while improving line of sight across the business and increasing efforts to drive higher value from our assets. The new organization is also giving us the opportunity for deeper structural efficiencies, which we began working on in the second half of last year. As the pandemic hit, we were well positioned to accelerate the implementation of these efficiencies in response to the significant deterioration of economic conditions. The structural changes include a significant reduction in the size of our workforce driven by increasing spans of control, high grading activities, accelerating the use of digital technologies and leveraging the lower activity levels. These workforce reductions have been developed on a country-by-country, business-by-business basis. As you are likely aware, we've recently made announcements in Australia, Europe and then here in the US this week. Overall, we anticipate a reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, of 15% by year-end 2022 versus 2019 staffing levels. The vast majority of these reductions are occurring in above field or above side organizations. Our operating organization are driving further cost reductions in areas such as maintenance and logistics and supply chain, while continuing their focus on delivering world-class safety, reliability and environmental performance. Our Global Projects organization, formed last year, continues to build on our industry-leading project execution competency. This organization is focused on prioritizing our project portfolio to maximize value while capturing efficiencies in the current market. A single corporate organization for project execution has been critical and leveraging the scale of the corporations investments and effectively working with the contractor community, our partners and host governments to efficiently reduce spend while preserving optionality and long-term value. Our projects organization is managing the industry's most attractive portfolio of projects. We continue to aggressively advance our highest value projects and maintain exploration activities in both Guyana and Brazil. We are also taking advantage of the more favorable cost environment to progress the Corpus Christi chemical project and deliver it ahead of schedule and under budget. We're efficiently pacing short cycle Permian developments and working with our partners to defer other Downstream Chemical and LNG projects. Importantly, we're not canceling any projects that are in execution or in the funding process. These remain attractive investments and while the value of these projects may be deferred, it will not be diminished. Let me now turn to our progress in Guyana. With the announcement of two discoveries on the Stabroek Block during the quarter, Yellowtail 2 and Redtail 1, recoverable resource estimate is now approaching 9 billion oil equivalent barrels, positioning it as the largest new conventional liquids play in the last decade. The Liza 2 project remains on schedule for 2022 start-up, the FPSO is under construction in Singapore, and the first offshore installation campaign is underway. Also in the quarter we sanctioned the Payara project, our third major deepwater development on the Stabroek Block. We anticipate first production in 2024 and we'll have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and a resource base of 600 million barrels of oil. The FPSO construction will follow Liza 2, utilizing many of the same contractors and fabrication yards. And we're building out the in-country community required to be successful over the long term. In total, there are now more than 2,000 Guyanese citizens supporting the project activities and more than 2,500 Guyanese companies registered with the projects center for local business development that is focused on building local business capacity. Turning to the Permian. Our focus in the Permian is on preserving value as we continue to pace our activity levels. We expect Permian production to total about 360,000 oil equivalent barrels per day this year, which is about a third, higher than last year and consistent with our plan despite a more than 35% reduction in CapEx spend and a 14,000 barrel per day, year-to-date reduction due to COVID related economic curtailments. Our team has done an exceptional job in driving down drilling and completion cost through improved performance and productivity. We're currently operating about 15 rigs as we head into next year and we expect further reductions stabilizing at around 10 to 12 rigs. We will obviously keep a close eye on the market and make necessary adjustments as the environment evolves. At this time, our expectation is that our development activity level will hold fairly steady in 2021. With current plans, next year's production is expected to average approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. At this time, I'll hand the call back over to Andy to talk about our portfolio prioritization. Before we open up the lines for your questions, I want to reemphasize that we're pleased with the operational performance we've achieved. We're on track to better the spending targets we established earlier this year and we're positioning our portfolio for the future. And with that, I'll hand it back to Stephen to begin our Q&A session. Sam, thanks for the question. Our review for divestment candidates is quite comprehensive and it looks across every sort of different way you can cut the business. In terms of what we think is no longer a strategic fit, it's all the criteria for divestment, regardless of whether it's in a JV, an equity company, or a more conventional type of arrangements there. So, as we go through this and it's a process of continual renewal and review, we don't really find this sort of categories that you have suggested as being, as representing any sort of a barrier to analysis. There may be some friction depending on agreements in some of these arrangements and so forth, but by and large with how it's existed, we've worked with the operator or the other partners to reach a resolution and be able to put the right assets into the market at the right time. That's not just - also the Downstream as well. Thanks, Jeanine. Let me take that one. As we think about where we're spending our money this year, our CapEx this year and where we'll likely be spending in next year, you mentioned Tengiz and Guyana, the Corpus cracker is another one, Bacalhau in Brazil is another one. And then, we're continuing on with the Golden Pass development as well. And then, we already talked about the Permian. So, those are kind of the headline large major projects that are attracting capital today and likely will be next year. And then, there is a modest amount of, in all three businesses, that were spending at kind of a local level, the plant level, the local field level, that it's kind of in the low single digits of billions of dollars. So, that's kind of where we are standing right now. And as I mentioned, that's - we think production's largely going to be fairly flat next year. And then, that's without really much contribution from any of these projects I just talked about. So we - as we look forward, obviously, the rate at which we'll look at potentially growing our CapEx is going to be dependent on how the market evolves but we do see growing it over time. We see growing it at a more moderate pace. Retention that we talked about before, again, depending on where we see the market. But we feel that the level we've given for 2021, provides sufficient capital to progress the big developments that we want to, these really industry leading developments that are ongoing, and still maintaining a modest amount of activity, kind of in the base that as you said offsets decline. Thanks, Deven. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about the Chemicals business a little bit. If you look at why we're doing this as well as we are this year in Chemicals, it's really this polyethylene weighting we have. It's holding up very well in this kind of COVID environment we're in, as well as some reductions in operating expenses. That's across all the businesses, including chemicals, and that's certainly providing a tailwind. We're also running very reliably this year. I referred to that earlier and that has benefited us because others have had difficulties. And so, we've really benefited from that good strong performance. And then, the other kind of unique part of our Chemicals business is this integration with the Downstream. And that has benefited both the Downstream and Chemicals this year as we've been able to really nimbly, kind of, optimize the feedstocks that we've been moving into our crackers. And sometimes cracking some distressed refining streams. Then moving between chemicals and gas a bit as those as those feedstock prices have moved around. So, having a really good year this year in the Chemicals business, and it's certainly helping us get to this environment. As you look forward, I mentioned the Corpus cracker that will be coming online at the end of 2021. That's certainly going to be helpful as we look going into the next cycle. And then, we have these other projects that are paused, but certainly not canceled; the polypropylene expansions and then especially Chemical expansions, Baytown. And then, further out, we're still looking at the opportunity to add a cracker in China. So, we are adding - we are looking at investments today - going forward on investments today and we'll be substantially adding the Chemicals earnings capacity and cash flow capacity going forward. But as we get into the that next, kind of, top of cycle conditions, I would expect us to be at or above, quite frankly above, where we've been back in the 2016-2017 time period. Okay. John. That's a bit of a mouthful there. So, let me take the first piece on the projects and then I'll let Andy address that second question you had. On the projects and the ability to defer and take pause in some of these projects and not reduce the value - let me just talk about the Global Projects organization and the value that organization brings. As I mentioned earlier, kind of a single face to the contractor community, I think this organization is increasingly unique in industry. A lot of project management expertise and experience in this organization. And we are going to be, as we are continuing to look at the workforce, making sure we're keeping that competency, because we think it's very important for our fundamental competitive advantages we have going forward. So, we really leaned on that organization hard as to how we can manage through this period, pause some of these projects, and as I mentioned earlier, retaining the value. And so, a lot of this is, number one, leveraging a different environment. We have a much different supply demand environment on the Gulf Coast today than we had last year, much different, down something like 20%. That creates a different competitive dynamic and those labor costs are coming down. And we are able to leverage that, not only for the paused projects, but for projects we're continuing to execute with negotiating with those rates, what appropriate rates would be. So, we had a bit of a, kind of a stress situation in the Gulf Coast that has eased considerably, and that has helped us with cost. The other thing we're doing is we're pausing these projects as we're looking at the scopes of projects, and making sure, it gives us extra time to go through and scrub those and make sure they are absolutely fit for purpose and that we can - they're absolutely minimum kits. So, like, for instance, I mentioned before that we had taken a pause on the projects in Fawley in the UK. And there is on where we looked at the scope and we decided we could remove one tank from the scope, and that reduced cost. So, things like that that we're looking at the scopes. And then, the other thing is, in these paused times, we're able to completely finish engineering. And so, go out into the field, restart and have complete engineering done, and really have efficient execution once we get back to construction. So, the organization worked at it very hard, took a lot of time, and made sure for every single project, what scope to do and want to finish, when is the right time to restart, what work are we going to do to leave the project in a good shape, what are we going to do in the meantime before we restart, and line all that out. And when you add all that up, we're able to preserve all the value. And with that, I am going to hand over to Andy for the second part of the question. Yes. Thanks, Niel. Let me just take a step back a little bit on how we see things and what we're doing. Basically, we see a world that's going to need more energy going forward; through population, through GDP growth, and a lot of that goes through the non-OECD countries. Energy consumption is tied to the population and GDP. And we don't think the current solutions set is really complete. We think we need more solutions there. And as you think about the size and the complexity of the infrastructure we have today, it's going to take some time to change that. So, to get to your specific question, near-term, what are we focusing on? We're focusing on mitigating our emissions operations and with that we have a commitment to reduce our carbon intensity over time. And that's what we're working on. And so, we kind of release that through our carbon and energy summary every year, how we're doing in that regard in terms of absolute carbon emissions and also the intensity, and that's kind of where we're focused. If you think about all the assets that we had - that we're producing back in, I think 2005, if you look at those today, we've had a significant reduction of those assets. Now, we've brought some new assets on but those reductions in the base through things like Cogen and energy efficiency, have been able to offset the emissions of the new assets we brought on. And then, longer term, we really think we need to be focusing on these high emissions sectors, PowerGen, commercial transportation, and industrial where the technologies are just insufficient to drive deep emission reductions and that's where we're looking for breakthrough technologies. I don't know, Andy, if you want to talk a little bit about the work we're doing there. And that's where we think we can uniquely contribute to society in terms of mitigating the risk of climate change. I think both of those. I agree with both of those statements. The industry is currently oversupplied and rationalizations will - we'll work that over time. Since the start of the pandemic, we've already had a million barrels a day of announced refining closures. So, again, as I mentioned earlier the refining industry is under stress. And as you look to some low to medium conversion refineries, especially those that are not in good geographical locations where you have a growing demand, they're all under water. And so, we've already had some closures. I expect there will likely be more. And the deeper, the longer we stay in this sort of environment, the more announcements will come out. So, yes, I do think we're oversupplied right now and the market will take care of that through these closures. Yes. Thanks, Doug. I'll take a shot at that one. We have quite a bit out in the market right now. We talked about, I think 11 out in the market. We're in fairly advanced discussions on a few of these assets. So, we do think that they're going to have some impact in '21 and '22. As you mentioned, it's a pretty difficult market on asset divestment. We're going to make sure we get value. We have something above our attention value. We are going to be patient. As Andy said, there is very little reliance on that in terms of where we see things in 2021, but we're going to continue to have productive discussions with prospective buyers. And we are seeing good interest. There is no question, we're seeing good interest. These will make some buyers within their portfolio is pretty nicely. So, we're going to continue on, Doug, in that regard. And again, just stick to the fact that we're going to make sure we get value. The assets, we'll keep them in our portfolio. Okay, Jason. Yes, I think, clearly, if you look back in March and April, we're talking about these reduction targets, really, a good bit of that was activity reduction. As we were sparing capacity and refineries and we were curtailing production activity in some of Upstream areas as we were having less chemical demand for the first month or two. And the idea was okay, we're going to certainly make sure we capture all the OpEx reductions in those areas. But also recognizing - and quite frankly, coming into the year, we were already working on the structural efficiencies. Some of that culminated in the workforce announcement that we made earlier and that I reiterated in the prepared presentation. But those efficiencies have been brought about by the reorganization of the businesses along these value chains versus the functions. And it just freed up a lot of capacity in terms of our ability to really get line of sight to the assets and to really up, be able to operate more efficiently, take away some friction, take away from what we call doing business with ourselves, and that kind of thing. As I mentioned before, often in presentations, leveraging digital technologies to where we can, we're more flexible in where we do work and making sure we're doing that in the most cost effective way. So, clearly, initially, there was a lot of reduction based on activity and those are being replaced with structural efficiencies as we move forward and those will play out, not just in 2021 but in 2022 going forward. Yes, Jason. That's a good question. It's certainly plays a role. But as we look at our refining circuit and think about that going forward, we are fortunate that we had some highly complex refineries that very importantly are integrated with chemicals. That Chemicals integration is probably the overlying factor that we look at in terms of asset refiners that we think long-term are going to be very competitive. But we are looking, I think I've showed you before, this net cash margin for all refineries around the world, and the fact that we need to be on the left hand side of that with all our refineries. So, we've invested. We've made some investments in some of those; Antwerp, Rotterdam, Beaumont being some examples, Singapore, that we're going to make substantial moves to look to the left. And those are the refineries we think long term are going to be competitive in long term, but belong in the portfolio. So, we're making that call between ones we're going to invest. The ones that are already there are highly integrated refineries in the Gulf Coast, Baytown, Baton Rouge, and increasingly, Beaumont. And then, those that we're pushing in that direction with some good strategic investments to kind of shore up some of the conversion capacity gaps we've had. But clearly, as you look at kind of a medium, low complexity refineries, in an OECD country, that's not integrated with Chemicals, yeah, those are going to be a challenge going forward and that certainly plays into our thinking."

            "content": "Thank you, Stephen. First and foremost, we hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As we've discussed on previous calls, the challenges presented by COVID-19 are unlike anything the industry has ever seen, as is the response of our employees and contractors. They have gone to great lengths to safely maintain operations, manufacture and deliver the products society needs for sanitation and hygiene, as well as provide the fuels that ensure these and other critical supplies get to the places they are needed. They have responded to unprecedented market conditions with all three of our businesses at, or significantly below, bottom of cycle conditions. We could not be more proud of the exceptional efforts and response of our workforce. We are navigating this near-term uncertainty by achieving record safety and reliability performance, delivering better than expected cash savings that are on pace to exceed our 2020 OpEx and CapEx targets, while maintaining operations integrity and pacing projects to preserve long-term value and position us for the eventual recovery. This slide shows the demand impact of the pandemic. The corresponding industry response and third party projections for the market recovery after the second quarter lows. Crude and product inventories rose to a peak in June as the reduction in demand outpaced supply cuts. In the third quarter, inventories have started to fall as demand recovers and exceeds current supply levels. Third-party estimates suggest liquids inventory decreased by about 200 million barrels in the third quarter and they expect demand to return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. Of course, the demand projections shown here, lead to a few critical questions. How will the supplier respond? What will be the resulting supply and demand balance? And what price is required to achieve this? In light of this, it is worth looking at the fundamentals. I'll start with the next slide with Upstream supply. In the Upstream, which is a depletion business, capital investment is required to add supply to offset ongoing decline. This chart shows an obvious, but sometimes overlooked relationship. Industry investment levels rise and fall at price or more specifically the industry's level of revenue. Low price environments lead to low investment levels, and therefore, less new supply to offset depletion. Eventually, available supply declines, leading to a tight supply and demand balance and higher prices. Over the past five years, we have seen a steady decline in conventional spending, which has been somewhat offset by North American unconventional growth. Pre-pandemic,, the industry was already investing at levels below historic rates and below what would be required to meet future demand and overcome natural depletion. All of this, based on recent estimates, from the International Energy Agency. The overall impact of the pandemic this year has been dramatic, significantly reducing current investment levels, which exacerbates the problem. On top of this, industry exploration continues at multi-decade lows. Meanwhile, underlying production decline of 5% to 6% per year continues relentlessly. Looking forward, if the industry is to meet credible third party estimates for energy demand, we will need to significantly increase investments. This is shown here with a range of third-party estimates for the required level of future investments. For the industry to fund at this level of investments, prices will have to rise. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jack. Thanks. As Jack just highlighted, we have an attractive set of investment opportunities that is continuing to grow. But the constraints brought on by the pandemic, we are actively managing this portfolio of investments, with a focus on advancing our highest value projects. As our opportunity set grows and conditions evolve, we continue to reassess our investment portfolio and prioritize our spend. Each project must remain advantage versus industry, and competitive with our other opportunities. We work to ensure our assets remain a good strategic fit, provide material growth potential, and ultimately create differentiating value. This is a continuous process and an essential element of our annual planning process. It is particularly important this year as we work to develop plans within the constraints brought on by the pandemic. With the challenging price environment and our current debt levels, added emphasis is being placed on evaluating our entire portfolio for the potential of additional asset divestments. While continuing to progress our previously announced divestment program of $15 billion, we may expand it through a reevaluation of our North American dry gas assets, which are currently included in the corporation's long-term development plan. More specifically, we are evaluating the opportunity to bring the value of some of these assets forward by removing them from the development plan and marketing them through our divestment program. In total, the assets under consideration, have carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion, which could be at risk for impairment, depending on the candidates for divestment and the current estimate of their market value. We expect to complete the review as part of our planned process, which will be finalized with the board in November, and will be shared with all of you as part of future earnings calls and at our analyst meeting early next year. Given the importance of the current market conditions on our plans and decisions, I'd like to return to the price and margin environment and the earnings potential of the corporation. Historically, our three businesses, each significant in the industry, are typically a different points in their business cycles, which helps mitigate the impacts of their downcycles. In this unprecedented environment, all three businesses are simultaneously experiencing prices and margins below the 10 year range, significantly impacting the corporations earnings. We see the impact in the broader industry, with mounting losses, reduced investments and increased closures. And while questions remain around future demand recovery, one thing is certain, current conditions cannot continue. Supply and demand will eventually meet, prices and margins will respond. This suggests there is much more margin and price upside than downside going forward, and therefore, an expected increase in earnings. For perspective, the earnings range over the prior 10 year period has been between $2 billion and $8 billion per year in the Downstream, and between $1 billion and $5 billion per year in Chemical, far cry from where we are today. And while we may not see a return to average earnings in the near term, we should at least move to the bottom end of the historic range, which we see as the minimum levels demonstrated by a decade of industry experience. This is the basis upon which we are building next year's plan. If we see a recovery, just to the bottom of the 10 year range, and our Brent crude price in the range of credible third party estimates, we will be able to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt flat with second quarter levels. This morning, we've given you an overview of how we are navigating the challenging near-term market environment and discussed how market forces will restore supply and demand balances and improve the price and margin environment. The longer-term fundamentals remain robust, economies will recover, people's lives will improve, and the demand for energy will grow. In the short term, you've seen adjustments in our capital allocation, but our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged; investing at advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable and growing dividend. We're developing a 2021 plan consistent with the uncertainties and in line with the simultaneous low margins and prices in each of our businesses. Our CapEx will be further reduced to the range of $16 billion to $19 billion. We're further reducing our cash operating expense with a focus on overhead. We are looking to increase divestments and working to maintain the dividend, while holding gross debt at second quarter levels. Of course, we all recognize the uncertainty in today's market. We are keeping a close eye on developments and importantly on maintaining the flexibility to respond as conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn it back to Jack. Yes. Thanks for the question, Sam. I mentioned earlier, we're at 15 rigs now, going down to about 10, and we think 10 to 12 rigs will be where we're going to be in '21. Of course, with an eye towards what the market does. That's substantially down from our earlier plans, where we were planning to continue to, more or less, stay at a rig level in the kind of 50 rig, 50 to 60 rig level in the Permian. Growth is substantially down. But look, I just want to just reinforce that the decision to reduce the spin due to the cash flow constraints is not at all a reflection of our development results, it's quite to the contrary. We're very pleased with how things are going. I mentioned the efficiency improvement that we've seen. We're continuing to gain experience with the cube developments and confirming those are a lot of value in that approach. So, we're very confident in the quality of the resource, including the unique development plan we have in the Delaware Basin, and then also the logistics integration we had at the Gulf Coast. So, we really like what we're seeing out there. We're just going to curtail activity because we have the discretion to do so and defer and move some of that capital to other opportunities. Good morning, Devin. I think, let me - and this is a really important point and I think the question that's on a lot of people's mind. So, I'd like to take a little bit of time to go back through and really cover the way we're thinking about this. From an overall messaging point, our objective is to maintain the dividend, advance the highest value investments, and maintain the debt at a cost competitive limit. With prices at the low end at the historical ranges, looking at those bars there at the low end of those historical ranges, the plans we're working on to accomplish this, that will accomplish this, why is that? Because of the actions we've taken; the OpEx reduction, the workforce reduction, capital reduction to a level optimized to preserve long-term value, yet at a level that preserves flexibility and access to debt markets. And prices and margins, as we've said, are at a historic lows across all three businesses. That's obviously not where we are today when you look at those diamonds. But if you look at the mounting losses across the industry, the reduced investments we're seeing, the rationalizations, the project cancellations, the deferrals, it's clear to us that we're going to see an improvement in the industry. Our base plan conservatively assumes a gradual economic recovery and modest prices, not unlike our past plans and consistent with third-party ranges, including the oil price, which you asked about. It's really hard to predict the pace and a path to recovery for each of the businesses, and they do offset to some extent as we've talked about here. As an example, our gas business is currently running ahead of our assumptions. Refining is also up, as you point out, from the third quarter lows. We have built some contingency into our plans and believe we have enough to accommodate the uncertainty. But as I said, we keep a close eye on weather developments. The plans have a modest amount of asset sales in there. As I said, we have a lot in the market. We are in active discussions. We have bids coming in. And again, as I also talked about, we're looking at the plans and finalizing the plans of potentially putting even more into the market. So, there is a modest level of asset sales in those plans. Across the businesses. Jeanine, thanks for the question. As we've said in the past, we really want to ensure that we remain competitive access - cost competitive access to debt. Why is that? We do have refinancing needs going forward in the future as term debt matures. But we also want to maintain a level of balance sheet flexibility. We believe that going above the $70 billion level, that second quarter level, is going to impact those objectives. Again, when we think about what might happen in the future, lot of hypotheticals there. Our plans comprehend a bunch of uncertainty. We do need to get back to the bottom of cycle type conditions. This is not a cycle. The pandemic is out with cycle experience there in order to be able to continue to move forward in a way that we've talked about. But I would say that if things go along the way they are, if they were to persist this way, and we don't think they will, because the energies can't survive. And there's going to be a lot of measures being taken by a lot of people's to react to the situation. Hi, Devin. Thanks for the question. It's obviously, the phenomenon, if I look just first at North America, I know your question's on LNG, is driven by people looking at supply and demand balance as related to the relative under investment that's been going on there for a while. That's important. Because it's also in the long term when you think about LNG. That will come into play down the road as well. North America is an important source of LNG supply these days. But the concept of under investment leading to supply and demand issues in the long term is also fundamental with the LNG business as well. We have seen a good business continuing to go forward in LNG. A lot of the businesses are still unrelated to our linkages with crude price, index prices to crude and so forth, so it's rebounded. It is rebounding with the crude price run up in the third quarter there. That's a good thing. I think as the world resumes economic growth, you're going to continue to see the LNG business grow very strongly, probably above GDP as it was before. There is no reason not to believe that's going to happen, as it works its way into more power generation around the world, industrial applications, so forth. And to the extent that there is a hiatus in LNG investment. We are deferring some of our projects with a short term time, probably underpins a continuing strong fundamental future for that business. Sure. Hi, the three-legged story you referred to that Darren talked about, I mean that is our capital allocation priorities; investing in advantage projects, to maintaining a strong balance sheet, and then paying the reliable and growing dividend. The CapEx piece of it is fundamentally important because as you quite rightly reflect, the CapEx we spend now is what those investments in America, what pay are the future dividends. We worked very hard on the 2020 and the 2021 CapEx levels, to get them to the point where we're maintaining progress on just the highest priority investments we're pausing, and deferring the remainder. And as Jack just pointed out, were doing that very carefully to ensure that we're preserving the bag and all that. For the programs that we've talked about in 2020 and 2021, that 2020 were in the range of $16 billion to $19 billion, that is about, in our judgment, that's the level that we think is the right one there. Obviously, as I said, we've maintained a little bit of contingency. There's a little bit of flex and all that. But that's really the level that we have judged to be the right one to balance getting through this crisis we're in. Now the pandemic, this way below the bottom of the cycle type thing. Preserve those opportunities and then be able to start moving the CapEx up in the outer years as the conditions in the world improve. As we have said they certainly must, given where industry is right now. Yes, Jack. You're absolutely right. The world does not have the complete solutions to get to where we need to meet that dual challenge of meeting the needs associated with economic growth while reducing emissions. Our focus is on, as Jack said, what we can do on our own operations, the targets set there, very much on the technology to fill those solution sets. And we talked a little bit about our nature and call. We talked about the Global Thermostat, the arrangement that we have a Director [indiscernible] front Stephen mentioned that. And you've seen other ones from time to time there. But we have a large research program ongoing in these sectors. We talked about algae in the past. We've talked about carbon capture and sequestration in general many times. These are the things that the world is going to need and these are the things that we have a unique capability in many cases. To take a lot of the ideas that are out there in society that people come to us and others with, and lack the specific capabilities or capacities to make the advancements in things like material sciences to improve something, to improve a particular catalyst that might be unnecessary. And they certainly lag the broad experience of process engineering that we have that is necessary to bring some of these technologies to scale. There are many things in flight there, but a lot of it is R&D. And I think in a world that is impatient for solutions. It's very hard to be patient to allow the R&D to happen, but we are, and we have that kind of posture towards it. And we certainly hope to be able to talk more and more about that in the coming years. Doug, this is something that we have thought long and hard about. We've discussed with our Board every quarter when we make the dividend discussion. But I'll tell you, we fully understand the importance of the dividend to our shareholders. It's very important to them and we're very thoughtful on that. What we've done is said to ourselves, let's look and see, and balancing in capital allocation and balancing with how we see with the likelihood the world evolving. What the right plan is to be able to meet our shareholders needs, interest in the dividend, at the same time moving the business forward there. So, we've constructed a plan that based on the things what we see happening in the market. The calibrations of what the business is doing, balance all of those sort of things and retain a little bit of flexibility as it goes forward. Now, as we talked about before, we do see ourselves moving back to bottom of the cycle conditions because the industry simply cannot continue on at these levels here, and in that plan, we will be able to maintain the dividend. We get into some situation where we're back in a world like we've been in the second and third quarters, obviously, all bets are off. And I think that's true across the industry. But we also don't think that's sustainable. So, that's really the rationale behind it and that's the way we've talked about it with the board and that's where we talk about it with outside agencies, that's where we talk about with our general investor class when we have those discussions. Doug, as I said we put the plan together for 2021 based on our best assessment of the market. It has some contingency on it, some flexibility on it, but were we to run out of that contingency, obviously we'd have to look to pull the next lever. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. I'm not really in position to give you a number on that."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Before getting started, I wanted to say that I hope all of you on the call, your families and colleagues, are safe in light of the challenges our world continues to face. Joining me today is ExxonMobil Senior Vice President, Neil Chapman, who oversees our Upstream business. After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Neil will provide his perspectives and provide an update on the steps we're taking to navigate the current market environment and ensure we remain well positioned for the recovery. Following Neil's remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results, while Neil will be available to take your questions on broader themes, including the corporation's strategic priorities, progress on spending reductions, updates on major projects and views on market fundamentals.  Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I'll now highlight the developments since the first quarter of this year on the next slide.  In the Upstream, liquids realizations fell by about 50% compared to the first quarter as impacts from the coronavirus rippled through the global economy, significantly reducing demand. In response to the unprecedented market conditions, production was curtailed by approximately 330,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter. Despite considerable challenges, including global travel and supply chain disruptions, we were able to maintain strong operational performance in all of our businesses. We also progressed growth projects such as Guyana, with Phase 1 demonstrating nameplate production capacity, and we progressed Phase II FPSO topside integration in Singapore. In the Permian, the Delaware central processing and exporting facility started up, which enhances our integrated position in the basin through collection and processing of production from our Delaware Basin assets and enables efficient, lower-cost delivery to Gulf Coast markets. In the Downstream, refining margins decreased from first quarter levels and were 50% below 10-year annual lows, reflecting the significant reduction in demand and the resulting impact of increased levels of product inventory.  Refinery sparing was approximately 30% with reduced demand. However, utilization improved through the quarter as we saw early signs of recovery from the lows, including demand for road transportation fuels. Although bottom-of-cycle conditions persist in the Chemical business, margins were sustained at first quarter levels, with lower realizations being offset by lower feedstock costs. While COVID-19 impacted demand in the chemical industry, the impact across our portfolio was moderated by resilient demand in the packaging and hygiene segments.  At a corporate level, our people continue to support COVID-19 response efforts through our manufacturing operations and donations of critical products and resources, which Neil will highlight a bit later in the call. We also launched a collaboration with universities, environmental groups and other industry partners to find new and better ways to monitor and reduce methane emissions. The first of its kind effort called Project Astra is focused on developing an innovative sensor network in the Permian Basin to continuously monitor methane emissions across large areas to enable quick and efficient detection and repair of leaks, ultimately leading to lower emissions.  Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of second quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of second quarter results relative to the first quarter. Starting with first quarter 2020, the reported loss of $600 million included [unfavorable] [ph] identified items of $2.9 billion, driven mostly by noncash inventory adjustments. Excluding these items, first quarter earnings were $2.3 billion. Second quarter results included a $1.9 billion noncash benefit from inventory valuation, largely reversing the first quarter impact due to the improvement in commodity prices relative to the end of March and resulted in a second quarter U.S. GAAP loss of $1.1 billion. Excluding identified items, there was a $3 billion loss in the second quarter, down $5.3 billion from the first quarter driven by the effects of COVID-19, including the unprecedented decline in oil and product demand, resulting in significant declines in prices. These impacts were in line with the market factors that we previously communicated.  Within the quarter, April marked a low point, with results improving through May and June. However, it's worth noting refining margins remain very challenged, notably in North America with record high product inventories. Beyond the significant reduction in prices and margins, lower volumes in the quarter due to the demand impacts from the pandemic reduced earnings by $600 million. Lower operating expenses across all 3 of our businesses from reduced activity, lower overhead, logistics optimization and supply chain efficiencies improved earnings by $800 million. These efforts demonstrate the progress we've made towards our 15% cash OpEx savings target.  Moving to Slide 5. Upstream earnings, excluding identified items, decreased by approximately $3 billion, largely driven by lower prices, with liquids realizations down 50% and natural gas realizations down 25% versus the first quarter. Foreign exchange and other impacts reduced earnings by $360 million. Volume impacts were driven by timing of scheduled maintenance activity and lower European seasonal gas demand. Expenses were lower in the quarter with savings related to efficiencies and work processes, reduced unconventional and exploration activity and market-related savings, including lower contractor rates and lower rates on materials and supplies.  On the next slides, I will provide more details on volumes. Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter. Due to the challenging market conditions, we curtail production in unconventional and heavy oil assets starting in April. Additional government-mandated reductions were implemented in May. As previously mentioned, natural gas demand was seasonally lower, primarily in Europe. Scheduled maintenance, notably in our LNG portfolio, also contributed to lower volumes.  Compared to the second quarter 2019, Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. In addition to the factors I just referenced, volumes were lower due mainly to the divestment of the Norway non-operated assets at the end of 2019. It's worth noting that half of the divestment impact was related to gas volumes. Finally, we saw continued liquids growth from our investments in the Permian, Abu Dhabi and Guyana, reflecting the continued value growth we are focused on.  Moving to Downstream on Slide 8. Earnings, excluding identified items, decreased approximately $2 billion relative to the first quarter. Lower margins and demand impacts driven by COVID-19 decreased earnings by nearly $2.6 billion, with refining capacity spared in line with significantly reduced demand. Included in the margin factor is the absence of first quarter's favorable mark-to-market impact of $1.1 billion and an unfavorable impact of approximately $200 million in the second quarter. This period-to-period impact was driven by significant volatility in the prices of the underlying commodities.  Our trading program is structured to maximize the value from our global asset base, leveraging our logistics and insights across the value chain. We are positioned to capture value as market disconnects occur, for example, by utilizing storage for crude and products when logistics capacity tightens. That said, trading and the use of financial derivatives to capture arbitrage opportunities can introduce additional volatility in our results due to the timing of recognizing [open] [ph] financial derivatives while not having the physical offset at the same time. Lower turnaround activity increased earnings by $190 million. Reduced expenses, including logistics efficiencies and lower contract rates, contributed another $220 million to the second quarter results.  Moving to the next slide, I will discuss downstream results relative to second quarter 2019. Earnings, excluding identified items, decreased approximately $1.1 billion versus the second quarter of 2019. The drivers are similar to what I just discussed, absent the significant mark-to-market effects associated with the swings in commodity prices. I would highlight the $0.5 billion contribution we saw year-over-year from lower turnaround activity and increased production of higher-value products as a result of the recent investments in our manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we continue to see the benefit of expense reductions and efficiencies discussed on the previous slide, which improved earnings by $340 million.  Moving to the next slide, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings, excluding identified items, decreased by just over $100 million. The margin impact quarter-to-quarter was flat, reflecting similar trends in feedstock cost and product realizations. While we benefited from resilient demand in the packaging and hygiene segments, COVID-19 had a more significant impact on our durables in the automotive sector, resulting in overall reduced volumes impacting earnings by $170 million. Consistent with what we saw across the corporation, reduced expenses, including impacts from turnaround and maintenance efficiencies and supply chain savings, improved Chemical earnings by $110 million in the quarter.  Turning to Slide 11. Chemical earnings, excluding identified items, increased by more than $150 million relative to the second quarter of 2019. While higher margins from lower fee costs improved earnings by $140 million, this is more than offset by lower volumes from COVID-19 impacts on demand. However, we saw dramatically lower expenses, improving earnings by nearly $250 million, with drivers consistent with what we saw on the prior slide.  The next slide highlights the strong progress we've made to date, reducing spend in response to the current market environment. Back in April, we announced that we will be reducing 2020 CapEx by 30% and cash operating expenses by 15%. Through the second quarter, we are on track to meet or exceed these targets. Cash operating costs in the second quarter were down about 15% relative to the first quarter, with reductions across all 3 of our businesses, as I previously mentioned. The cost reductions reflect decreased activity, maintenance and turnaround efficiencies, reduced contractor rates and lower structural costs from logistics optimization and supply chain efficiencies. As we optimize work processes, including how and where we perform work, we have identified structural opportunities that have lowered our costs.  In terms of our capital spend, second quarter was down 25% versus the first quarter. We are pacing investment in the near term while prioritizing capital optionality that preserves long-term value. Additionally, we have optimized project execution plans to further reduce spend. Our short-cycle investments, particularly in the Permian, provide us with optionality as the market recovers. We want to be well positioned to capture the eventual upswing.  Moving to Slide 13. Let me highlight steps we have taken to improve liquidity and ensure the corporation is well positioned to manage the current market environment. During the quarter, we leveraged our access to capital markets by issuing approximately $15 billion in debt, including approximately $5 billion of euro-denominated bonds. This issuance enabled us to capture attractive euro bond rates and diversify our fixed income investor base. The corporation's total liquidity has increased significantly since year-end 2019. As Neil will discuss in greater detail momentarily, we believe we now have sufficient capacity to weather the near-term market challenges and preserve our long-term growth plans and capital allocation priorities.  Let's turn to the next page for a look at the second quarter cash profile. Second quarter cash flow from operating activities was in line with our projections of the COVID-19 impacts. There was an increase in working capital in the quarter driven by a seasonal reduction in payables and a continued inventory build coming out of the first quarter associated with a steep reduction in demand. Gross debt increased approximately $10 billion in the quarter, reflecting the steps I just mentioned to increase liquidity in light of the current market uncertainty. As a result, we ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of cash.  Turning to Slide 15. I will cover a few key items for consideration with regards to our outlook for the third quarter. In the upstream, economic production curtailments are expected to average 60,000 oil equivalent barrels as market conditions have continued to show improvement. And we're forecasting an impact of 140,000 oil equivalent barrels with a full quarter of government-mandated curtailments in line with public announcements.  In the Downstream, we anticipate scheduled maintenance to be down slightly from the second quarter. However, as we reflect on the current business environment, including the high inventory levels, we would expect margins to remain very weak. In Chemical, we anticipate demand improvement in key durable and automotive sectors, partly offset by higher feed costs. Scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with the first quarter of this year. Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $800 million, and we expect continued spending reductions consistent with our announced targets.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Neil.\nNeil Chapman: Thanks, Stephen. It's great to be on the call this morning. I hope that all of you joining us and your families are safe and healthy, and I want to extend the gratitude of everyone here at ExxonMobil to all of the men and women working on the front lines to fight the virus and to help those suffering from its effects. I'd also like to thank our employees for all that they are doing to support the response efforts globally.  As we indicated during the first quarter, we anticipated the COVID pandemic and related economic shutdowns would significantly impact the financial performance of companies across multiple sectors in the second quarter, and we've seen that reflected in the results announced to date. As Stephen just discussed, the same external factors were evident in our second quarter earnings and cash flows. However, there's reason to be encouraged that we may have seen the trough in April when WTI hit a historic low point and then began to rebound as economic activity picked up and demand showed signs of increasing. By the end of the quarter, WTI had risen to around $40 per barrel, with Brent trading slightly above that, and oil prices have remained relatively stable at that level in recent weeks.  I'd like to begin with a few overarching comments on one of the most challenging quarters this industry has seen. We have acted quickly and decisively while preserving long-term value. The organization has responded with a level of commitment and professionalism that has been exceptional. We rapidly adjusted our plans and asked the organization to deliver on very aggressive new targets. They have delivered. Through all of the challenges this environment has presented, we have safely maintained the integrity and continuity of our operations while also making the necessary adjustments to COVID-19 to provide a safe work environment for our workforce and support global response efforts. This success should not be underestimated. Essentially all of our global facilities, Upstream, Downstream and Chemical, have operated without interruption. You can imagine the challenge of maintaining a virus-free environment on offshore platforms and refineries, where our workforce live and work in close proximity. We've had to charge planes to move our rotating operating staff all over the globe without the availability of commercial planes. We've had to lease hotels in multiple cities to quarantine our folks before they start their 30-day rotations. Our organization's ingenuity has been remarkable.  We've responded quickly to the rapidly changing price and margin environment by shutting in facilities when necessary and capturing value from the rapidly changing prices, leveraging our extensive supply chains around the world. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made reducing costs and pacing investments to adjust to the market conditions. As Stephen described, we set very aggressive operating and capital expense targets. The organization is exceeding those targets, which positions us very well for the rest of the year. We ended the quarter with more than $12.5 billion of cash, which is in line with the business needs. Given this level of liquidity, we don't see a need to take on additional debt.  Before I dive into the business, I want to highlight some of the amazing work our people have done in response to the COVID pandemic. These efforts included reconfiguring manufacturing operations, optimizing processes and delivery systems, enabling us to increase production of essential chemicals that are critical to the world's medical response, including isopropyl alcohol for hand sanitizer and specialty polypropylene for masks and medical garments. Our people have stepped up to contribute educational supplies to schools, fuel and PPE for first responders and financial support to food banks and many other related causes. If you haven't already, I encourage you to visit our website to see all of the inspiring ways our employees have contributed during this time of need.  Now I'll turn to what we're seeing in the markets. Consistent with oil prices reaching historic lows, our own retail sales reflect a bottoming of transportation fuel demand in April, followed by some encouraging signs of recovery. The shape of the recovery varies by region, though the demand in Asia recently surpassed where it was a year ago. This data is from the International Energy Agency. What we saw was a historic demand contraction for transportation fuels with countries around the world impacted at nearly the same time, but we are seeing a recovery from the recent lows. Reflecting the improving demand trends we're seeing, the IEA's view of the next 18 months is similar to ours. They're forecasting a rebound in road transportation fuels, with fourth quarter 2020 demand expected to be at similar levels to the fourth quarter of the prior year. The recovery in jet fuel demand is likely to be much slower with by far the sharpest reduction in demand and the slowest recovery expected. As you would expect, the impact of lower demand was apparent in the second quarter, the refinery crude throughput, about 15% below 2019 levels. This resulted in pressure on margins, which Stephen discussed a few moments ago.  Looking more broadly at total liquids demand, the second quarter was down about 20% year-on-year, but it's important to note the actual loss of demand was not as severe as some had expected, considering the low end of the range was about 30%. Simply put, the demand distraction in the second quarter was unprecedented in the history of modern oil markets. To put it in context, absolute demand fell to levels we haven't seen in nearly 20 years. We've never seen a decline in this magnitude and pace before, even relative to the historic periods of demand volatility following the global financial crisis and as far back as the 1970s oil and energy crisis. In response to this lower demand, we saw a similarly unprecedented reduction of supply in the second quarter as OPEC+ was down approximately 11 million barrels a day in May and June. North American production shut-ins are estimated to have peaked at more than 2 million barrels per day. However, in line with the extraordinary drop we saw in demand, inventory levels increased to unprecedented levels, and we anticipate it will be well into 2021 before the overhang is cleared and we return to pre-pandemic levels.  As mentioned, clearly, the industry has taken significant steps to reduce production. We have taken decisive action in this regard as well. Curtailment impacts in the quarter were about 330,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Roughly 2/3 of these volumes were economic curtailments in unconventional and heavy oil. We brought the majority of production from our shorter-cycle unconventional plays back online in July as market conditions recovered. For our heavy oil assets, we took advantage of the economic curtailments to pull forward planned maintenance. At Kearl, we completed a maintenance shutdown on line 2, and it's now back online. In the middle of July, we shut down line 1 for similar planned maintenance, and this is expected to return to service in late August. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate an impact of approximately 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from curtailments, with about 70% of those mandated by governments.  Turning to the Permian Basin. Second quarter production was nearly 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. That's a 9% increase versus the second quarter of 2019. We continue to anticipate 2020 production will be about 345,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. It's down just 15,000 barrels per day from what we discussed back in March despite the curtailments and the sharp reduction in capital expenditure and still more than 70,000 barrels per day above the full year of 2019. During the quarter, we started up the Delaware Basin central processing and exporting facility, which we refer to as Cowboy. As I discussed in March, this is a key building block in our Poker Lake major development. As we've discussed previously, the short-cycle nature of our Permian assets also provides flexibility to pace development, reduce spend and preserve cash in the current environment. We cut our rig count by about half, ending the quarter with 30 rigs in the Permian Basin, and we expect to cut that number by at least half again by the end of this year. Our activities for the rest of the year will be focused on Poker Lake, where we will continue to leverage our development scale advantage and utilize the above-surface investments that we have pursued in the last 18 months, including Cowboy.  In light of the recent low price environment, we also pushed out the flowback of our largest to date cube development to the third quarter. This is the 27 well cube in the Midland Basin that I referenced at our Investor Day. Again, this decision reflects our focus on making the appropriate decisions to maximize the value of each well and adapt as market conditions become more favorable, including optimize completion timing for our inventory of drilled uncomplete wells.  In Guyana, Liza Phase 1 demonstrated production capacity of 120,000 barrels per day during the quarter. The response to a mechanical issue that we experienced in May was slowed by logistical challenges of mobilizing technical experts and materials in-country due to COVID restrictions. So these are close to being resolved, and we expect to get back to full capacity with 100% gas injection in August.  We're still actively investing for the future in Guyana, with 4 drilling rigs as of the end of June with 1 on exploration and 3 on appraisal and project development drilling. Subsequent to the quarter end, drilling at Yellowtail 2 identified 2 additional high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, 1 adjacent and 1 below the Yellowtail field. Liza Phase 2 remains on schedule for a 2022 start-up. You can see the FPSO in the photo, which is currently in Singapore for the top site integration.  We are continuing to work with the government on approval for the Payara development plan. Without final resolution of the election results and signing in a new government, there is a potential for delays to the schedule. Having said that, it's very clear that all parties in-country understand the importance of progressing the developments quickly given the significant benefits to all stakeholders, especially the citizens of Guyana.  Let's now turn to the progress we're making on the aggressive cost reduction measures we put in place earlier this year, starting with capital expenditures. In April, we reduced our plan for this year by 30% to $23 billion. We're on pace to meet or exceed that target. In fact, our annualized run rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be around $19 billion, and we expect to be lower still in 2021. Savings during the second quarter were primarily driven by short-cycle unconventional activity, but I should note that we're also adjusting the pace of other investments in all of our businesses. As we previously mentioned, we continue to take a very thoughtful and comprehensive approach to these cost reductions in partnership with our contractors, partners and governments. You will hear me say several times this morning the importance of addressing the short-term market challenges while conserving cash and preserving long-term value and future optionality. This helps us ensure that while investments may be deferred in some areas, the opportunities remain. Given the continued uncertainty and volatility, we will continue to adjust CapEx reductions as needed while also being mindful that the pullback we're seeing across the industry today could very well lay the foundation for supply challenges in the future, and we want to make sure we're positioned to capture the eventual upswing.  In addition to our targeted near-term CapEx reductions, we also laid out plans to reduce cash operating expenses by 15% in 2020. Again, we are delivering. We're ahead of pace to achieve that target, with savings coming from a wide range of activities including lower unconventional activity, optimizing supply chains, lower material and service costs and work process improvements to reduce support and overhead costs. So these are just a few examples. Our savings are widespread across the corporation. More importantly, we're doing it without compromising safety or operational integrity.  Over the past few years, we underwent a reorganization of our businesses from what were primarily functional organization structures to aligning a long value chain. These reorganizations reduce the senior leadership structure and associated overhead and improved the line of sight across the value chains to better drive performance from our assets. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed how this organization has provided a new lens on the business to identify and improve ways to drive further efficiencies. You might recall, Darren made the point that our plan for this year included reducing our operating cost on our base assets by more than $1 billion, and he said that we would do even better in 2021. So we came into the current environment in a good position to respond quickly. We're confident that we will meet or exceed our cost reduction targets for 2020.  Looking ahead to 2021, we see significant potential for additional reductions based on identification of further long-term structural efficiencies, reduced activity levels and an evaluation of our workforce requirements, including the potential for further reductions in overhead and management positions. Our plan is to continue looking at reductions business by business and country by country. Consistent with our annual budgeting process, we're working through these plans, and we would expect to have them finalized during the second half of the year and share them with you early next year.  Let me now address capital allocation. Our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. In a depletion commodity business, you have to invest in accretive advantaged projects to sustain a strong foundation to generate cash flows into the future. In a capital-intensive cyclical business, such as ours, it is critically important to maintain a strong balance sheet. This enables us to sustain through the commodity price cycle and be flexible when opportunities present themselves. It has been a strength of this corporation for decades, and it is an advantage that we will maintain. Finally, we have a long history of providing a reliable and growing dividend. A large portion of our shareholder base has come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income, and we take that very seriously. While we manage our capital allocation priorities over the long term, we also recognize the need to balance in the near term to respond to market conditions. In response to the unprecedented environment that we find ourselves in, we've taken decisive action in 2020.  To recap what we've done so far this year. We've reduced short-term capital spending by more than 30%. We're on pace to reduce cash operating expenses by more than 15%. We've increased debt to a level we feel as appropriate to provide liquidity, given market uncertainties, and we will hold it at that level. And we're continuing to pay a reliable dividend.  Given the ongoing uncertainty in the business environment, we're developing plans that will enable us to maintain our capital allocation priorities over the near term. These plans contemplate a price environment that is consistent with the range of third-party estimates and in line with the shape of the recovery that I discussed moments ago. The plans will include further reducing operating expenses and identifying additional opportunities to efficiently defer more CapEx. Doing so will enable us to maintain the dividend and hold debt at its current level. Of course, this is a volatile market, and we can't know with certainty how the market will evolve from here. There are simply too many unknowns. While we're developing plans based on what we and other third parties can reasonably expect to happen, we have to maintain a certain degree of flexibility to be able to respond to potential improvement or further degradation.  Before we open up the call for questions, I want to reemphasize a few key points. Our people continue to demonstrate a commitment to safety and operational integrity and continuity in an incredibly challenging environment. Our company continues to benefit from the integration advantages we've built across the value chain. We remain focused on driving down costs and pacing investments to manage the near-term market challenges. We've maintained financial capacity in line with our business needs and the market environment. We will continue to be there for the communities and frontline workers who depend on the products and support we can provide to combat the ongoing pandemic. I am confident in our organization and our plans. We will overcome the challenges of the current environment just as we've overcome many challenges in the past.  Thank you, and we look forward to taking your questions.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you for your comments, Neil. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: My first question is on the debt. And in terms of the commentary that Exxon doesn't need to take on any additional debt, it implies a price and CapEx assumption. Can you provide a little more color on what your price assumption is? And what range of demand scenarios would you look at compared to what you laid out in the presentation, which was really helpful? Just wondering also if the message is that Exxon will adjust CapEx through the price environment regardless of what the impact on production is in order to just pull the line on that debt.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, this is Neil. Thanks for joining the call. Good to hear from you. Of course, as you are aware, in the response to this environment, which clearly has been unprecedented, we've never seen the market demand crash so far, so deep. We've never seen prices and margins crash so much, and that's why having a strong balance sheet is so important. And I would tell you, that's why the financial discipline of this corporation over many, many decades has been so critical. It means you can weather the big storms. It means you can weather the large-scale disruptions. And of course, it also means you can reward the loyalty of our shareholders by sticking with them when the business recovers and sticking with the plans we have in place to protect this balance sheet and maintain our dividend.  As we've just been discussing or describing, we took really, really decisive steps for this year, so the short-term capital spending reduction of 30% to 15% in operating expenses. This is very much in line with what we saw in our April earnings call. You will recall that Darren laid out our plans then. What we said we needed to do at that time, we've done. The results are on track and are in line with our expectations. So we set out the plans for this year with these reductions. We're now developing plans that are going to enable us to maintain our capital allocation priorities over the near term, and these plans contemplate a price environment that's generally consistent with third parties. Of course, we've seen the third-party assessment of the price environment going forward converge, and we're in line with those. Our plans to maintain our debt at the current levels and maintain our dividend include further reductions in operating expenses, and we're working hard to identify additional opportunities to what I always describe as efficiently deferring more CapEx, and that preserves the optionality and the future value that responds to these short-term needs.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. My follow-up, I guess, just on the further CapEx reductions that you mentioned. If oil prices are modest and you're looking to any potential delays from more projects, you've mentioned in the past that there's always a cost associated with delaying those projects. And so can you just address that? And what kind of projects you might think like the opportunities to defer? I know the run rate of $19 billion that you're talking about is significantly lower than the 2020 budget. On the flip side of things, given the project backlog, at what point does M&A become a more attractive option in sort of delaying things as a means to kind of grow the medium- and long-term cash flows?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. Well, we remain committed to progressing the structural improvements to our earnings and the cash flow that we've laid out for the last 3 years, but we have to be more selective in pacing those investments in light of the market environment. And of course and as we've described and actually Darren described as well in April, we've completed a thorough review of all of our ongoing investments and our ongoing investment opportunities. But in our business, that means you got to work with the resource owners, you've got to work with the partners, you've got to work with the stakeholders. We've got to identify areas where we can defer spending but conserve cash in the near term and, of course, preserve that long-term value.  What we have done, and I think we've done really successfully, is we've identified market efficiencies, we have identified project synergies that will offset the cost of these deferrals. But there will be impacts. I mean that's for sure. And there will be impact mainly in timing, and that's to the earnings and cash flow potential that we've previously communicated. So it's clear, I think, from our comments and our actions. In the short term, we'll defend the balance sheet, and we'll protect the dividend by taking short-term postponements in capital investments.  In terms of what we will do next year, of course, we're working through that now, and that's part of our annual planning process. And we're working through that now. And as you're well aware, our planned process concludes with a review with our Board of Directors in November. That will be the same this year as it is every year. And when we have clarity on what that capital spend will be next year, of course, we will communicate it to you. As I have mentioned in my comments, my expectation is our capital spending next year will be lower than the fourth quarter run rate.  In terms of M&A and could that provide a different option to -- I mean, Jeanine, of course, we're looking at that all time. We're looking all the time. And if the right opportunity comes up, then we may elect to move on that. But what I would say is, and I said this before and I certainly said it at the Investor Day, we have, I would say, the very richest set of competitive investment opportunities within this company already. I mean I don't think there's a company out there that can compete with that, and so there's no need for us to do an M&A. We don't need to do that. We have very, very attractive investments to make, but we always look at that option.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. We'll move on for now to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDouglas Leggate: Can you all hear me okay?\nStephen Littleton: Sure can, Doug.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, we can, Doug.\nDouglas Leggate: So a lot of questions. I'll stick with two. Neil, you talked about your run rate CapEx being $19 billion in the second half and below that in 2021, and you are still growing the Permian, and you're still executing Guyana. Can you then confirm that, that would still include growth capital? And what I'm trying to get to is some idea of what ExxonMobil sustaining capital is, in other words, ex growth, if you can help me with that.\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Thanks, Doug. Just to clarify one point. Our run rate of $19 billion is in the fourth quarter, not the second half, just so you're aware. And what I said is I expect, Doug, it will be lower. We will fund all the Guyana opportunities as they come forward. Of course, as we look at our capital spend, we're looking hard at the priorities on them. And Guyana, we will continue to fund, and you're well aware that Liza 2 is in construction. I'm confident we'll move on Payara as well.  In terms of the Permian, one of the great attractions of short cycle is you can take that capital off quickly. And of course, you can put it back on pretty quickly as well. Our current planning is that we will continue to reduce the number of rigs we have out in the Permian through the second half of this year. I think we are about, if I remember the numbers, about 30 rigs in the Permian at the end of the third quarter -- at the end of the second quarter. I would anticipate we'll be in the range of 15, maybe 10 to 15 at the end of the year, and that really is just a short term to manage our current capital planning.  Those rigs that we have in the Permian will be focused on that Poker Lake development. So what we're doing is we're concentrating, we're concentrating our developments in the Permian in that core activity in Poker Lake that we've talked about for the last 2 times, the last 2 Investor Days.  I would tell you in terms of ongoing sustaining capital, I'm always reluctant in our business to put a number to that because as your portfolio changes and as you make divestments, it's not a number to lock in, and I'm really, really reluctant to put a number on that. I would tell you it's somewhat easier in the Chemicals and Downstream businesses. I mean I think an order of magnitude on sustaining capital in those businesses will be in the $2 billion to $4 billion range. But I think in the Upstream, it's more difficult to quantify in that way.\nDouglas Leggate: I understand this is tricky, and I appreciate at least framing the answer. Gosh, I'm going to go to Guyana, if I may, on my second question. You used an interesting term of phrase, there is a potential for a delay. And if I preface my question like this, our understanding is that the Payara hole is well ahead of schedule. [indiscernible] I believe in Indonesia right now, there or thereabouts. My understanding is also that Bayphase has not yet finished its review of the development. And although we do not yet have a government, everything seems to be ahead of schedule. So what exactly are you signaling on Payara in terms of the risk or the potential for delay?\nNeil Chapman: Well, Doug, it's really very simple. Everything we and the partners can do to progress Payara on schedule, we are doing and we've done. I've said to our organization many times, we need to be ready to move as soon as the government is ready. And we are ready. We're ready to FID this project, but we need an approved development plan, and that approved development plan needs to come from the government. And all the work with Bayphase and on the development plan, that's been worked for a long, long time. Of course, we're waiting for a resolution, like everybody else, of the election. And I think you're very familiar with what's happened down there. There was a vote, there was the recount and then there's been a series of legal actions that have taken place since that time.  What we know is that all parties in Guyana want to progress this development. Of course, we're in regular contact with both President Granger and the APNU+AFC coalition, and we're also in discussions with the PPP and Jagdeo and Irfan Ali. And what we continue to stress to the government is that if the project does get delayed, it's a loss of value to the country, and they understand that. It's very, very clear the government understands that. It's very, very clear, the Ministry of Energy understands that. It's very important that we get this development plan so that we can FID in the September time frame. There are weather conditions that if you meet -- miss a certain window, it could result in delay of some months, and that's what we're trying to work towards. I'm confident this will get resolved, but Doug, it's -- we need that approval of the development plan, and that's what governments have to do. And obviously, we'll work with them. And as I said, we're ready to go.\nDouglas Leggate: And thanks for the restatement on the dividend.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, yes. And I appreciate it. Good to hear from you, Doug.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: The first question I had was around the dividend. And I think, Neil, your comments there was -- this is an imperative for you guys to defend. Can you just talk about the business logic and the financial logic behind defending the dividend, especially in light of some of the dividend reductions we've seen and are likely to be upcoming from your competitors?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. I mean we see it this way. And Neil, I'd tell you our capital allocation priorities, as I said in my prepared comments, they're unchanged, and I don't think you'd expect anything different. I always see the 3 legs of a stool. It's a commodity business, so you've got to invest in advantaged projects. You've got to invest in accretive projects. That's the way to sustain a strong foundation and to generate future cash flows.  But of course, the business is cyclical. We know that. It's volatile. We all know that. That's the norm, and therefore, it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And that's what we've done for years. It enables us to sustain through the commodity cycle. It enabled us to work through this quarter. And that's really, really important.  But third, we have a long history in this corporation of providing this reliable, and I would tell you, and as you know, growing dividend for 37 years. A large portion of our shareholder base, I mean, Stephen may correct me, but I think something like 70% of our shareholder base of retail investors.\nStephen Littleton: That's correct.\nNeil Chapman: And the investor sets come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income, and that's something we take really, really seriously. So we manage this capital allocation priorities over a long term. But obviously, it's a balance. And obviously, we recognize the need to balance in the near term to respond to what we've seen in these market conditions and market environment. And that's why we've had the cuts in CapEx and OpEx, and that's why we took on more debt in the last 4 months to a level that we feel is appropriate to provide liquidity, given the uncertainties of the market.  But as I said, we don't plan to take on any more debt. We're now developing plans that will able us to maintain those capital allocation priorities over the near term, and that includes sustaining the dividend. And our plans contemplate a price environment that's consistent with third parties. Of course, we look at sensitivities on the upside and the downside of that, and we are aware of what those will be. And that is why we are moving on further reduction of operating expenses and further short-term, short-term reductions in capital expenditure. That will enable us to maintain the dividend, and that will enable us to hold our debt to current levels.  Now, Neil, I mean you're well aware, we can't know with certainty how the market will evolve from here. There's too many unknowns, of course. So you have to maintain a degree of flexibility to be able to respond should the recovery not play out as expected. But I -- we feel very confident that we will be able to maintain that level of debt and maintain that dividend, certainly for the coming year or months.\nNeil Mehta: Great. And I'm sorry to keep on going back to the capital spending question. I did think that is an incremental point of disclosure, so I just want to clarify some things here. So Neil, are you saying that at the end of the year, your fourth quarter annualized headline CapEx, not cash CapEx, will be $19 billion? And then in 2021, you anticipate you will be below that, all else equal right now? And then can you just talk about the buckets where you could see some downside relative to the plan that you had outlined?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Yes. Well, you are correct. That is what I said. In the fourth quarter, we expect to be at an annual running rate of $19 billion. And what I said was, I expect, I anticipate we'll be lower than that $19 billion in 2021. Of course, we have an annual plan process. That's the way we work in this company. And we ultimately review that plan with our Board of Directors in November, and that will be finalized. And that's why I'm always saying I expect we will do that. We'll finalize the plan ultimately with the directors, and we'll communicate that to you at that time.  I think in terms of where we're taking those cuts, clearly, the short cycle in the unconventional space is the way you can turn on capital and turn off capital relatively quickly. And so the quickest cuts and the largest cuts we've made, as we've discussed, has been in the unconventional space, not just in the Permian. I tell you it is across all the unconventional space, and that will continue.  In the Downstream and Chemical projects, it's really a question of deferral. So we're not stopping any of these projects. We're deferring them. We're postponing them. And we're working with our partners, and we're working with EPC contractors, and we're working with local authorities. And that is why we've not been specific at this stage which project we're deferring over what period and when. When we have clarity with all of our partners, of course, we will share that with you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.\nDouglas Terreson: Neil, economic value-added or EVA for ExxonMobil, and really every super major peer has declined steadily during the past decade or so even though we've had a range of commodity prices and margins. And we're now seeing the stocks of the super majors falling to 3- and 4-decade lows versus S&P 500. And on this point, one read could be that companies are investing cyclically or countercyclically, which I think is you all's view despite secular deteriorating -- or deterioration in competitive conditions that is a decline in value creation that we've seen.  So two questions. First question is, how do you think about the secular/cyclical risk part and the implications for spending? And then second, with ExxonMobil stock at a 40-year low versus S&P 500, why wouldn't this argue for additional transformation of the company's business structure, financial metrics, executive pay incentives or whatever you think is important? Or do you think that the current plan is sufficient and it will eventually accomplish the objective? So what's the market missing here?\nNeil Chapman: We can discuss this for a long time, Doug. So I'll try and be succinct. Look, in terms of how do we think about this business, we don't think the long term has changed. It is a cyclical business. The fundamentals are not -- have not changed. The population will continue to grow. Economies will continue to grow. This relationship between societal progress or you can describe it as human development and energy consumption is absolutely clear, and the demand for energy by all third parties is going to be up 25% by 2040. So we don't see that's changed.  And in our business, of course, which is a depletion business, it's not just a question of the growth in demand. It's the depletion as well, which, as you know, demand for crude oil -- and again, I apologize, I don't know these numbers exactly right. It's about 0.7% annual growth, and gas is probably 1.3%, but the depletion is about 6%. So there is a need for hydrocarbons to come into the market and people to invest in hydrocarbons to meet that energy demand. And the winner, the winner will be the company with the strongest portfolio and the company with the strongest operating results. And that's what we've been discussing at our last, however many, 3 investor meetings. And of course, we've talked about and be very, very quick, we've got the strongest set of development opportunities in the Upstream, and we've got the most -- we've got one of the most aggressive divestment programs, and we're driving costs out of the business. In the Downstream, we're not focused on growing fuels, we're focused on upgrading fuels, basically to distillate with diesel jet fuel and base stocks to meet that market demand. And of course in Chemicals, chemical demand, which is growing fast, is driven by this growth in middle class, and we feel very well positioned in that business. So I don't see anything changing. There's no evidence that anything is changing to any of that. I mean that is for sure.  In terms of what do we need to do and should we be doing more, I would tell you, Doug, that's what we're focused on. You only win in this commodity business if you have the lowest cost structure, and driving costs out of your business and upgrading your portfolio is what this business is all about.  In terms of some of the comments around executive compensation and in terms of workforce reduction, of course, we're looking at every element of that, as you would imagine, when we go through a quarter like that. But I would tell you, we were already looking at all of this, and we started that process as we reorganized this company back in, I guess, 2018 and 2019 with our big changes in organization structure in both the Upstream and Downstream. So I would tell you, in my opinion, we're looking for structural efficiencies to improve this portfolio to be the most competitive in an industry and in a business where we believe the long-term fundamentals are not changed, and we don't see any evidence that changed at this stage.\nStephen Littleton: I guess, Neil, the comment I'd add, as we did the restructuring in the 2 businesses along the value chain construct, what we're able to really identify is the overall cost of delivery of our products. And we're identifying efficiencies across those -- that entire value chain at a rate far higher than we really anticipated, and that's where we're going to start to see additional efficiencies going forward.\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Yes, Stephen is right, Doug. And I would tell you that this evaluation that we're going through as part of this year's plan to set up our cost structure for future years, '21 and beyond, we are looking at very significant efficiencies and lower operating expenses. And I know you're going to ask me, \"Okay, what is the number?\" That is part of our planned process. So we'll share with you at the end of the -- you know what I'm going to say, Doug. But as I said in my comments, we do see the potential for further workforce reductions, including overhead and management positions, but we'll look at that reductions by function, by business, by country, and that will be the basis. We will conclude those plans during the summer months, and we'll review that with the Board in November.\nDouglas Terreson: Okay. So it sounds like we'll hear about kind of an updated plan for potential or normalized earnings that you've provided in the past maybe next spring. Is that a good way to think about it?\nNeil Chapman: Yes, that would be our intent. Yes, that's exactly right. Exactly right.\nOperator: We'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Can you hear me?\nNeil Chapman: Yes, sure.\nRoger Read: I'd like to maybe come at the CapEx question a little different way. Bear with me a second. But as we think about what happened in the post-2014 CapEx cuts, we saw a tremendous amount of improvement in productivity and efficiency and cost reductions just from your contractor/subcontractor universe. Doesn't look like there's the same level of cost cuts that come out on that particular part. So as I think about a CapEx cut from the roughly $30 billion to the sub-$20 billion range, you've mentioned deferrals, but are we going to see a more significant impact on whether it's Exxon or the industry in terms of the ability to bring new oil and gas projects to market as maybe the main result here? I guess what I'm trying to think of is, is this one going to have -- this particular downturn going to have a bigger impact on the industry's deliverability? You kind of touched on that on the intro beyond, just interested in getting your thoughts on that.\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Well, I think, look, it is -- when you look across the industry, and we read the same reports that you do, and there's been a dramatic cutback in our industry on capital expenditure. And history says there is a result of that. This is a depletion business. I mean we all know what happens when you don't invest in this business, it certainly suggests that will be the case this time around. But obviously, I can only really talk about what we are doing and why.  We're taking these short-term steps while preserving the long-term value. That is our objective. I would tell you that we are working very hard with the contractors, the material suppliers on every angle to drive further efficiencies and costs out. The contracting industry is hungry because there's been so much CapEx taken out of the business, and people have suspended and postponed so many projects. So we're working very, very hard. And I have to tell you, in the Downstream, Chemicals and Upstream, I am -- well, first of all, I'm really pleased how well the EPC contractors are working with us. It is a great -- it illustrates the great partnership we have with them. And jointly, we're taking efficiencies, and we're offsetting the cost of these deferrals with increased efficiencies. That's what I am seeing, and that's what we're seeing in the business.  In terms of ability, where the industry stops investing, will that impact the long term of the ability to step up and reinvest again? There's always that chance. But experience in a commodity business suggests that when the demand is there, the market will deliver. I don't see any difference here. I am very optimistic, though, that as a result of not just the oil crash in '15, '16, but what we've seen today will fundamentally, will fundamentally push this industry to do things more efficiently and take structural costs out of construction in a way that we have not previously seen.\nRoger Read: Okay. So that's all...\nNeil Chapman: I don't know if that answered your question, Roger.\nRoger Read: I think so. I mean it's always amazing to me just how much productivity and efficiency comes out of the industry whichever the cycle, but especially in these down cycle moments.\nNeil Chapman: Yes. And I would tell you, as a business owner, Roger, it's unbelievably frustrating, right? Because we should gain these efficiencies in the base case. So -- but I agree with you. When times get like this, then it's extraordinary how the industry can find opportunities to do things more efficiently and take more cost out. Sorry, I interrupted your second question.\nRoger Read: No, no, that's quite all right. Second question, shifting gears a little bit back to Guyana that Doug mentioned earlier. Between your partner having their call in this call today in a nearby country, there was another discovery in the deeper zones. Your partner talked about some of the deeper zones. I was just wondering how are you looking at that opportunity and how that fits within the sort of greater than $8 billion of discovered resource so far? Where does it fit in the overall package? What did the Yellowtail-2 really tell you about that and some of the other opportunities?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Well, I think you're probably aware, our latest appraisal well, which was on a prospect we call Yellowtail-2 and we discovered 2. I would tell you that additional high-quality, hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, and that it's very positive for us, and it's very positive for the country and our partners. One was adjacent to Yellowtail and one was below Yellowtail. So that further gives us great confidence and it's more learnings in terms of the potential at lower depths or deeper depths. We're now on a prospect called Redtail. I would anticipate we'll get some initial results in August on Redtail. We're going to move into the Kaieteur Block in August on a prospect called Canje. And of course, subsequent to that, we've got other exploration projects that we're drilling up in later this year, one in Hassa-1 and one in Bulletwood, which is on the Canje Block. If my memory is correct, those are what we're doing.  In terms of Suriname, I think you're aware, we're in Block 59 down there, and we're in Block 52 with our partner, Petronas. And we're looking to drill a well on Block 52 with our partner potentially in the fourth quarter of this year. I think the learnings and the understanding of the whole resource base in that offshore areas, Suriname and Guyana, the more we find and the more we drill, the more we understand about that hole prospects. But I would tell you that everything we've seen this year is consistent with what we've been talking about. And we are very encouraged and very excited by the prospects going forward.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: So belabor the CapEx topic, but something that I think we landed on that's pretty important, especially for investors. In the past, the process of budgeting CapEx was never explicitly tied to your expected sources of cash. And actually, as a matter of fact, the management committee would make it very clear that they were completely decoupled all the time and that just wasn't the right way to run the business. And so I mean do you think it's a fair interpretation of your comments to say that there's a real fundamental change in the way [indiscernible] and that the sort of cash include disposals and other nonoperating factors are now a prominent part of that process, and we should think about it that way? Or is this just a unique circumstance to the moment?\nNeil Chapman: No, I don't think it's a fair way of characterizing it. I mean in the short term, we have elected to do the following. We've elected to take no more debt on because we want to protect the strength of our balance sheet. We want to and we feel a great commitment to our dividend. And so what other knob do you turn when you're in that situation? It's capital expenditure. I see this as a short-term reduction in capital expenditure to manage the current situation. We retain a very competitive balance sheet. I mean you know that. You've seen this. It's very competitive versus our peers, and we want to protect that, and so we're doing that by taking shortcuts and expenses. It doesn't change our fundamental belief that you need a strong balance sheet and you need to invest in the most attractive prospects, the most competitive prospects that are out there. So again, Sam, I don't think it's a fundamental change. I think it's a response to the short-term environment.\nSam Margolin: Okay. And I apologize for belaboring that. I just wanted to clarify. And then on a related note, within this process of high grading for the near term, the focus is to be on Permian, and it seems like the LNG projects may have [indiscernible] LNG sort of tied to some other goals for the company [indiscernible].\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Yes, Sam, we kind of lost you there, but I'm going to say -- I'm going to try and interpret what I heard. It was around LNG and the LNG projects, and you're aware that we have 2 significant opportunities in Mozambique and in Papua New Guinea. I think we're continuing in Papua New Guinea to work with the government on the P'nyang fiscals, and that process is ongoing. We're continuing to work with our partners in Mozambique, both the government and our partners on the timing. I think consistent with what you see in our capital spending and consistent with what you see across the industry, there could be a time component in terms of a delay. You will recall that both those 2 projects, even in 2018, we were talking about them coming online in the '25 -- 2025 type of period. There is a chance that will slip a few years or a little bit of time beyond that. Yes. Sorry, Sam, we lost it. If that wasn't the question you were looking for, that's what I heard.\nSam Margolin: No, I was going to ask if you could tie to in some of the ESG efforts as well. But if I have bad connection, I'll leave it there and ask Stephen later.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Gresh: I guess I'm going to also -- I'm going to ask another follow-up, I suppose, on this topic. But as we look at the current cash balances for the company and your CapEx plans, is there a minimum level of cash that you're, I guess, basing your commentary on that you would not plan to be adding additional debt? And is there anything in there or inorganically and plan around asset sales? Or is that commentary completely organic in nature?  And I guess the bigger picture question is, you're talking a lot about efficiency improvements and lowering costs. So structurally, the $30 billion to $35 billion in CapEx you've talked about, is that something that through efficiency gains and things you believe actually would be lower in the future?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Let me try and address them in order. Asset sales, I mean, but it's not the best environment for selling assets, but I can assure you that we are in the market with multiple assets, and we're progressing asset sales. Whether they will finalize or come to fruition, time will tell. But I think it all depends on what you're selling, what market, what location, what's the age of the asset, et cetera. And so we are extremely active in that space. But I never like to try and predict what will happen in the future of that because it depends on both the buyer and the seller. So -- but we're still progressing.  In terms of cost savings, as I mentioned earlier on and how that impacts CapEx, I'm optimistic that when times get really tough for everybody in that supply chain of project development and project execution, you identify and drive new efficiencies. So you would hope that they can be retained, and you would hope -- and we certainly plan that we'll benefit from those in the long term. Will it change our capital expenditure from $33 billion, which was our original plan for this year, down to $23 million just through savings? I think that's probably a little bit optimistic, frankly. But we do see savings coming out, and we do see savings coming for the long term.  In terms of the cash balance, what we did was we took on more long-term debt over the last 4 months at what we regard is attractive -- certainly relatively attractive prices, but that was to provide more flexibility during this period. And when you're in a volatile period, higher cash is what we wanted to do. And of course, it provides the optionality to reduce short-term debt. But that's all part of our debt management, cash management, capital allocation process.\nStephen Littleton: I guess, Neil, I'd also add, currently, Phil, we have a pretty high cash level given the amount of uncertainty that's out in the market. But if you go back in time, we've historically carried a cash balance in the $5 billion or lower. And so right now, obviously, we're in an unprecedented time, we thought it was appropriate to -- we had the appropriate level of liquidity to manage us through the next couple of quarters just to make sure we see how the recovery is going to respond. But I look back on our history, usually, that cash balance is substantially lower.\nNeil Chapman: Yes.\nPhilip Gresh: Okay. Follow-up question, I suppose it's somewhat related to what Doug Leggate was asking about with respect to sustaining capital. It's just more specific to the Permian. As we look at the exit rate that you're talking about for the rig count and implicitly for capital spending, I think your guidance for this year of 345,000 on production would obviously imply something a bit higher than that as an exit. But are you -- I guess with this $19 billion or less of spending, would that -- should that imply to us that you would let Permian production decline in 2021? Or do you feel that there are levers available to you that, that would not be embedded in that plan?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. I would tell you, let's talk about Permian this year first. Our outlook for this year is pretty close to what I said at Investor Day. I think it's -- again, you'll correct me here, but it's 345,000 Kbd, and so that's about just 15,000 below. And that really reflects, because of the way we are developing the Permian with these large-scale developments and large cube developments. The capital you invest last year has a material impact on the results this year. And so that's why it's only a 15,000 Kbd reduction.  In terms of the following year, we haven't finalized those plans yet. Of course, if there's no investment, these wells decline rapidly. But you're aware that we have a considerable number of DUCs sitting out there. You'll also be aware, it's a much higher cost of frac than it is to drill. And that's really, really important. So just looking at drilling rigs alone doesn't tell you the full story. I don't anticipate that our volumes will reduce next year. We'll finalize that through the plan process. We'll finalize that with our Board in November. And of course, we'll share that with you at the Investor Day in the first quarter next year.\nStephen Littleton: And Neil, if you don't mind, I'll add, I think, Phil, it will also depend on what's the business environment look like, and that's the beauty of the Permian. We'll be able to flex up or down depending on what we see in terms of the market.\nNeil Chapman: Yes.\nPhilip Gresh: Okay. So on the $19 billion, your base case would be -- it would not decline. Is that the conclusion?\nNeil Chapman: Certainly, at a $19 billion capital spending, it would not decline, no.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.\nJason Gammel: While we're on the topic of the Permian, I was hoping that you might be able to address, Neil, what you're seeing on the performance from wells that had been curtailed but are not being brought back online. Are you saying pretty flush production from those wells?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Actually, it's something we looked at very closely when we shut in these wells. We wanted to be sure that when we bring them back online that they come back at what I always describe as the same position on the type curve, and that's indeed what we've seen. We were confident that if we shut in, we'd resume at or above where it left on that decline curve. And Jason, that's what we're seeing.\nJason Gammel: Excellent. Maybe if I could just shift over to the Downstream. You talked about the margin environment still being pretty poor. How are you able to, given the flexibility of your system, shift around product yields? And I'm taking really integration to petrochemicals and being able to more maximize feed into that system and away from fuels. And then also, how are you dealing with jet fuel, just given the significant inventories and lead demand for that product?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. I think, Jason, you have to start with jet fuel, frankly, because of all transportation fuels, jet is obviously lagging the most. From our perspective, it's very clear that's because of the lower international flights. That's the biggest issue. When you produce jet, what are you going to do with it? You've got to push as much jet as you can into the distillate pool, into the diesel pool. And actually, the demand for diesel is quite strong, but the margins are still relatively low, and that's because the refiners are pushing jet in up to the limits of the product quality, pushing jet in there, which is giving, if you like, an oversupply into that jet pool. It is interesting on the diesel or distillate demand.  And just throw a little bit of data, we see U.S. truck vehicle miles back to the pre-COVID levels. That is a really significant point. And so once you see commercial transportation going back to those pre-COVID levels, that is important. But of course, we see passenger vehicles lagging and jet lagging a lot.  In terms of Chemicals, Chemicals is a really interesting story in terms of what's happening in the demand for chemicals. It's very different depending on the products that you're making. If you are making products that's going into the packaging or medical industry, so think things like polyethylene, the demand is very, very strong. And actually, polyethylene demand is up 2% year-to-date. But not all polyethylenes are the same. Some go into packaging and some go into durables and construction, so think of things like pipe, construction pipe in your houses. So it's very, very different. Overall, we see strong demand for products that are going into packaging, medical; weaker demand for products that go into auto and construction. And that's important because it depends what feedstock you put into your steam crackers to make the right products. Of course, over the last quarter, we saw a contraction of the feed advantage between whether you're cracking ethane, which of course is gas, or you're cracking naphtha. There was little differentiation in the second quarter between those feedstocks. And at that time, refiners were putting more and more liquids into their feedstocks.  Certainly, from a U.S. perspective, as this quarter has evolved in the last month or 1.5 months, what you've seen is the advantage for gas, i.e., ethane in the U.S. chemical plants, that advantage has started to open up again, which means more chemical producers are putting more gas in the feedstock of their chemical plants, which means they're backing out naphtha. That's really what's happening.\nOperator: We'll take that from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.\nRyan Todd: Great. Maybe just a couple of quick ones on the downstream. Could you provide some color around the time line for the Beaumont expansion and whether that will be impacted from the timing point of view in terms of what your eventual outlook is for Permian production over the coming years?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. I would tell you, Ryan, as I mentioned earlier on, we're still working with our partners and our EPC contractors in terms of which of these Downstream projects that we are postponing, how long that postponement will be. And we're just not in a position yet to communicate that externally, not because we haven't fund our plans, we're still working with our contractors on that. So in due course, we will give you some further details or more details on that. What I would tell you is there's likely to be a postponement on that, the magnitude of that postponement on that project, and we'll come back to you later on, whether it's months or longer than that.\nStephen Littleton: Neil, if you don't mind, I'd probably add to the fact that if you think about what we're doing at Beaumont, it's really all connected back to what's going on in the Permian. So being able to sync those up is going to be pretty critical longer term.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, it is. It is. Sure.\nRyan Todd: Okay. And then maybe one final one. I mean we've seen -- over the last couple of quarters, we've seen pretty significant impairments from a number of your peers regarding both -- driven by both kind of short-term and long-term pricing assumptions as well as some certain assumptions on carbon transition. I mean can you talk a little bit about where you are in the process of revisiting some of those long-term assumptions? If anything, and in particular, where the oil sands have been hit pretty hard a number of your peers, where the oil sands kind of falls in terms of your long-term views regarding this?\nNeil Chapman: Yes. Yes. No, I appreciate you asking that question. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan. I always start with impairment saying it's really quite difficult to compare between companies on write-offs and impairment. It depends on the quality of the resource. It depends on the carrying costs. It depends on your price margins assumptions. It depends on your development plans. And you also have to put this context on this. There are different accounting rules, as I think you're aware. In Europe, IFRS goes straight to a discounted cash flow. GAAP rules are an undiscounted cash flow. So those are two very significant points, and I would just offer that as background.  For us, in addition to our normal monitoring for impairments throughout the year, we follow a very rigorous process each year following those GAAP accounting rules. It is part of our annual plan process. During that process, we refresh our views for long-term demand and supply and industry conditions each year. We look at that supply outlook. We look at the cost of supply for oil and gas. That drives the supply/demand outlook. That informs our view on prices. And as I've said previously, and we have said previously, our prices are generally within the range of third-party assessments. We are going through that work now on pricing, and we have not finished that work. When we have finished that work, we will review it with our Board, of course.  But again, as we have seen previously, what we're seeing so far, it is in line with third-party assessments. As part of that process and as part of that plan process, we look at the development plans for all of our resource base, and that would, of course, include oil sands. And the key part here is when we plan to develop each resource. And when we've completed that work, if changes to our long-term views on prices or if changes to our development plans are sufficient, then we'll follow the normal test for impairment. And that's the process we follow. We're following that process this year, and that process will be finalized with a Board review in November. Does that answer your question?\nRyan Todd: Yes.\nNeil Chapman: Okay.\nStephen Littleton: Well, we want to thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight second quarter results and the decisive actions we are taking to manage through these challenging times and position ourselves for the eventual recovery. We appreciate your interest, and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, and please be safe.\nNeil Chapman: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Neil Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks, Stephen. It's great to be on the call this morning. I hope that all of you joining us and your families are safe and healthy, and I want to extend the gratitude of everyone here at ExxonMobil to all of the men and women working on the front lines to fight the virus and to help those suffering from its effects. I'd also like to thank our employees for all that they are doing to support the response efforts globally.  As we indicated during the first quarter, we anticipated the COVID pandemic and related economic shutdowns would significantly impact the financial performance of companies across multiple sectors in the second quarter, and we've seen that reflected in the results announced to date. As Stephen just discussed, the same external factors were evident in our second quarter earnings and cash flows. However, there's reason to be encouraged that we may have seen the trough in April when WTI hit a historic low point and then began to rebound as economic activity picked up and demand showed signs of increasing. By the end of the quarter, WTI had risen to around $40 per barrel, with Brent trading slightly above that, and oil prices have remained relatively stable at that level in recent weeks.  I'd like to begin with a few overarching comments on one of the most challenging quarters this industry has seen. We have acted quickly and decisively while preserving long-term value. The organization has responded with a level of commitment and professionalism that has been exceptional. We rapidly adjusted our plans and asked the organization to deliver on very aggressive new targets. They have delivered. Through all of the challenges this environment has presented, we have safely maintained the integrity and continuity of our operations while also making the necessary adjustments to COVID-19 to provide a safe work environment for our workforce and support global response efforts. This success should not be underestimated. Essentially all of our global facilities, Upstream, Downstream and Chemical, have operated without interruption. You can imagine the challenge of maintaining a virus-free environment on offshore platforms and refineries, where our workforce live and work in close proximity. We've had to charge planes to move our rotating operating staff all over the globe without the availability of commercial planes. We've had to lease hotels in multiple cities to quarantine our folks before they start their 30-day rotations. Our organization's ingenuity has been remarkable.  We've responded quickly to the rapidly changing price and margin environment by shutting in facilities when necessary and capturing value from the rapidly changing prices, leveraging our extensive supply chains around the world. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made reducing costs and pacing investments to adjust to the market conditions. As Stephen described, we set very aggressive operating and capital expense targets. The organization is exceeding those targets, which positions us very well for the rest of the year. We ended the quarter with more than $12.5 billion of cash, which is in line with the business needs. Given this level of liquidity, we don't see a need to take on additional debt.  Before I dive into the business, I want to highlight some of the amazing work our people have done in response to the COVID pandemic. These efforts included reconfiguring manufacturing operations, optimizing processes and delivery systems, enabling us to increase production of essential chemicals that are critical to the world's medical response, including isopropyl alcohol for hand sanitizer and specialty polypropylene for masks and medical garments. Our people have stepped up to contribute educational supplies to schools, fuel and PPE for first responders and financial support to food banks and many other related causes. If you haven't already, I encourage you to visit our website to see all of the inspiring ways our employees have contributed during this time of need.  Now I'll turn to what we're seeing in the markets. Consistent with oil prices reaching historic lows, our own retail sales reflect a bottoming of transportation fuel demand in April, followed by some encouraging signs of recovery. The shape of the recovery varies by region, though the demand in Asia recently surpassed where it was a year ago. This data is from the International Energy Agency. What we saw was a historic demand contraction for transportation fuels with countries around the world impacted at nearly the same time, but we are seeing a recovery from the recent lows. Reflecting the improving demand trends we're seeing, the IEA's view of the next 18 months is similar to ours. They're forecasting a rebound in road transportation fuels, with fourth quarter 2020 demand expected to be at similar levels to the fourth quarter of the prior year. The recovery in jet fuel demand is likely to be much slower with by far the sharpest reduction in demand and the slowest recovery expected. As you would expect, the impact of lower demand was apparent in the second quarter, the refinery crude throughput, about 15% below 2019 levels. This resulted in pressure on margins, which Stephen discussed a few moments ago.  Looking more broadly at total liquids demand, the second quarter was down about 20% year-on-year, but it's important to note the actual loss of demand was not as severe as some had expected, considering the low end of the range was about 30%. Simply put, the demand distraction in the second quarter was unprecedented in the history of modern oil markets. To put it in context, absolute demand fell to levels we haven't seen in nearly 20 years. We've never seen a decline in this magnitude and pace before, even relative to the historic periods of demand volatility following the global financial crisis and as far back as the 1970s oil and energy crisis. In response to this lower demand, we saw a similarly unprecedented reduction of supply in the second quarter as OPEC+ was down approximately 11 million barrels a day in May and June. North American production shut-ins are estimated to have peaked at more than 2 million barrels per day. However, in line with the extraordinary drop we saw in demand, inventory levels increased to unprecedented levels, and we anticipate it will be well into 2021 before the overhang is cleared and we return to pre-pandemic levels.  As mentioned, clearly, the industry has taken significant steps to reduce production. We have taken decisive action in this regard as well. Curtailment impacts in the quarter were about 330,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Roughly 2/3 of these volumes were economic curtailments in unconventional and heavy oil. We brought the majority of production from our shorter-cycle unconventional plays back online in July as market conditions recovered. For our heavy oil assets, we took advantage of the economic curtailments to pull forward planned maintenance. At Kearl, we completed a maintenance shutdown on line 2, and it's now back online. In the middle of July, we shut down line 1 for similar planned maintenance, and this is expected to return to service in late August. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate an impact of approximately 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from curtailments, with about 70% of those mandated by governments.  Turning to the Permian Basin. Second quarter production was nearly 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. That's a 9% increase versus the second quarter of 2019. We continue to anticipate 2020 production will be about 345,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. It's down just 15,000 barrels per day from what we discussed back in March despite the curtailments and the sharp reduction in capital expenditure and still more than 70,000 barrels per day above the full year of 2019. During the quarter, we started up the Delaware Basin central processing and exporting facility, which we refer to as Cowboy. As I discussed in March, this is a key building block in our Poker Lake major development. As we've discussed previously, the short-cycle nature of our Permian assets also provides flexibility to pace development, reduce spend and preserve cash in the current environment. We cut our rig count by about half, ending the quarter with 30 rigs in the Permian Basin, and we expect to cut that number by at least half again by the end of this year. Our activities for the rest of the year will be focused on Poker Lake, where we will continue to leverage our development scale advantage and utilize the above-surface investments that we have pursued in the last 18 months, including Cowboy.  In light of the recent low price environment, we also pushed out the flowback of our largest to date cube development to the third quarter. This is the 27 well cube in the Midland Basin that I referenced at our Investor Day. Again, this decision reflects our focus on making the appropriate decisions to maximize the value of each well and adapt as market conditions become more favorable, including optimize completion timing for our inventory of drilled uncomplete wells.  In Guyana, Liza Phase 1 demonstrated production capacity of 120,000 barrels per day during the quarter. The response to a mechanical issue that we experienced in May was slowed by logistical challenges of mobilizing technical experts and materials in-country due to COVID restrictions. So these are close to being resolved, and we expect to get back to full capacity with 100% gas injection in August.  We're still actively investing for the future in Guyana, with 4 drilling rigs as of the end of June with 1 on exploration and 3 on appraisal and project development drilling. Subsequent to the quarter end, drilling at Yellowtail 2 identified 2 additional high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, 1 adjacent and 1 below the Yellowtail field. Liza Phase 2 remains on schedule for a 2022 start-up. You can see the FPSO in the photo, which is currently in Singapore for the top site integration.  We are continuing to work with the government on approval for the Payara development plan. Without final resolution of the election results and signing in a new government, there is a potential for delays to the schedule. Having said that, it's very clear that all parties in-country understand the importance of progressing the developments quickly given the significant benefits to all stakeholders, especially the citizens of Guyana.  Let's now turn to the progress we're making on the aggressive cost reduction measures we put in place earlier this year, starting with capital expenditures. In April, we reduced our plan for this year by 30% to $23 billion. We're on pace to meet or exceed that target. In fact, our annualized run rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be around $19 billion, and we expect to be lower still in 2021. Savings during the second quarter were primarily driven by short-cycle unconventional activity, but I should note that we're also adjusting the pace of other investments in all of our businesses. As we previously mentioned, we continue to take a very thoughtful and comprehensive approach to these cost reductions in partnership with our contractors, partners and governments. You will hear me say several times this morning the importance of addressing the short-term market challenges while conserving cash and preserving long-term value and future optionality. This helps us ensure that while investments may be deferred in some areas, the opportunities remain. Given the continued uncertainty and volatility, we will continue to adjust CapEx reductions as needed while also being mindful that the pullback we're seeing across the industry today could very well lay the foundation for supply challenges in the future, and we want to make sure we're positioned to capture the eventual upswing.  In addition to our targeted near-term CapEx reductions, we also laid out plans to reduce cash operating expenses by 15% in 2020. Again, we are delivering. We're ahead of pace to achieve that target, with savings coming from a wide range of activities including lower unconventional activity, optimizing supply chains, lower material and service costs and work process improvements to reduce support and overhead costs. So these are just a few examples. Our savings are widespread across the corporation. More importantly, we're doing it without compromising safety or operational integrity.  Over the past few years, we underwent a reorganization of our businesses from what were primarily functional organization structures to aligning a long value chain. These reorganizations reduce the senior leadership structure and associated overhead and improved the line of sight across the value chains to better drive performance from our assets. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed how this organization has provided a new lens on the business to identify and improve ways to drive further efficiencies. You might recall, Darren made the point that our plan for this year included reducing our operating cost on our base assets by more than $1 billion, and he said that we would do even better in 2021. So we came into the current environment in a good position to respond quickly. We're confident that we will meet or exceed our cost reduction targets for 2020.  Looking ahead to 2021, we see significant potential for additional reductions based on identification of further long-term structural efficiencies, reduced activity levels and an evaluation of our workforce requirements, including the potential for further reductions in overhead and management positions. Our plan is to continue looking at reductions business by business and country by country. Consistent with our annual budgeting process, we're working through these plans, and we would expect to have them finalized during the second half of the year and share them with you early next year.  Let me now address capital allocation. Our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. In a depletion commodity business, you have to invest in accretive advantaged projects to sustain a strong foundation to generate cash flows into the future. In a capital-intensive cyclical business, such as ours, it is critically important to maintain a strong balance sheet. This enables us to sustain through the commodity price cycle and be flexible when opportunities present themselves. It has been a strength of this corporation for decades, and it is an advantage that we will maintain. Finally, we have a long history of providing a reliable and growing dividend. A large portion of our shareholder base has come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income, and we take that very seriously. While we manage our capital allocation priorities over the long term, we also recognize the need to balance in the near term to respond to market conditions. In response to the unprecedented environment that we find ourselves in, we've taken decisive action in 2020.  To recap what we've done so far this year. We've reduced short-term capital spending by more than 30%. We're on pace to reduce cash operating expenses by more than 15%. We've increased debt to a level we feel as appropriate to provide liquidity, given market uncertainties, and we will hold it at that level. And we're continuing to pay a reliable dividend.  Given the ongoing uncertainty in the business environment, we're developing plans that will enable us to maintain our capital allocation priorities over the near term. These plans contemplate a price environment that is consistent with the range of third-party estimates and in line with the shape of the recovery that I discussed moments ago. The plans will include further reducing operating expenses and identifying additional opportunities to efficiently defer more CapEx. Doing so will enable us to maintain the dividend and hold debt at its current level. Of course, this is a volatile market, and we can't know with certainty how the market will evolve from here. There are simply too many unknowns. While we're developing plans based on what we and other third parties can reasonably expect to happen, we have to maintain a certain degree of flexibility to be able to respond to potential improvement or further degradation.  Before we open up the call for questions, I want to reemphasize a few key points. Our people continue to demonstrate a commitment to safety and operational integrity and continuity in an incredibly challenging environment. Our company continues to benefit from the integration advantages we've built across the value chain. We remain focused on driving down costs and pacing investments to manage the near-term market challenges. We've maintained financial capacity in line with our business needs and the market environment. We will continue to be there for the communities and frontline workers who depend on the products and support we can provide to combat the ongoing pandemic. I am confident in our organization and our plans. We will overcome the challenges of the current environment just as we've overcome many challenges in the past.  Thank you, and we look forward to taking your questions. Yes, this is Neil. Thanks for joining the call. Good to hear from you. Of course, as you are aware, in the response to this environment, which clearly has been unprecedented, we've never seen the market demand crash so far, so deep. We've never seen prices and margins crash so much, and that's why having a strong balance sheet is so important. And I would tell you, that's why the financial discipline of this corporation over many, many decades has been so critical. It means you can weather the big storms. It means you can weather the large-scale disruptions. And of course, it also means you can reward the loyalty of our shareholders by sticking with them when the business recovers and sticking with the plans we have in place to protect this balance sheet and maintain our dividend.  As we've just been discussing or describing, we took really, really decisive steps for this year, so the short-term capital spending reduction of 30% to 15% in operating expenses. This is very much in line with what we saw in our April earnings call. You will recall that Darren laid out our plans then. What we said we needed to do at that time, we've done. The results are on track and are in line with our expectations. So we set out the plans for this year with these reductions. We're now developing plans that are going to enable us to maintain our capital allocation priorities over the near term, and these plans contemplate a price environment that's generally consistent with third parties. Of course, we've seen the third-party assessment of the price environment going forward converge, and we're in line with those. Our plans to maintain our debt at the current levels and maintain our dividend include further reductions in operating expenses, and we're working hard to identify additional opportunities to what I always describe as efficiently deferring more CapEx, and that preserves the optionality and the future value that responds to these short-term needs. Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. Well, we remain committed to progressing the structural improvements to our earnings and the cash flow that we've laid out for the last 3 years, but we have to be more selective in pacing those investments in light of the market environment. And of course and as we've described and actually Darren described as well in April, we've completed a thorough review of all of our ongoing investments and our ongoing investment opportunities. But in our business, that means you got to work with the resource owners, you've got to work with the partners, you've got to work with the stakeholders. We've got to identify areas where we can defer spending but conserve cash in the near term and, of course, preserve that long-term value.  What we have done, and I think we've done really successfully, is we've identified market efficiencies, we have identified project synergies that will offset the cost of these deferrals. But there will be impacts. I mean that's for sure. And there will be impact mainly in timing, and that's to the earnings and cash flow potential that we've previously communicated. So it's clear, I think, from our comments and our actions. In the short term, we'll defend the balance sheet, and we'll protect the dividend by taking short-term postponements in capital investments.  In terms of what we will do next year, of course, we're working through that now, and that's part of our annual planning process. And we're working through that now. And as you're well aware, our planned process concludes with a review with our Board of Directors in November. That will be the same this year as it is every year. And when we have clarity on what that capital spend will be next year, of course, we will communicate it to you. As I have mentioned in my comments, my expectation is our capital spending next year will be lower than the fourth quarter run rate.  In terms of M&A and could that provide a different option to -- I mean, Jeanine, of course, we're looking at that all time. We're looking all the time. And if the right opportunity comes up, then we may elect to move on that. But what I would say is, and I said this before and I certainly said it at the Investor Day, we have, I would say, the very richest set of competitive investment opportunities within this company already. I mean I don't think there's a company out there that can compete with that, and so there's no need for us to do an M&A. We don't need to do that. We have very, very attractive investments to make, but we always look at that option. Yes, we can, Doug. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Just to clarify one point. Our run rate of $19 billion is in the fourth quarter, not the second half, just so you're aware. And what I said is I expect, Doug, it will be lower. We will fund all the Guyana opportunities as they come forward. Of course, as we look at our capital spend, we're looking hard at the priorities on them. And Guyana, we will continue to fund, and you're well aware that Liza 2 is in construction. I'm confident we'll move on Payara as well.  In terms of the Permian, one of the great attractions of short cycle is you can take that capital off quickly. And of course, you can put it back on pretty quickly as well. Our current planning is that we will continue to reduce the number of rigs we have out in the Permian through the second half of this year. I think we are about, if I remember the numbers, about 30 rigs in the Permian at the end of the third quarter -- at the end of the second quarter. I would anticipate we'll be in the range of 15, maybe 10 to 15 at the end of the year, and that really is just a short term to manage our current capital planning.  Those rigs that we have in the Permian will be focused on that Poker Lake development. So what we're doing is we're concentrating, we're concentrating our developments in the Permian in that core activity in Poker Lake that we've talked about for the last 2 times, the last 2 Investor Days.  I would tell you in terms of ongoing sustaining capital, I'm always reluctant in our business to put a number to that because as your portfolio changes and as you make divestments, it's not a number to lock in, and I'm really, really reluctant to put a number on that. I would tell you it's somewhat easier in the Chemicals and Downstream businesses. I mean I think an order of magnitude on sustaining capital in those businesses will be in the $2 billion to $4 billion range. But I think in the Upstream, it's more difficult to quantify in that way. Well, Doug, it's really very simple. Everything we and the partners can do to progress Payara on schedule, we are doing and we've done. I've said to our organization many times, we need to be ready to move as soon as the government is ready. And we are ready. We're ready to FID this project, but we need an approved development plan, and that approved development plan needs to come from the government. And all the work with Bayphase and on the development plan, that's been worked for a long, long time. Of course, we're waiting for a resolution, like everybody else, of the election. And I think you're very familiar with what's happened down there. There was a vote, there was the recount and then there's been a series of legal actions that have taken place since that time.  What we know is that all parties in Guyana want to progress this development. Of course, we're in regular contact with both President Granger and the APNU+AFC coalition, and we're also in discussions with the PPP and Jagdeo and Irfan Ali. And what we continue to stress to the government is that if the project does get delayed, it's a loss of value to the country, and they understand that. It's very, very clear the government understands that. It's very, very clear, the Ministry of Energy understands that. It's very important that we get this development plan so that we can FID in the September time frame. There are weather conditions that if you meet -- miss a certain window, it could result in delay of some months, and that's what we're trying to work towards. I'm confident this will get resolved, but Doug, it's -- we need that approval of the development plan, and that's what governments have to do. And obviously, we'll work with them. And as I said, we're ready to go. Yes, yes. And I appreciate it. Good to hear from you, Doug. Yes. I mean we see it this way. And Neil, I'd tell you our capital allocation priorities, as I said in my prepared comments, they're unchanged, and I don't think you'd expect anything different. I always see the 3 legs of a stool. It's a commodity business, so you've got to invest in advantaged projects. You've got to invest in accretive projects. That's the way to sustain a strong foundation and to generate future cash flows.  But of course, the business is cyclical. We know that. It's volatile. We all know that. That's the norm, and therefore, it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And that's what we've done for years. It enables us to sustain through the commodity cycle. It enabled us to work through this quarter. And that's really, really important.  But third, we have a long history in this corporation of providing this reliable, and I would tell you, and as you know, growing dividend for 37 years. A large portion of our shareholder base, I mean, Stephen may correct me, but I think something like 70% of our shareholder base of retail investors. And the investor sets come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income, and that's something we take really, really seriously. So we manage this capital allocation priorities over a long term. But obviously, it's a balance. And obviously, we recognize the need to balance in the near term to respond to what we've seen in these market conditions and market environment. And that's why we've had the cuts in CapEx and OpEx, and that's why we took on more debt in the last 4 months to a level that we feel is appropriate to provide liquidity, given the uncertainties of the market.  But as I said, we don't plan to take on any more debt. We're now developing plans that will able us to maintain those capital allocation priorities over the near term, and that includes sustaining the dividend. And our plans contemplate a price environment that's consistent with third parties. Of course, we look at sensitivities on the upside and the downside of that, and we are aware of what those will be. And that is why we are moving on further reduction of operating expenses and further short-term, short-term reductions in capital expenditure. That will enable us to maintain the dividend, and that will enable us to hold our debt to current levels.  Now, Neil, I mean you're well aware, we can't know with certainty how the market will evolve from here. There's too many unknowns, of course. So you have to maintain a degree of flexibility to be able to respond should the recovery not play out as expected. But I -- we feel very confident that we will be able to maintain that level of debt and maintain that dividend, certainly for the coming year or months. Yes. Yes. Well, you are correct. That is what I said. In the fourth quarter, we expect to be at an annual running rate of $19 billion. And what I said was, I expect, I anticipate we'll be lower than that $19 billion in 2021. Of course, we have an annual plan process. That's the way we work in this company. And we ultimately review that plan with our Board of Directors in November, and that will be finalized. And that's why I'm always saying I expect we will do that. We'll finalize the plan ultimately with the directors, and we'll communicate that to you at that time.  I think in terms of where we're taking those cuts, clearly, the short cycle in the unconventional space is the way you can turn on capital and turn off capital relatively quickly. And so the quickest cuts and the largest cuts we've made, as we've discussed, has been in the unconventional space, not just in the Permian. I tell you it is across all the unconventional space, and that will continue.  In the Downstream and Chemical projects, it's really a question of deferral. So we're not stopping any of these projects. We're deferring them. We're postponing them. And we're working with our partners, and we're working with EPC contractors, and we're working with local authorities. And that is why we've not been specific at this stage which project we're deferring over what period and when. When we have clarity with all of our partners, of course, we will share that with you. We can discuss this for a long time, Doug. So I'll try and be succinct. Look, in terms of how do we think about this business, we don't think the long term has changed. It is a cyclical business. The fundamentals are not -- have not changed. The population will continue to grow. Economies will continue to grow. This relationship between societal progress or you can describe it as human development and energy consumption is absolutely clear, and the demand for energy by all third parties is going to be up 25% by 2040. So we don't see that's changed.  And in our business, of course, which is a depletion business, it's not just a question of the growth in demand. It's the depletion as well, which, as you know, demand for crude oil -- and again, I apologize, I don't know these numbers exactly right. It's about 0.7% annual growth, and gas is probably 1.3%, but the depletion is about 6%. So there is a need for hydrocarbons to come into the market and people to invest in hydrocarbons to meet that energy demand. And the winner, the winner will be the company with the strongest portfolio and the company with the strongest operating results. And that's what we've been discussing at our last, however many, 3 investor meetings. And of course, we've talked about and be very, very quick, we've got the strongest set of development opportunities in the Upstream, and we've got the most -- we've got one of the most aggressive divestment programs, and we're driving costs out of the business. In the Downstream, we're not focused on growing fuels, we're focused on upgrading fuels, basically to distillate with diesel jet fuel and base stocks to meet that market demand. And of course in Chemicals, chemical demand, which is growing fast, is driven by this growth in middle class, and we feel very well positioned in that business. So I don't see anything changing. There's no evidence that anything is changing to any of that. I mean that is for sure.  In terms of what do we need to do and should we be doing more, I would tell you, Doug, that's what we're focused on. You only win in this commodity business if you have the lowest cost structure, and driving costs out of your business and upgrading your portfolio is what this business is all about.  In terms of some of the comments around executive compensation and in terms of workforce reduction, of course, we're looking at every element of that, as you would imagine, when we go through a quarter like that. But I would tell you, we were already looking at all of this, and we started that process as we reorganized this company back in, I guess, 2018 and 2019 with our big changes in organization structure in both the Upstream and Downstream. So I would tell you, in my opinion, we're looking for structural efficiencies to improve this portfolio to be the most competitive in an industry and in a business where we believe the long-term fundamentals are not changed, and we don't see any evidence that changed at this stage. Yes. Yes, Stephen is right, Doug. And I would tell you that this evaluation that we're going through as part of this year's plan to set up our cost structure for future years, '21 and beyond, we are looking at very significant efficiencies and lower operating expenses. And I know you're going to ask me, \"Okay, what is the number?\" That is part of our planned process. So we'll share with you at the end of the -- you know what I'm going to say, Doug. But as I said in my comments, we do see the potential for further workforce reductions, including overhead and management positions, but we'll look at that reductions by function, by business, by country, and that will be the basis. We will conclude those plans during the summer months, and we'll review that with the Board in November. Yes, that would be our intent. Yes, that's exactly right. Exactly right. Yes, sure. Yes. Well, I think, look, it is -- when you look across the industry, and we read the same reports that you do, and there's been a dramatic cutback in our industry on capital expenditure. And history says there is a result of that. This is a depletion business. I mean we all know what happens when you don't invest in this business, it certainly suggests that will be the case this time around. But obviously, I can only really talk about what we are doing and why.  We're taking these short-term steps while preserving the long-term value. That is our objective. I would tell you that we are working very hard with the contractors, the material suppliers on every angle to drive further efficiencies and costs out. The contracting industry is hungry because there's been so much CapEx taken out of the business, and people have suspended and postponed so many projects. So we're working very, very hard. And I have to tell you, in the Downstream, Chemicals and Upstream, I am -- well, first of all, I'm really pleased how well the EPC contractors are working with us. It is a great -- it illustrates the great partnership we have with them. And jointly, we're taking efficiencies, and we're offsetting the cost of these deferrals with increased efficiencies. That's what I am seeing, and that's what we're seeing in the business.  In terms of ability, where the industry stops investing, will that impact the long term of the ability to step up and reinvest again? There's always that chance. But experience in a commodity business suggests that when the demand is there, the market will deliver. I don't see any difference here. I am very optimistic, though, that as a result of not just the oil crash in '15, '16, but what we've seen today will fundamentally, will fundamentally push this industry to do things more efficiently and take structural costs out of construction in a way that we have not previously seen. I don't know if that answered your question, Roger. Yes. And I would tell you, as a business owner, Roger, it's unbelievably frustrating, right? Because we should gain these efficiencies in the base case. So -- but I agree with you. When times get like this, then it's extraordinary how the industry can find opportunities to do things more efficiently and take more cost out. Sorry, I interrupted your second question. Yes. Well, I think you're probably aware, our latest appraisal well, which was on a prospect we call Yellowtail-2 and we discovered 2. I would tell you that additional high-quality, hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, and that it's very positive for us, and it's very positive for the country and our partners. One was adjacent to Yellowtail and one was below Yellowtail. So that further gives us great confidence and it's more learnings in terms of the potential at lower depths or deeper depths. We're now on a prospect called Redtail. I would anticipate we'll get some initial results in August on Redtail. We're going to move into the Kaieteur Block in August on a prospect called Canje. And of course, subsequent to that, we've got other exploration projects that we're drilling up in later this year, one in Hassa-1 and one in Bulletwood, which is on the Canje Block. If my memory is correct, those are what we're doing.  In terms of Suriname, I think you're aware, we're in Block 59 down there, and we're in Block 52 with our partner, Petronas. And we're looking to drill a well on Block 52 with our partner potentially in the fourth quarter of this year. I think the learnings and the understanding of the whole resource base in that offshore areas, Suriname and Guyana, the more we find and the more we drill, the more we understand about that hole prospects. But I would tell you that everything we've seen this year is consistent with what we've been talking about. And we are very encouraged and very excited by the prospects going forward. No, I don't think it's a fair way of characterizing it. I mean in the short term, we have elected to do the following. We've elected to take no more debt on because we want to protect the strength of our balance sheet. We want to and we feel a great commitment to our dividend. And so what other knob do you turn when you're in that situation? It's capital expenditure. I see this as a short-term reduction in capital expenditure to manage the current situation. We retain a very competitive balance sheet. I mean you know that. You've seen this. It's very competitive versus our peers, and we want to protect that, and so we're doing that by taking shortcuts and expenses. It doesn't change our fundamental belief that you need a strong balance sheet and you need to invest in the most attractive prospects, the most competitive prospects that are out there. So again, Sam, I don't think it's a fundamental change. I think it's a response to the short-term environment. Yes. Yes, Sam, we kind of lost you there, but I'm going to say -- I'm going to try and interpret what I heard. It was around LNG and the LNG projects, and you're aware that we have 2 significant opportunities in Mozambique and in Papua New Guinea. I think we're continuing in Papua New Guinea to work with the government on the P'nyang fiscals, and that process is ongoing. We're continuing to work with our partners in Mozambique, both the government and our partners on the timing. I think consistent with what you see in our capital spending and consistent with what you see across the industry, there could be a time component in terms of a delay. You will recall that both those 2 projects, even in 2018, we were talking about them coming online in the '25 -- 2025 type of period. There is a chance that will slip a few years or a little bit of time beyond that. Yes. Sorry, Sam, we lost it. If that wasn't the question you were looking for, that's what I heard. Yes. Let me try and address them in order. Asset sales, I mean, but it's not the best environment for selling assets, but I can assure you that we are in the market with multiple assets, and we're progressing asset sales. Whether they will finalize or come to fruition, time will tell. But I think it all depends on what you're selling, what market, what location, what's the age of the asset, et cetera. And so we are extremely active in that space. But I never like to try and predict what will happen in the future of that because it depends on both the buyer and the seller. So -- but we're still progressing.  In terms of cost savings, as I mentioned earlier on and how that impacts CapEx, I'm optimistic that when times get really tough for everybody in that supply chain of project development and project execution, you identify and drive new efficiencies. So you would hope that they can be retained, and you would hope -- and we certainly plan that we'll benefit from those in the long term. Will it change our capital expenditure from $33 billion, which was our original plan for this year, down to $23 million just through savings? I think that's probably a little bit optimistic, frankly. But we do see savings coming out, and we do see savings coming for the long term.  In terms of the cash balance, what we did was we took on more long-term debt over the last 4 months at what we regard is attractive -- certainly relatively attractive prices, but that was to provide more flexibility during this period. And when you're in a volatile period, higher cash is what we wanted to do. And of course, it provides the optionality to reduce short-term debt. But that's all part of our debt management, cash management, capital allocation process. Yes. Yes. I would tell you, let's talk about Permian this year first. Our outlook for this year is pretty close to what I said at Investor Day. I think it's -- again, you'll correct me here, but it's 345,000 Kbd, and so that's about just 15,000 below. And that really reflects, because of the way we are developing the Permian with these large-scale developments and large cube developments. The capital you invest last year has a material impact on the results this year. And so that's why it's only a 15,000 Kbd reduction.  In terms of the following year, we haven't finalized those plans yet. Of course, if there's no investment, these wells decline rapidly. But you're aware that we have a considerable number of DUCs sitting out there. You'll also be aware, it's a much higher cost of frac than it is to drill. And that's really, really important. So just looking at drilling rigs alone doesn't tell you the full story. I don't anticipate that our volumes will reduce next year. We'll finalize that through the plan process. We'll finalize that with our Board in November. And of course, we'll share that with you at the Investor Day in the first quarter next year. Yes. Certainly, at a $19 billion capital spending, it would not decline, no. Yes. Actually, it's something we looked at very closely when we shut in these wells. We wanted to be sure that when we bring them back online that they come back at what I always describe as the same position on the type curve, and that's indeed what we've seen. We were confident that if we shut in, we'd resume at or above where it left on that decline curve. And Jason, that's what we're seeing. Yes. I think, Jason, you have to start with jet fuel, frankly, because of all transportation fuels, jet is obviously lagging the most. From our perspective, it's very clear that's because of the lower international flights. That's the biggest issue. When you produce jet, what are you going to do with it? You've got to push as much jet as you can into the distillate pool, into the diesel pool. And actually, the demand for diesel is quite strong, but the margins are still relatively low, and that's because the refiners are pushing jet in up to the limits of the product quality, pushing jet in there, which is giving, if you like, an oversupply into that jet pool. It is interesting on the diesel or distillate demand.  And just throw a little bit of data, we see U.S. truck vehicle miles back to the pre-COVID levels. That is a really significant point. And so once you see commercial transportation going back to those pre-COVID levels, that is important. But of course, we see passenger vehicles lagging and jet lagging a lot.  In terms of Chemicals, Chemicals is a really interesting story in terms of what's happening in the demand for chemicals. It's very different depending on the products that you're making. If you are making products that's going into the packaging or medical industry, so think things like polyethylene, the demand is very, very strong. And actually, polyethylene demand is up 2% year-to-date. But not all polyethylenes are the same. Some go into packaging and some go into durables and construction, so think of things like pipe, construction pipe in your houses. So it's very, very different. Overall, we see strong demand for products that are going into packaging, medical; weaker demand for products that go into auto and construction. And that's important because it depends what feedstock you put into your steam crackers to make the right products. Of course, over the last quarter, we saw a contraction of the feed advantage between whether you're cracking ethane, which of course is gas, or you're cracking naphtha. There was little differentiation in the second quarter between those feedstocks. And at that time, refiners were putting more and more liquids into their feedstocks.  Certainly, from a U.S. perspective, as this quarter has evolved in the last month or 1.5 months, what you've seen is the advantage for gas, i.e., ethane in the U.S. chemical plants, that advantage has started to open up again, which means more chemical producers are putting more gas in the feedstock of their chemical plants, which means they're backing out naphtha. That's really what's happening. Yes. I would tell you, Ryan, as I mentioned earlier on, we're still working with our partners and our EPC contractors in terms of which of these Downstream projects that we are postponing, how long that postponement will be. And we're just not in a position yet to communicate that externally, not because we haven't fund our plans, we're still working with our contractors on that. So in due course, we will give you some further details or more details on that. What I would tell you is there's likely to be a postponement on that, the magnitude of that postponement on that project, and we'll come back to you later on, whether it's months or longer than that. Yes, it is. It is. Sure. Yes. Yes. No, I appreciate you asking that question. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan. I always start with impairment saying it's really quite difficult to compare between companies on write-offs and impairment. It depends on the quality of the resource. It depends on the carrying costs. It depends on your price margins assumptions. It depends on your development plans. And you also have to put this context on this. There are different accounting rules, as I think you're aware. In Europe, IFRS goes straight to a discounted cash flow. GAAP rules are an undiscounted cash flow. So those are two very significant points, and I would just offer that as background.  For us, in addition to our normal monitoring for impairments throughout the year, we follow a very rigorous process each year following those GAAP accounting rules. It is part of our annual plan process. During that process, we refresh our views for long-term demand and supply and industry conditions each year. We look at that supply outlook. We look at the cost of supply for oil and gas. That drives the supply/demand outlook. That informs our view on prices. And as I've said previously, and we have said previously, our prices are generally within the range of third-party assessments. We are going through that work now on pricing, and we have not finished that work. When we have finished that work, we will review it with our Board, of course.  But again, as we have seen previously, what we're seeing so far, it is in line with third-party assessments. As part of that process and as part of that plan process, we look at the development plans for all of our resource base, and that would, of course, include oil sands. And the key part here is when we plan to develop each resource. And when we've completed that work, if changes to our long-term views on prices or if changes to our development plans are sufficient, then we'll follow the normal test for impairment. And that's the process we follow. We're following that process this year, and that process will be finalized with a Board review in November. Does that answer your question? Okay. Thanks, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in Exxon Mobil. As a quick introduction, my name is Stephen Littleton. I assumed the role of Vice President of Investor Relations on March 15. Joining me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO Darren Woods. Before discussing our results, I would like to express our hope that all of you listening and your families are safe and taking the appropriate steps to fight the coronavirus. These are challenging and unprecedented times as the world deals with and adapts to the coronavirus pandemic. Global economies have slowed down significantly as governments work to contain the disease. During the call today, we will put our results into context and share with you how our business performed in the first quarter. After I cover the quarterly, financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives reflecting on the broader market environment and steps we're taking to both respond to these challenges and ensure we remain well positioned for the recovery. Following Darren's remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results, while Darren will be available to take your question on broader themes, including the corporation's actions related to COVID, progress on major growth projects, strategic priorities and views on market fundamentals. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and supplemental information at the end of this presentation. As referenced in the cautionary statement, please take note that in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced spending plans, we've put in place many of the forward-looking statements from our Investor Day have changed. We will provide a perspective on updates during this call and will provide a longer-term perspective as we head into next year. I'll now highlight developments since the fourth quarter on the next slide. In the Upstream, liquids realizations fell significantly through the quarter, approximately 55%, as impacts from the coronavirus rippled through the global economy significantly reducing demand. From an operational standpoint liquids production increased by 2% from the fourth quarter leading to the highest quarterly liquids production since 2016, including a 15% increase in liquids from the Permian. If we look at total production from the Permian, it has increased by 20%. Kearl achieved record production in the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of the investment in additional ore crushing capacity, which will further reduce unit costs. Offshore Brazil, the Uirapuru exploration well discovered hydrocarbons and results are now being analyzed to inform further exploration activities. In the Downstream, refining margins fell to similar levels as first quarter 2019 and remain near 10-year lows with the COVID impact significantly reducing demand in March. Refinery utilization was essentially flat with lower maintenance levels than the prior quarter largely offset by reduced demand. Margins improved in the Chemical business benefiting from lower liquids feedstock prices. Our employees have stepped up in a significant way to support the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts. Darren will provide additional details on how we are maximizing production of key products, redirecting shareholder contributions and lending our technical expertise to aid healthcare workers, first responders and others in the fight against the coronavirus. Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative to fourth quarter 2019. For context, let me walk you through the impact of the identified items. Starting with the fourth quarter 2019. The results of $5.7 billion included identified items of $3.9 billion, notably the Norway divestment. Excluding these items, fourth quarter results were $1.8 billion. Despite this challenging environment, the underlying business results, excluding identified items were $2.3 billion, up $500 million from the fourth quarter. As shown in the middle section of this table, liquids growth and lower operating expenses increased earnings, while the absence of year-end LIFO impacts was a partial offset. U.S. GAAP first quarter earnings of a negative $600 million include the impacts of two separate non-cash identified items. The first was an adjustment to inventory valuation. Given the significant drop in commodity prices in the first quarter, the book value of our inventory was adjusted downward to reflect the lower market values in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This lower cost of market adjustment resulted in a charge of $2.1 billion. It is important to note that we may see further adjustments during the year or potentially an unwinding of the first quarter impact depending on changes in commodity prices going forward. The second item was related to impairments of about $800 million. Market conditions in the first quarter which included significant reductions in both commodity prices and equity markets required an assessment of carrying values for some assets. This evaluation resulted in noncash impairment charges of approximately $800 million to recognize reduced market values assigned to goodwill and an upstream equity company again consistent with U.S. GAAP. Turning now to slide five, we'll look at each of our businesses in detail excluding identified items I just discussed starting with the Upstream. Upstream earnings excluding identified items decreased by approximately $1 billion, largely driven by lower prices which reduced earnings by more than $1.7 billion with liquid realizations down 25% and gas realizations down 10% versus the fourth quarter. This was partly offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts and higher volumes, primarily from strong growth in the Permian and Guyana. Lower expenses and favorable tax items were also a help to earnings. On the next slides, I will provide more details on volumes. Liquids volumes grew by approximately 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter of 2019. Divestments, primarily the Norway non-operated business reduced liquids volumes by 95000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Growth of 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day was underpinned by the Permian and Guyana Phase 1 ramp-up at Kearl and Hebron and the Upper Zakum project in Abu Dhabi. Permian production in the quarter was more than 350,000 oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of 56% versus the prior year or 126,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Natural gas volumes were down 88,000 oil equivalent barrels per day versus the prior quarter, driven by Norway and Mobile Bay divestments as well as lower demand. Moving to Downstream on the next slide, earnings excluding identified items increased by more than $400 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. The absence of year-end LIFO inventory adjustments and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by nearly $700 million. Favorable margin impacts increased earnings by more than $900 million. The increase was driven by positive mark-to-market trading benefits which were partly offset by lower refining margins as demand declined in the quarter particularly in March. We also saw impact related to no demand with COVID-19, but this was more than offset by lower expenses that increased earnings by $300 million. Moving to the next slide, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings excluding identified items increased by more than $800 million with a significant improvement in margins from lower fee costs across the value chain, reflecting the benefit of integration. Additionally, lower expenses contributed approximately 30% of the earnings improvement. Let's turn to the next page for a look at first quarter cash profile. First quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense, non-cash identified items, changes in working capital, and other impacts yielded $6.3 billion in cash flow from operating activities. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.4 billion. Shareholder distributions were $3.7 billion consistent with fourth quarter and leaving $2.7 billion after distributions. First quarter additions to PP&E and net investments and advances were $6.5 billion. As noted in the press release, CapEx was $7.1 billion in the quarter. As the amounts reductions are implemented, CapEx will trim down over the course of the remaining year. Gross debt increased approximately $13 billion in the quarter as we took steps to increase liquidity in the current market environment. As a result, we ended the quarter with $11.4 billion of cash. Turning to slide 11, I will cover a few items for consideration with regards to our outlook for the second quarter. Given the challenging market conditions production will be lower in the second quarter due to economic shut-ins and market-related curtailments. At this time, the estimated second quarter impact is 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Also in the Upstream, natural gas production will be lower due to seasonal demand with an expected impact of approximately 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. In the Downstream, we are seeing impact from reduced demand with continued pressure on refining margins. For the second quarter, we anticipate sparing of approximately 25% of our refining capacity. Scheduled maintenance is anticipated to be in line with levels from the first quarter. In Chemical, we anticipate continued margin support from lower liquids feedstock pricing while noting that overall realizations remain near bottom cycle for many of our products. Sentiment for the second quarter Chemical demand is mixed bearing across product segments. Demand for packaging and hygiene is expected to remain strong, while automotive and durables demand will continue to be challenged. Similar to Downstream scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with the previous quarter. Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $900 million. Finally, we will continue to progress spending reductions in line with our recent announcement. With that I'll turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Stephen and good morning, everybody. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. We certainly appreciate you taking time to join us today. I think we can all agree that these are very challenging times. And I know, I speak for many when I say that our thoughts are with those who have been personally affected by this pandemic with the health care workers and first responders who are on the front lines. This morning, I will discuss how we are approaching the current circumstances and how we are working to keep our people and communities safe managing through the near-term market downturn and preserving long-term shareholder value. As you well know, today we face two acute challenges: a global threat to public health and a significant global economic downturn resulting in a commodity price collapse. What started with an oversupply situation was made more extreme by a sudden and unprecedented drop in energy demand as the economy shut down to stop the spread of the virus. As a capital-intensive commodity business, we certainly weathered the ups and downs of many price cycles. However, I have to say we've never seen anything like what the world is experiencing today. Our response is primarily focused on three areas: protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to provide the critical energy and products that support modern life and the COVID response efforts and aggressively reducing spend in today's depressed markets, while preserving value to ensure we are in the best position for the eventual recovery. I know that there are a lot of different views on what the future holds, but I want to be clear on how we see it. The long-term fundamentals that drive our business have not changed. Despite the current uncertainty and volatility, the fundamentals that underpin our business remains strong. Why do I say that? We know that in the coming decades populations will grow to more than 9 billion people by 2040 up from just over 7 billion today. Billions of people will enter the middle class and seek lifestyles and products that require energy. Economies will expand once again. Of course, there are likely to be some bumps in the road over the short-term, but historically periods of economic contraction are followed by periods of significant growth. Finally as a result of growing populations increased prosperity and economic expansion, energy consumption will increase. Even with the current downturn projections show energy consumption growing by 20% through 2040. Most of the growth will be in developing nations and more than half of that energy demand will be met by oil and natural gas. As you all know, we are a company that focuses on the long term. Our strategy in business is based on long time horizons which is why we always go back to the fundamentals. At the same time, we have to address short-term challenges such as the unprecedented market conditions we face today while not losing sight of long-term value. This is exactly what we're doing. We're taking advantage of the options a deep portfolio and strong balance sheet provide reprioritizing spend to conserve cash, while progressing projects that structurally improve the company. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities investing in industry-advantaged projects that grow cash flow and support a reliable growing dividend and strong balance sheet. Obviously in this environment, it's critical to strike the right balance across these priorities and to remain flexible to market developments including an eventual recovery. And of course, we do all this while keeping our people and communities safe protecting the environment and delivering the products that society rely on. Further to that point, let me take a few minutes to discuss our response to the pandemic. Early into the pandemic, we activated our emergency response teams and implemented our business continuity plans. People who could began working from home, while additional cleaning, personal protective equipment and distancing protocols were put in place at our facilities. To-date, we've been largely successful limiting exposure and infections at our sites. To support society's broader response we increased our production of both isopropyl alcohol, a key ingredient in sanitizer and specialty polypropylene used in medical masks and hospital gowns. On top of that, our people in Baton Rouge reconfigured operations to produce, blend, package and distribute medical-grade hand sanitizer. We're donating this product to health care providers and first responders in Louisiana, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. We're also supporting efforts to design, produce and distribute new reusable medical masks and face shields to help with the shortages. And we're helping our communities around the world with donations to schools, support for food banks, and fuel, meals and masks for health care workers and first responders. I'm extremely proud of our employees. They're taking care of themselves and their families, supporting response efforts around the world, and doing their jobs, which is what I want to turn to next, starting with the pandemic's impact on the market. This chart provides a perspective of third-party supply demand projections. The dotted lines represent IEA's forecast and the blue shaded area shows the range of demand projections. As you can see, it's a pretty broad range. Our views are pretty consistent with the IEA's. April and May demand down 25% to 30%, reflecting significant reductions in the use of gasoline and jet fuel. As we reach the fourth quarter, we expect demand will be below last year due to lost economic activity. Of course, there's a lot of uncertainty on the timing of the recovery. We're planning for a slow one as it takes time to restart businesses and for consumers' confidence to grow. Hopefully, it happens faster than we think. For the full year, estimates range from a loss of 4 million to 12 million barrels per day. We expect it to be on the higher end of the range. As you can see from the red line, while significant the announced cuts of OPEC+ totaling about 13 million barrels per day are insufficient to offset the loss in demand. We're seeing this in growing global inventories, low market prices and increasing number of shut-ins. Based on the third-party demand projections and the announced OPEC+ reductions, supply and demand come into balance and then go short sometime in the second half of the year. When you factor in the growing number of industry shut-insurance, this could happen faster than projected, again depending on the recovery in demand. When it does happen we don't expect to see a market response, until the inventories are worked down. Bottom line here, it's going to be a very challenging summer with a pretty sloppy market as we move into the back half of the year. We've adjusted our plans to a low price and margin environment through year-end. Our price projections tend to be at the low end of third-party estimates. Once again, I hope we're surprised with a quick recovery, which we have not ruled out particularly given our ongoing experience in China. While it's still early days there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic as signs of demand and economic activity are beginning to pick up in China with April sales in three of our key businesses back in line with and slightly above the same period last year. It's too early to tell, if this initial rebound will be sustained, or if it reflects the broader economy, or if it is even relevant to other economies around the world given the range of government responses and policies. Nonetheless, I find it somewhat encouraging and it supports what I know will be true in the medium to long term. Economies will recover. However in the short term, we need to compensate for the significant loss in demand and revenue, which is why we announced a 15% reduction in cash OpEx and a 30% reduction in CapEx for 2020. We initiated an effort in the fourth quarter to drive efficiencies and lower cost, which has served as a springboard to this broader and much deeper effort. Spending will be maintained on activities that are critical to the integrity of our operations, the safety of our people and the protection of the environment. We're focusing on capturing additional efficiencies and lower market prices, deferring less critical spend and prioritizing quick payout items. As you can see in the chart, these efforts are already yielding results. As the year progresses, we expect to see further reductions to achieve our announced target. While doing this we remain sensitive to the unknown. In particular, we are working hard to ensure we maintain the capacity to quickly respond to market changes. We want to be well positioned to capture the eventual upswing. Turning to capital. We took a similar approach. You may recall during our Investor Day that we discussed reductions in our capital spend based on market conditions at the time. I said then that we would continue to monitor the market and make further reductions if required. Shortly thereafter, we intensified work with our venture partners, resource owners and contractors to optimize spend in light of the growing impacts of the pandemic. We set an aggressive objective, reduce spend without compromising the project advantages or returns. Any inefficiencies had to be offset with market savings or other efficiencies. I'm very pleased with the work we have done to date. Through extensive collaboration, we've identified opportunities to reduce our CapEx by 30% down to $23 billion and more than offset deferral costs, preserving the returns and project advantages. As we concluded much of this work during March, very little of it is reflected in our first quarter spend. As we progress through the year, we'll see the reductions ramp up. With a clear line of sight to the savings, I am very confident that we will meet our target. We're reducing small capital projects at most of our sites growing the pace of some downstream and chemical projects and pushing out the development of Mozambique LNG. The largest share of the reduction will be in our unconventional business, specifically the Permian Basin where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted. Let me provide a perspective on this. As we discussed in March, we have the flexibility to reduce spend in the Permian while maintaining scale, preserving capital efficiency and maximizing resource recovery through our cube developments. Neil showed these charts indicating the range of production associated with potential reductions in CapEx. Our revised plans are indicated by the red diamond at the bottom end of the range. Over the course of the year, we expect to ramp rigs down by about 75% in the Permian ending the year at approximately 15 rigs. Our remaining development activity will be focused on Poker Lake and the Delaware Basin where we are seeing high productivity wells and maintaining a scale advantage. This will include utilization of the recently completed Line one at the Cowboy Central Delivery Point. Since most of 2020's production is locked in with the work already completed, reduction in capital spend will primarily affect 2021 where we expect volumes will be down 100,000 to 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from our previous estimates. In 2020, the impact of the reduced CapEx will be much lower at about 15,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. A much larger production impact will be associated with shut-ins. With the high production rates of wells in the first two years of operation, it makes economic sense to shut these wells in during very low price environments. For this reason, we expect to shut in roughly 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. The duration of these shut-ins will obviously depend on the evolving price environment. Let me move next to an update on Guyana. Guyana remains an integral part of our long-term growth plans and as such is a high priority. Our Liza Phase 1 operations have been largely unaffected by the pandemic. Production ramp-up is progressing and should reach full capacity in the second quarter. We've also managed the impact on Liza Phase 2 keeping this project on schedule for a 2022 start-up. Unfortunately, the ongoing election process and uncertainty around the next administration has slowed government approvals of the Payara development plan. In addition, the challenge of rotating crews due to the impact of COVID-19 has temporarily slowed our drilling campaign. As a result, we expect a delay in our future developments of roughly six to 12 months pushing our production objective of more than 750,000 barrels per day into 2026. Finally, let me say a few words about our financial capacity which has been built for times like this. As you know, a strong balance sheet is a core competitive advantage and an integral part of our strategy allowing us to maintain our capital allocation priorities across the price cycles. This approach has proven itself during these trying times allowing us to selectively advance critical investments to structurally improve our business despite very low demand and margins. We issued debt of $8.5 billion in the first quarter, increasing our debt to capital to 24% and raising cash balances to more than $11 billion. We also increased our revolving credit facilities to $15 billion. With our cash, this gives us a solid backstop in these uncertain and very volatile markets. In anticipation of a slow economic recovery, we took advantage of a market window in April to issue another $9.5 billion of debt taking our estimated debt to capital to 26% and increasing cash to about $18 billion. This provides a strong foundation to manage the remaining challenges in 2020. Of course, as always we'll need to keep an eye on developments and respond accordingly. In closing, I want to reemphasize that the fundamentals that underpin our business remain unchanged. Our capital allocation priorities also remain the same, investing to create value, rewarding shareholders with a reliable growing dividend and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While we work to conserve cash in the near term, we remain focused on enhancing long-term value, leveraging our competitive advantages and the optionality provided by a deep portfolio of opportunities. We do all this, while working to ensure the safety of our people and communities and doing our part to support society response to pandemic. Our company remains strong. Our people have the skills, experience, and fortitude to not only face the challenges but to find opportunity in them emerging stronger than ever. With that, I'll turn it back to Stephen and we look forward to taking your questions.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you for your comments, Darren. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Littleton and Mr. Woods. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Hope all is well and you're safe. So, you've been steadfast on your view of secular energy demand growth with a cyclical pace and it's something you deploy a lot of human capital to. You're not just talking off agency forecasts or anything. So I wonder how that is moving around here in the early days of this crisis. For example, jet fuel, huge component of demand growth out to 2030, but maybe structurally changed. If there's anything in your forecasts on the demand side that are changing on kind of on a structural or long-term basis that might inform how you deploy capital on the other side of the crisis period of the cycle, within the prior range of your five-year plan.\nDarren Woods: Well, thanks Sam. Hope all is well with you and your family. Yes, we've looked at that. Frankly, it's real difficult to plan a longer-term horizon and factor in the impacts of what we're seeing today when what we're seeing today hasn't fully played out yet. And so I just caveat my comments with the fact that we're in the middle of this thing. And so, we'll see how it kind of plays out through the rest of the year, if it sticks with the forecasts that are out there and what I showed in my prepared comments. But if you look back in time and you can take 9/11 as an example, you have these dips and then over time you see a recovery. And while you start from a lower point, you see a continued growth and a slope that's very consistent with what the world has experienced in the past. I don't think events like this change the basic human nature or people's wants and desires. I don't think it changes people's drive to improve their living -- manage their prosperity. I don't think it changes the economic growth that's required to support growing populations, particularly in some of the developing world. So as you look further out and get past this short-term challenge, I think we're going to be back to the same fundamentals that we've always talked about, because people want a better standard of living for themselves and their family. That is a very basic human dynamic. And as I've shown before many times, as people's standards of living grows, as economies grow the demand for energy will grow with it.\nSam Margolin: Thanks. And then just as a follow-up to that theme of kind of exit rate capital spending relative to the prior five-year plan, LNG Exxon had a number of projects identified that were pre-FID. The structural challenge with that asset class always seems like there were a lot of parties that were pursuing a utility model, which sort of compressed the returns profile of it, as it just seemed like a very un-Exxon asset class in that regard. As you think about restoring capital spending to some number closer to your prior five-year range is LNG, the category that you think might have a structural slowdown in the outer years out to 2025, or are those projects still very high on your priority list?\nDarren Woods: So, I think, Sam, if you go back to the longer-term growth forecast and the demand for fuel, LNG and gas continues to be a fast-growing product and demand for LNG continues to grow. So I think that's going to continue to play a role. I think the -- if you look at the capital projects that were sanctioned and moving forward, many of those have slowed down. Some have been canceled. So I think as we go through this year, there's going to be some things changing around, which projects get sanctioned and move forward what the time frame of those projects are. And then, of course, the demand will pick back up and we'll see gas continue to grow. So my suspicion is, we'll see some shifting around in the schedules. But, again, the fundamentals are going to require additional LNG. And so I would expect to see that continue to be represented to a fairly large extent in our portfolio. What I would say on the utilities type return, it really depends on the specifics of the project. I think you can't look at those as one asset class. As you move around the world there are different dynamics and challenges and risks associated with different LNG projects. And what we look to do is to make sure that the returns of the specific projects meet our criteria. And so, that's I think how we look at it and you got to kind of separate each one individually and look at it. We've got pretty high standards to make sure that we maintain the returns that we need to as a corporation. Thank you, Sam.\nSam Margolin: Thank you so much. Be safe. Great.\nDarren Woods: You too.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jon Rigby with UBS.\nJon Rigby: Thank you. Can I -- just as a follow-on from that, just two things around that commentary about the slowdown and speed up of activity. Can you give a little bit more color on the process you go through about sort of identifying which assets you mothball or slow down how you sort of identify how you preserve value through the sort of lower spending period? And then internally give some indication of how quickly you could mobilize again in terms of people and spending to move back up to the sort of cadence that you were running at pre-COVID if that's possible. That's my first question.\nDarren Woods: Okay. Well, thanks John. Yes the process -- and if you recall when -- after our Investor Day is as Saudis and Russia made their announcements and then the impact of the COVID started picking up, we shortly after that around mid-March issued a statement that said we were going to revise our capital and OpEx targets for the year. We're going to significantly revise those and then basically announced about a month later what the reductions were. The process we went through I would characterize as a grassroots process in terms of bringing our businesses together talking about the challenges and what we needed to do as a company and then letting the businesses and our project organization step back and start engaging with the relevant stakeholders to figure out how best to make this change. And the point I made in my prepared remarks was a fundamental principle in looking at this was how do we do this recognizing that stopping some projects in progress will have some inefficiencies and costs associated with it. We need to offset those and find ways to do that and this market ought to provide that. And the fact that everybody was experiencing these challenges ought to get people similar motivations to work together and find efficiencies. And so, one key criteria was figuring out where those biggest opportunities were and therefore taking advantage of that to make sure that we did not compromise the returns of the projects. And so part of the criteria was understanding which ones had more flexibility than others. Hence the large reductions in unconventional, the short-cycle investments we had some -- a lot more opportunity in that space. So we saw a large reduction there. That was a key driver. The other then was just looking at the payout of those projects the opportunity, the rewards associated with them and thinking through from a economic profit standpoint, how we want to think about those what's the cost benefit of slowing some of those projects. And so that was another big factor. And third then was working with our partners and the resource owners to get alignment on that. So that was a -- it was a fairly robust process with a number of people involved. We were fortunate to have our projects organization in place. Last year in April, first time in the company's history we put all of our project efforts into one organization. And I would tell you that has paid huge, huge dividends during this process the ability to look across our entire portfolio leverage the relationship with our contractors has been a big, big help. With respect to your last part of your question around, how quickly can you respond I think you heard in my comments again we are anticipating a recovery. In fact, I know one will happen and that these projects remain attractive and we'll want to pursue those. And so, the big question is when and when will that recovery happen, when will we want to turn these back on. So, one of the challenges we gave the organization is while you are taking steps to make these reductions, keep an eye on the future and make sure we have a clear line of sight of how we'll restart and ramp things back up again. And so all the plans we put in place, not only have a ramp-down plan, but we're also working how we could quickly ramp that back up. And of course that will vary by project and by the circumstances within those projects. But I feel again confident that this organization is striking a really good balance between taking short-term action, but preserving long-term value.\nJon Rigby: Right. Good. And then just as a follow-up can I just get you to comment on Chem? It obviously as you referenced was still towards the bottom end of the cycle. But it seems to me the last couple of quarters, there's been some signs of improvement. Is that temporary the quarter this 1Q primarily to do with the falling liquids price, or is there some hope there that things are starting to get a little better either internally operationally or from the macro?\nDarren Woods: Well if you think -- what we've talked about in the past, what we're seeing in the chemical industry is, what I'd call is a classic commodity cycle where we had a lot of capacity brought on in the short term. While growth remains good in those products that excess capacity is overwhelm that growth in the short term and therefore driven margins down to what we're seeing at the back end of last year or really through last year. That has not changed. We continue to see basically a length in oversupply there. And the benefits we saw in the first quarter is really around feedstock and feedstock prices dropping off. To the other point within that is just, if you look at the mix of chemical products that we make, some of those in response to what we're seeing with COVID and the products required demand has grown pretty significantly. We happen to be in a position to make some specialty products that supply those markets and demand for those types of products. So we've seen a boost in that. And obviously as the COVID impacts start to wind down, we should see some of that revert back to what would be standard demand levels. I can tell you the organization remains very focused on a challenging marketplace. Steve you got anything to add to those?\nStephen Littleton: Yeah. Jon, the other thing I'd add is if you notice in the bar -- I mean the chart that we put out there, we did see really a significant improvement in our OpEx, which was the earnings benefit for us this quarter in the Chemical business.\nDarren Woods: Okay. That's a good point.\nJon Rigby: Okay. Steve, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Darren, I guess the first question is around capital allocation and dividend sustainability. We saw one of your peers reduce their dividend in light of the macro environment. Just wanted to get your views on the right level of distribution, how you think about dividend growth and how you think about that in terms of prioritization around capital allocation?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Good morning, Neil. I think as I said in my prepared remarks and I've repeated in some of our press release, the priorities in the capital allocation scheme that we've got have not changed with what we're seeing here in the short-term. And again it kind of comes back to a large business that has depleting assets. You've got to continue to invest in industry-advantaged accretive projects if you're going to sustain a strong foundation to support the business going forward, a successful business to support a growing and reliable dividend and to maintain a strong balance sheet. So the project's investments are critical foundation to the long-term health of the business. And then obviously if you look at our shareholder base about 70% of them are retail or long-term investors that look for our dividend and see that as an important source of stability in their income. And so we have a strong commitment to that. And then finally, making sure that we have a balance sheet to manage the volatility that we see in the ups and downs of the price cycles. Obviously we're in a pretty deep -- pretty big dip here, which is outside of the normal price cycle volatility. But I think we're demonstrating that the balance sheet is handling that through this time frame. So that priority remains the same. And then I think the question and I talked about this in the Investor Day is how do you balance across those priorities in the short-term. And so today as we -- to face these very short-term challenging market headwinds, we are making sure that we're maintaining that dividend and continuing to advance the projects with the expectation that we'll see a recovery. Our revenues will rise, more cash will come in, which will allow us to continue to invest in those projects. And so that we're not making a trade-off on the medium to long-term but one in the short-term based on the needs of our investment base. And I would just tell you that we'll continue to strike that balance as we go forward. If this market evolves and we see changes in a recovery that's slower than what we have even anticipated recognizing we've been pretty conservative in our outlook, we'll have to step back and look to see if we need to make any further adjustments there. But my view is, if you don't have those investments, you're not providing the foundation to support that dividend. A lot of the projects that we've been putting in place, the capital we've been spending here over the last couple of years those projects are going to come online and start contributing cash. So I think we're going to begin to see here in the next year or so, a lot of the benefits associated with the investments we have been making and that will contribute to the cash and provide the basis to support the dividend.\nNeil Mehta: And then the follow-up -- thank you, Darren. Then the follow-up is just around the capital structure and the balance sheet. As you indicated in your slides, you've got a good balance sheet and your leverage ratios are lower than your peer set. But you have been taking on debt at a quite accelerated pace here over the last couple of years. Is there a governor that you look at and say we have -- we don't want to take on any more debt? And just talk about the importance and the strength of the balance sheet to you as you think about weighing those different priorities?\nDarren Woods: Sure. I would just maybe start first with the draw that we've had on the balance sheet. And I think the context to keep in mind as we've done that is what I would call as a restructuring of the business or bringing in high-margin profitable investments into the base to strengthen the structural capacity of the company. And so that's been an important priority for us and the reason why we've increased the investment is to make sure that we're building the capital base and the assets to be successful in the markets that we expect to be in here over the next decade. And so low cost, high-margin, oil barrels, high-performance products and chemicals to meet the growing demand there and configuration of key integrated refining assets to make sure that we've got the yield profile that's consistent with demands that society have. So those investments are pretty strategic and pretty foundation. And the idea was to structurally improve the business through those investments and so that has a priority. As we did that, we wanted to make sure that we maintain the capacity to manage the swings. And as you see today, we have that capacity. So we've managed that and met that objective. And then, as we look longer-term, what's the right level, our view is it has to be sustainable something that the business continue to bear and allow us to have continued, attractive and competitive access to the debt markets. And so making sure that we keep that in a range that allows us a good access and people continue to see us as a sound investment and basis for loaning money to its going to be important. So we try to keep all that balanced, recognizing that there are going to be short-term debt dips in that process. We feel right now where we're at pretty good around, where we've leveraged up to and the resources that we have available for us. We think we've got what we need to kind of manage through this year.\nNeil Mehta: All right. Thanks, Darren.\nDarren Woods: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thank you and good morning.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I guess what I'd like to ask given the CapEx that you're doing, the ones the industry is doing the -- I guess what's called a selective shut-ins whether it's part of OPEC+ or price driven. What do you think the other side of this is, in terms of depletion rates? And the reason I asked is at the, follow-up breakfast after the investor event it was a very clear discussion from Exxon side that this 6% to 8% annual decline is out there. And the comment from those of us on the analyst investor side was we haven't seen it. So is this something that brings that more to the 4%? And how do you see that within Exxon's portfolio?\nDarren Woods: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. I think, that -- I don't think, you're going to see that change. When you say you haven't seen it our experience -- we're physically managing that every year. And so we're pretty confident in what the physics are associated with production of the oil and gas resources that we've got. What often maybe obscures the view is a lot of work programs that companies are doing to maintain and offset that decline which doesn't often -- they're not discrete projects so to speak so it's often hard to model those. But there is a lot of activity. In fact we do that, ourselves to offset that natural decline work. And that takes resources that takes capital and investment spend. So I think, what you're going to find, which I'm not sure if this is where your question was heading. But as you strip out some of that work and those programs to reduce activity to mitigate that decline, because the revenues aren't there to support it. I think you'll see that decline rate manifest itself more explicitly across the industry.  So my view would be you'll probably get a better visibility into that. It won't be a change per se around what naturally happens through production. It'll just be that the offsets aren't necessarily masking that underlying decline rate and then, just stepping back maybe more broadly to your question. I was at the Investor Day and I think as a company we continue to believe that the industry as a whole has been under investing for the demand that's going to be needed in the future. Obviously, what's happened here with the coronavirus and the drop in prices is going to pull a lot more capital out of the industry as you've seen -- as you've already seen which is going to exaggerate that issue. So I think on the back end of this thing we're going to find a market that eventually gets a lot shorter than we were already anticipating.\nRoger Read: Yeah. That's -- I think, that's the right direction. It's just been close to that. Thanks for that.\nDarren Woods: Welcome Roger.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Roger.\nRoger Read: I guess the next question, I'd like to go to on the Downstream obviously you've mentioned that things had improved or were improving in China. We'll see if that sustains. Within the U.S. and Europe, we've seen the first signs of some of the lockdowns come off. And I was just curious, if you had any kind of more immediate responses in terms of North American or European demand trends.\nDarren Woods: Yeah. No that's something we're keeping a really close eye on is, what are the tell signs in terms of what we see. And April was significantly lower demand month than what we saw in March. And so I kind of saw that, as the depth of the coronavirus impact. If you look at kind of going forward into May -- and what we're using in terms of looking -- trying to get a view of that looking forward is sales out of our retail assets around the world and using that to see how -- what kind of demand response for people primarily around road transportation. And we are seeing improvements really across all three markets. We've seen in May volumes trending up in Europe. We see that happening in the U.S. and we see that also in Asia, although, Asia didn't drop nearly as far as Europe or the U.S. And so there are some. I'd say encouraging early signs in the transportation sector particularly road transportation. I think on aviation that's probably going to take a little bit longer. We haven't seen any uptick in that space yet.\nRoger Read: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You're welcome. Take care.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Darren. I hope everybody is doing well over there. And obviously, we appreciate all the comments you guys have been making about how you've adjusted your business to adapt to this situation we're in right now. I have two questions. They're really follow-ups I guess to what Neil, asked but I want to be a little bit more direct if I may. What are the circumstances, Darren, I think you've been pretty clear. You've obviously underlined the issue of the dividend. But what are the circumstances where you would ever envisage that Exxon Mobil would cut its dividend?\nDarren Woods: Well, good morning, Doug and everyone's fine here so thank you for asking. I hope the same is true with you. Look, you know -- I know you're looking for a very explicit answer. And all I would tell you is we think it's -- the dividend is an important part of the value proposition that we provide to our shareholders particularly given the base of our shareholders. It would depend on the circumstances that we see in the market and how prolonged we think those circumstances are going to exist. So, I mean, I would just tell you we're going to have to wait and see how the market plays itself out. If we find ourselves with some sustained structural deficit that says the business is going to have trouble over a much longer time period, we'd have to step back and rethink that. But frankly, we're not seeing that today. If you look at some of the early signs, I think, we see some encouragement in -- going into May. And so I think we're going to have to kind of play that by ear. The beauty of the dividend is it's flexible. We -- the Board considers that every quarter and we're obviously, looking at the macro environment looking at some of the -- kind of telltales that are out there. We've got our organization working very hard around what are some leading metrics that we can keep an eye on to see which direction things are going. And so we're going to continue to look at that and make decisions as we go forward to ensure that for the long-term, this business is strong and has a good foundation to provide continuing dividends out into the future and products that the world are going to need.\nDoug Leggate: I understand, it's a tough one to answer explicitly. I guess the perception out there is - rather Shell has given you cover -- given the industry cover for a wholesale reset. I just wanted to see if you could offer some perspective. But I appreciate you answering to the extent you have. Well my follow-up is just kind of -- go on sure.\nDarren Woods: Doug, let me just say, on that. Well, we're not -- I don't really look to what Shell is doing to decide our dividend policy frankly. It's a function of our investment base and the commitment that we've made to them.\nDoug Leggate: And the opportunity set for sure. My follow-up is kind of related. The credit agencies took, obviously, took you down a notch. You've obviously added that and presumably you shared with them what you were doing. Where -- is there a limit that you would be comfortable allowing the balance sheet to go? And again it's tender dividend related as well I guess. Your capital is flexible if the dividend is sacrosanct. Where does the balance sheet get to a level where you're not comfortable? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Well, again I know you like real specific numbers. But I would just tell you one of the principles that we had in managing the balance sheet is to make sure that we maintain capacity because as we've just seen here this quarter the market's got a lot of volatility in it. And therefore, we need to have a foundation or a base that allows us to accommodate that volatility. And we need to have access -- competitive access to the market. So we're going to make sure that we stay in a range that allows us to competitively continue -- to competitively access the debt markets when we need them and make sure that we've got a buffer that allows us to run and continue to manage the ups and downs that are not going to away in this commodity-based business. So again it's an ongoing conversation something that the Board and I spent time talking about and looking at. And we're going to kind of continue to adjust it as we go forward. I mean, the priorities that I've laid out around the investment the dividends and the balance sheet -- and I used the term earlier this morning, I used it in our Investor Day balance. We got to kind of balance it based on what we see happening in the marketplace. We -- today we've taken a position that we believe balance in what we're seeing. As the quarter moves on if things don't play out the way we think or we see something that's structurally very different than what we anticipate, we'll look at rebalancing that. It's just difficult to tell right now frankly.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, Darren. Good luck.\nDarren Woods: Good. Thank you, Doug. Take care.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI.\nDoug Terreson: Good morning, everybody. \nDarren Woods: Good morning, Doug.\nStephen Littleton: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: So Darren, you reiterated your business plan which you guys have had for a while that global prosperity would drive investment and that you guys would end up excelling versus your peers through advantaged investments. And on this point you kind of also indicated that your priorities for capital management aren't going to change, but the pace probably would. So my question is that do you think that we'd know already that there are going to be broad changes to Exxon Mobil and the industry's capital management program over the medium-term? And so what might be different -- meaning you just use the word balance to describe the approach. Do you think we need better balance or maybe more balance? And also how does consolidation play into all of this that is if you think it does given the distress that we're seeing in the energy markets today?\nDarren Woods : Yes. Thanks Doug. Hope all is well with you. On the balancing, I think that balance is going to be a very I'll call it sector maybe company-specific point in terms of where everyone stands with respect to their balance sheet, with their capacity, their scale, their integration. So I think the balance will be different. And in my view some segments of our industry today needed better balance and I think that will manifest itself. I think there -- you got to be able to survive through these downturns and position your company to do that. So I do think there's a balance that's needed there. I also think that the demand will be there, because of the fundamental role it plays in economic growth in people's lives. And so as much as the short-term kind of swings the industry around, ultimately the demand for the products will come back and the industry is going to have to respond to that demand. And if in the short-term a lot more conservatism comes in, a lot less capital flows into the marketplace, we'll open up that supply/demand balance going forward and that will then incentivize things coming back in, and frankly, may lead to less balance in terms of what you're talking about. So I think it's really a function of the capacity and capability of companies to kind of weather through this short-term period. And I think some companies are better positioned to do that than others, which is -- probably leads you to your second point about consolidation. And I think again that opportunity exists particularly in periods like that. If you look back in time when prices get low and companies get stressed you see that tend to happen not only in our industry, but in other industries. So that's certainly a theme, which I think will resonate within the industry. Exactly how that plays itself out though I think we'll just have to wait and see.\nDoug Terreson: Yes. Let me ask you something else about that. I mean, it always -- there always seems to be the ability to have financial transactions work, but when you guys bought Mobil there was obviously lots of strategic merit to that combination and other combinations during that period as well. So do you think that we're in an environment where there is enough strategic merits, especially -- in combinations, especially for a company your size, or do you think it's different this time around?\nDarren Woods: I come back to a lot of the value levers that we saw with the Exxon Mobil merger. I mean, those value levers I don't think have really changed over time. And so it's really a question of what opportunities are out there where you can see some of those probably a subset of the value levers that we saw with that. And of course, as we look at opportunities -- I've been asked this a lot of times in these calls about acquisitions. And what I've always said is we have to look and find some unique value levers to justify the deal. And if you can't do that then there's no space for the deal. And that has really been I think the underlying criteria that we've had as we've looked at acquisitions as we continue to look at acquisitions and opportunities is can we find a way of creating and extracting unique value out of some acquisition or opportunity. And that's not going to change. We continue to look for those things. And if we find them\u2026\nDoug Terreson: Thank you. Yes.\nDarren Woods: Hey, you bet. Thank you, Doug.\nStephen Littleton: Thanks, Doug.\nDoug Terreson: Yeah. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning everyone. My first question\u2026\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first question maybe skipping gears real quick here is on the Permian. And you've invested meaningful capital in the Permian including on infrastructure spending. And your partners have indicated that the Wink-Webster pipeline has not been delayed. So is it fair to think that when Exxon eventually does resume some kind of higher level of overall corporate CapEx that the Permian would be the first call on growth capital from a returns perspective? And given the reduced CapEx in the Permian this year is there any infrastructure build-out that you need to address before you get back to your prior growth trajectory? I know you mentioned that the Line 1 of the Cowboy facility was complete.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Thanks Jeanine. So and Neil talked about this in our Investor Day as we looked at the range of flexibility that we had. And that was one of the points I think Neil tried to make was we -- even within in early March as we looked at our investments in the unconventional space that we did have opportunities to ramp down spend and investment there and still fully utilize the infrastructure that we are putting in place and making sure that we got a return on those investments. And frankly, it was pretty critical to do that and maintain scale and scale advantage in the cost. If you think more broadly about what we're trying to do in the Permian, it's really with this long supply market in mind that we've got to find a way to get the cost -- the unit cost of production in the Permian down. And the way we're approaching that is through scale and technology. We think that's absolutely critical. And so, our view is to make that investment in the Permian very competitive in an oversupplied market which I would tell you we're well on the way towards. And so, the cuts we've seen to date allow us to continue to preserve that capital efficiency. It allows us to do -- continue with the development, the cube developments to make sure we're maximizing the recovery, and it utilizes our above-surface facility. So I think that's where we're at today. And we're looking now -- and you saw in the presentation that Stephen gave with the second quarter outlook we are taking economic shut-ins in the Permian. And that's not a -- that's really a function of -- if you think about a lot of these wells that are early in their lives which just started up you get very high production rates. And from an economic -- maximizing the NPV of those wells, you're better off deferring that high production rate into a period with better pricing. And so a lot of the shut-ins that we're doing in the upstream are associated with kind of a value play around making sure that we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive to high production rates. And of course, looking forward, depending on how the market evolves, we've got the flexibility to bring a lot of those wells back on quickly and ramp up what we're doing in the unconventional space. So it is -- you all have talked about that. We've talked about it. That short-cycle investment gives us a lot of flexibility and we're certainly leveraging it. There's a lot of value there too. I would tell you, we continue to feel very good about the ability for that resource when we get it online to compete in a low-price environment. The challenge we've got today is the investment we're making to get in that position and that's kind of what's inhibiting us, but once we get into it we feel really good about operating competitively in an oversupplied market.\nJeanine Wai: Thank you for the very comprehensive answer. My follow-up question is maybe following up on some of the other questions, but in a different way. Darren, you already have some pre-FID capital invested in attractive projects. And if we end up being in a prolonged oil price environment, at what point is it too detrimental to the long-term business to stay at the current CapEx level, since at some point you need to continue to invest in the business to grow the cash flow to sustain the dividend? And you mentioned earlier on the call, that there is an economic cost for slowing down some of these projects, but you still think that there's long-term fundamentals that are intact.\nDarren Woods: Yeah. I think Jeanine, we'll have to watch and see how the world evolves. I mean I keep coming back to -- and I know you guys probably feel like it's a repetitive statement, but the basic drivers of energy demand have not changed with what we're seeing today. The demand drivers the fact that energy plays such a critical role in people's everyday lives and the growth of economies mean that that energy will be needed. So it's really a question of timing and the recovery. And again, I think, we're -- April is probably the depth of the impact in our industry. I hope that's true. Certainly, it's looking that way from the early signs. But we're going to have to let this kind of quarter play out. I think the second quarter will be a challenging quarter, but we'll have a better view around how the rest of the year is shaping up and we'll continue to adjust it. We've got additional flexibility to use if we want to. And if we start to conclude that based on some structural change, which frankly it's hard to see right now, but if we see that we'll adjust the plans again.\nJeanine Wai: Great. Thank you for the answer.\nDarren Woods: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.\nJason Gammel: Thanks very much, gentlemen. I just wanted to see, if I could get you to elaborate a little bit further on the sources of the production curtailments that you're going to be undertaking over the course of the quarter. And are they primarily based upon the economics of the individual plays, or is some of this at the direction of host governments?\nDarren Woods: Yeah. No. I would say, the 400 koebd that we put in Stephen's second quarter look ahead. And I would tell you the way to think about that is about two-thirds of that roughly would be in the economic category and about half of that in Kearl, and then the other half in this economic steps that we're taking in the Permian, which is really around preserving value. Kearl with a low price environment I think it's more challenged from a competitive or cost of supply basis. Permian we get higher value by deferring some of those. And so, about a third -- out of Kearl, about a third in the unconventional space and then about a third associated with restrictions put on us by the governments around the world.\nJason Gammel: Yeah. That's very useful. You actually somewhat pre-empted my follow-up question, which was going to note that the operational performance at Kearl has actually been quite strong. So, you're talking about the potential economic shut-ins that -- could you maybe elaborate a little bit more about any logistical issues that could constrain Kearl to coming back in the near term?\nDarren Woods: Sure. I know there's been a lot written about that. I would have to tell you, this has been again another really great benefit of the reorganizations that we've done along the value chain with our Upstream. We made the change in our Downstream, beginning of 2018. We made the change in the Upstream in April 2019. And so if you look today, as we headed into this, our ability to see end to end from the wellhead all the way down to the customers, I think was the best in industry frankly. Certainly, nobody had anything better in terms of that ability to see along. And so we were very early into that process making sure that we had a clear line of sight of how we would move the physicals and that we do not find logistics constraints. Of course, you know we've been investing in logistics both out of Canada and Kearl with takeaway capacity there on the rail and in type. And we've invested in the Permian and takeaway capacity there. And so we've got I think a good line of sight of where the bottlenecks are going to happen and really secure position with respect to the logistics to move the barrels. And we've applied -- our team has basically been keeping an eye on that around the world, not just out of those two resource plays, but everywhere that we lift barrel is making sure that we've got a clear line of sight of how we keep them flowing to the extent that the economics warrant that. So we have not seen the logistics constraints that others have talked about, just because of the fact that the organization was able to kind of see some of those coming and take the appropriate steps to make sure we didn't get caught with any of them.\nJason Gammel: Very appreciate dealing with Upstream.\nDarren Woods: Operator, we probably have time for one more call.\nOperator: Okay. We'll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning, Darren. Thanks for taking the question.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: So one of the, I guess bridges of the multiyear guidance was your asset sale plan. And I'm just wondering -- obviously this is a tougher environment for asset sales. So I guess, is it fair to assume that that lever -- the next one to two years might get pushed back a bit? And then in terms of the impact kind of shorter term on the balance sheet from that is that you need to -- with the lower prices you need to lean more in the balance sheet in the interim. So just curious how you think about toggling between those two items. And I guess, it does all kind of come back to the dividend question being asked. Is it -- if the asset sale bridge isn't there, do you look to the flexibility that dividend is something that can help? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure Phil. Good morning to you. I would say, you're absolutely -- the activity that we have, the focus that we have around restructuring the portfolio and high-grading that portfolio hasn't really changed, so the drivers and the motivation remain there. The work list that we have with respect to getting assets in the marketplace and the divestments are still in place. It's really a question of what we said all along is our ability to execute that divestment program will be a function of finding buyers who put a value on those assets, a value that's higher than what we see with them and so that we find a deal space and transact. And I think your point, which is a valid one and absolutely correct I think is going to be harder to do that in an environment like this where people are strapped of cash. So I would expect to see that divestment program slowed just because of the market dynamics and the buyer, seller -- the availability of buyers. And we're not counting on that with respect to how we think about the business and how we're going to fund the ongoing business. We have not assumed that we're going to benefit from asset sales. All of our plans are based on essentially managing with the portfolio that we have.\nPhil Gresh: Okay great. The second one I guess, this one is just around the quarter for Steve. In your 8-K, you gave obviously the guidance items around these inventory impacts and you also gave guidance around the derivative impacts on the Downstream side of the business. I think there's a little confusion on Downstream specifically with those derivative impacts. But could you just clarify the magnitude of that benefit that was baked into I think the margin bar in the bridge?\nStephen Littleton: Yes. Phil, if you look at the margin factor included in that was the benefit of financial derivatives of about $1.3 billion or so plus or minus. And then obviously, that was offset by weaker refining margins. They brought it back down to about a $900-plus million benefit to the Downstream business.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Phil. Operator?\nOperator: At this time, I'll turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks.\nStephen Littleton: Okay. Thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight first quarter results and the steps we're taking to not only manage through these challenging times, but to position ourselves for long-term growth in the eventual recovery. We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you and please be safe.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephen and good morning, everybody. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. We certainly appreciate you taking time to join us today. I think we can all agree that these are very challenging times. And I know, I speak for many when I say that our thoughts are with those who have been personally affected by this pandemic with the health care workers and first responders who are on the front lines. This morning, I will discuss how we are approaching the current circumstances and how we are working to keep our people and communities safe managing through the near-term market downturn and preserving long-term shareholder value. As you well know, today we face two acute challenges: a global threat to public health and a significant global economic downturn resulting in a commodity price collapse. What started with an oversupply situation was made more extreme by a sudden and unprecedented drop in energy demand as the economy shut down to stop the spread of the virus. As a capital-intensive commodity business, we certainly weathered the ups and downs of many price cycles. However, I have to say we've never seen anything like what the world is experiencing today. Our response is primarily focused on three areas: protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to provide the critical energy and products that support modern life and the COVID response efforts and aggressively reducing spend in today's depressed markets, while preserving value to ensure we are in the best position for the eventual recovery. I know that there are a lot of different views on what the future holds, but I want to be clear on how we see it. The long-term fundamentals that drive our business have not changed. Despite the current uncertainty and volatility, the fundamentals that underpin our business remains strong. Why do I say that? We know that in the coming decades populations will grow to more than 9 billion people by 2040 up from just over 7 billion today. Billions of people will enter the middle class and seek lifestyles and products that require energy. Economies will expand once again. Of course, there are likely to be some bumps in the road over the short-term, but historically periods of economic contraction are followed by periods of significant growth. Finally as a result of growing populations increased prosperity and economic expansion, energy consumption will increase. Even with the current downturn projections show energy consumption growing by 20% through 2040. Most of the growth will be in developing nations and more than half of that energy demand will be met by oil and natural gas. As you all know, we are a company that focuses on the long term. Our strategy in business is based on long time horizons which is why we always go back to the fundamentals. At the same time, we have to address short-term challenges such as the unprecedented market conditions we face today while not losing sight of long-term value. This is exactly what we're doing. We're taking advantage of the options a deep portfolio and strong balance sheet provide reprioritizing spend to conserve cash, while progressing projects that structurally improve the company. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities investing in industry-advantaged projects that grow cash flow and support a reliable growing dividend and strong balance sheet. Obviously in this environment, it's critical to strike the right balance across these priorities and to remain flexible to market developments including an eventual recovery. And of course, we do all this while keeping our people and communities safe protecting the environment and delivering the products that society rely on. Further to that point, let me take a few minutes to discuss our response to the pandemic. Early into the pandemic, we activated our emergency response teams and implemented our business continuity plans. People who could began working from home, while additional cleaning, personal protective equipment and distancing protocols were put in place at our facilities. To-date, we've been largely successful limiting exposure and infections at our sites. To support society's broader response we increased our production of both isopropyl alcohol, a key ingredient in sanitizer and specialty polypropylene used in medical masks and hospital gowns. On top of that, our people in Baton Rouge reconfigured operations to produce, blend, package and distribute medical-grade hand sanitizer. We're donating this product to health care providers and first responders in Louisiana, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. We're also supporting efforts to design, produce and distribute new reusable medical masks and face shields to help with the shortages. And we're helping our communities around the world with donations to schools, support for food banks, and fuel, meals and masks for health care workers and first responders. I'm extremely proud of our employees. They're taking care of themselves and their families, supporting response efforts around the world, and doing their jobs, which is what I want to turn to next, starting with the pandemic's impact on the market. This chart provides a perspective of third-party supply demand projections. The dotted lines represent IEA's forecast and the blue shaded area shows the range of demand projections. As you can see, it's a pretty broad range. Our views are pretty consistent with the IEA's. April and May demand down 25% to 30%, reflecting significant reductions in the use of gasoline and jet fuel. As we reach the fourth quarter, we expect demand will be below last year due to lost economic activity. Of course, there's a lot of uncertainty on the timing of the recovery. We're planning for a slow one as it takes time to restart businesses and for consumers' confidence to grow. Hopefully, it happens faster than we think. For the full year, estimates range from a loss of 4 million to 12 million barrels per day. We expect it to be on the higher end of the range. As you can see from the red line, while significant the announced cuts of OPEC+ totaling about 13 million barrels per day are insufficient to offset the loss in demand. We're seeing this in growing global inventories, low market prices and increasing number of shut-ins. Based on the third-party demand projections and the announced OPEC+ reductions, supply and demand come into balance and then go short sometime in the second half of the year. When you factor in the growing number of industry shut-insurance, this could happen faster than projected, again depending on the recovery in demand. When it does happen we don't expect to see a market response, until the inventories are worked down. Bottom line here, it's going to be a very challenging summer with a pretty sloppy market as we move into the back half of the year. We've adjusted our plans to a low price and margin environment through year-end. Our price projections tend to be at the low end of third-party estimates. Once again, I hope we're surprised with a quick recovery, which we have not ruled out particularly given our ongoing experience in China. While it's still early days there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic as signs of demand and economic activity are beginning to pick up in China with April sales in three of our key businesses back in line with and slightly above the same period last year. It's too early to tell, if this initial rebound will be sustained, or if it reflects the broader economy, or if it is even relevant to other economies around the world given the range of government responses and policies. Nonetheless, I find it somewhat encouraging and it supports what I know will be true in the medium to long term. Economies will recover. However in the short term, we need to compensate for the significant loss in demand and revenue, which is why we announced a 15% reduction in cash OpEx and a 30% reduction in CapEx for 2020. We initiated an effort in the fourth quarter to drive efficiencies and lower cost, which has served as a springboard to this broader and much deeper effort. Spending will be maintained on activities that are critical to the integrity of our operations, the safety of our people and the protection of the environment. We're focusing on capturing additional efficiencies and lower market prices, deferring less critical spend and prioritizing quick payout items. As you can see in the chart, these efforts are already yielding results. As the year progresses, we expect to see further reductions to achieve our announced target. While doing this we remain sensitive to the unknown. In particular, we are working hard to ensure we maintain the capacity to quickly respond to market changes. We want to be well positioned to capture the eventual upswing. Turning to capital. We took a similar approach. You may recall during our Investor Day that we discussed reductions in our capital spend based on market conditions at the time. I said then that we would continue to monitor the market and make further reductions if required. Shortly thereafter, we intensified work with our venture partners, resource owners and contractors to optimize spend in light of the growing impacts of the pandemic. We set an aggressive objective, reduce spend without compromising the project advantages or returns. Any inefficiencies had to be offset with market savings or other efficiencies. I'm very pleased with the work we have done to date. Through extensive collaboration, we've identified opportunities to reduce our CapEx by 30% down to $23 billion and more than offset deferral costs, preserving the returns and project advantages. As we concluded much of this work during March, very little of it is reflected in our first quarter spend. As we progress through the year, we'll see the reductions ramp up. With a clear line of sight to the savings, I am very confident that we will meet our target. We're reducing small capital projects at most of our sites growing the pace of some downstream and chemical projects and pushing out the development of Mozambique LNG. The largest share of the reduction will be in our unconventional business, specifically the Permian Basin where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted. Let me provide a perspective on this. As we discussed in March, we have the flexibility to reduce spend in the Permian while maintaining scale, preserving capital efficiency and maximizing resource recovery through our cube developments. Neil showed these charts indicating the range of production associated with potential reductions in CapEx. Our revised plans are indicated by the red diamond at the bottom end of the range. Over the course of the year, we expect to ramp rigs down by about 75% in the Permian ending the year at approximately 15 rigs. Our remaining development activity will be focused on Poker Lake and the Delaware Basin where we are seeing high productivity wells and maintaining a scale advantage. This will include utilization of the recently completed Line one at the Cowboy Central Delivery Point. Since most of 2020's production is locked in with the work already completed, reduction in capital spend will primarily affect 2021 where we expect volumes will be down 100,000 to 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from our previous estimates. In 2020, the impact of the reduced CapEx will be much lower at about 15,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. A much larger production impact will be associated with shut-ins. With the high production rates of wells in the first two years of operation, it makes economic sense to shut these wells in during very low price environments. For this reason, we expect to shut in roughly 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. The duration of these shut-ins will obviously depend on the evolving price environment. Let me move next to an update on Guyana. Guyana remains an integral part of our long-term growth plans and as such is a high priority. Our Liza Phase 1 operations have been largely unaffected by the pandemic. Production ramp-up is progressing and should reach full capacity in the second quarter. We've also managed the impact on Liza Phase 2 keeping this project on schedule for a 2022 start-up. Unfortunately, the ongoing election process and uncertainty around the next administration has slowed government approvals of the Payara development plan. In addition, the challenge of rotating crews due to the impact of COVID-19 has temporarily slowed our drilling campaign. As a result, we expect a delay in our future developments of roughly six to 12 months pushing our production objective of more than 750,000 barrels per day into 2026. Finally, let me say a few words about our financial capacity which has been built for times like this. As you know, a strong balance sheet is a core competitive advantage and an integral part of our strategy allowing us to maintain our capital allocation priorities across the price cycles. This approach has proven itself during these trying times allowing us to selectively advance critical investments to structurally improve our business despite very low demand and margins. We issued debt of $8.5 billion in the first quarter, increasing our debt to capital to 24% and raising cash balances to more than $11 billion. We also increased our revolving credit facilities to $15 billion. With our cash, this gives us a solid backstop in these uncertain and very volatile markets. In anticipation of a slow economic recovery, we took advantage of a market window in April to issue another $9.5 billion of debt taking our estimated debt to capital to 26% and increasing cash to about $18 billion. This provides a strong foundation to manage the remaining challenges in 2020. Of course, as always we'll need to keep an eye on developments and respond accordingly. In closing, I want to reemphasize that the fundamentals that underpin our business remain unchanged. Our capital allocation priorities also remain the same, investing to create value, rewarding shareholders with a reliable growing dividend and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While we work to conserve cash in the near term, we remain focused on enhancing long-term value, leveraging our competitive advantages and the optionality provided by a deep portfolio of opportunities. We do all this, while working to ensure the safety of our people and communities and doing our part to support society response to pandemic. Our company remains strong. Our people have the skills, experience, and fortitude to not only face the challenges but to find opportunity in them emerging stronger than ever. With that, I'll turn it back to Stephen and we look forward to taking your questions. Well, thanks Sam. Hope all is well with you and your family. Yes, we've looked at that. Frankly, it's real difficult to plan a longer-term horizon and factor in the impacts of what we're seeing today when what we're seeing today hasn't fully played out yet. And so I just caveat my comments with the fact that we're in the middle of this thing. And so, we'll see how it kind of plays out through the rest of the year, if it sticks with the forecasts that are out there and what I showed in my prepared comments. But if you look back in time and you can take 9/11 as an example, you have these dips and then over time you see a recovery. And while you start from a lower point, you see a continued growth and a slope that's very consistent with what the world has experienced in the past. I don't think events like this change the basic human nature or people's wants and desires. I don't think it changes people's drive to improve their living -- manage their prosperity. I don't think it changes the economic growth that's required to support growing populations, particularly in some of the developing world. So as you look further out and get past this short-term challenge, I think we're going to be back to the same fundamentals that we've always talked about, because people want a better standard of living for themselves and their family. That is a very basic human dynamic. And as I've shown before many times, as people's standards of living grows, as economies grow the demand for energy will grow with it. So, I think, Sam, if you go back to the longer-term growth forecast and the demand for fuel, LNG and gas continues to be a fast-growing product and demand for LNG continues to grow. So I think that's going to continue to play a role. I think the -- if you look at the capital projects that were sanctioned and moving forward, many of those have slowed down. Some have been canceled. So I think as we go through this year, there's going to be some things changing around, which projects get sanctioned and move forward what the time frame of those projects are. And then, of course, the demand will pick back up and we'll see gas continue to grow. So my suspicion is, we'll see some shifting around in the schedules. But, again, the fundamentals are going to require additional LNG. And so I would expect to see that continue to be represented to a fairly large extent in our portfolio. What I would say on the utilities type return, it really depends on the specifics of the project. I think you can't look at those as one asset class. As you move around the world there are different dynamics and challenges and risks associated with different LNG projects. And what we look to do is to make sure that the returns of the specific projects meet our criteria. And so, that's I think how we look at it and you got to kind of separate each one individually and look at it. We've got pretty high standards to make sure that we maintain the returns that we need to as a corporation. Thank you, Sam. You too. Okay. Well, thanks John. Yes the process -- and if you recall when -- after our Investor Day is as Saudis and Russia made their announcements and then the impact of the COVID started picking up, we shortly after that around mid-March issued a statement that said we were going to revise our capital and OpEx targets for the year. We're going to significantly revise those and then basically announced about a month later what the reductions were. The process we went through I would characterize as a grassroots process in terms of bringing our businesses together talking about the challenges and what we needed to do as a company and then letting the businesses and our project organization step back and start engaging with the relevant stakeholders to figure out how best to make this change. And the point I made in my prepared remarks was a fundamental principle in looking at this was how do we do this recognizing that stopping some projects in progress will have some inefficiencies and costs associated with it. We need to offset those and find ways to do that and this market ought to provide that. And the fact that everybody was experiencing these challenges ought to get people similar motivations to work together and find efficiencies. And so, one key criteria was figuring out where those biggest opportunities were and therefore taking advantage of that to make sure that we did not compromise the returns of the projects. And so part of the criteria was understanding which ones had more flexibility than others. Hence the large reductions in unconventional, the short-cycle investments we had some -- a lot more opportunity in that space. So we saw a large reduction there. That was a key driver. The other then was just looking at the payout of those projects the opportunity, the rewards associated with them and thinking through from a economic profit standpoint, how we want to think about those what's the cost benefit of slowing some of those projects. And so that was another big factor. And third then was working with our partners and the resource owners to get alignment on that. So that was a -- it was a fairly robust process with a number of people involved. We were fortunate to have our projects organization in place. Last year in April, first time in the company's history we put all of our project efforts into one organization. And I would tell you that has paid huge, huge dividends during this process the ability to look across our entire portfolio leverage the relationship with our contractors has been a big, big help. With respect to your last part of your question around, how quickly can you respond I think you heard in my comments again we are anticipating a recovery. In fact, I know one will happen and that these projects remain attractive and we'll want to pursue those. And so, the big question is when and when will that recovery happen, when will we want to turn these back on. So, one of the challenges we gave the organization is while you are taking steps to make these reductions, keep an eye on the future and make sure we have a clear line of sight of how we'll restart and ramp things back up again. And so all the plans we put in place, not only have a ramp-down plan, but we're also working how we could quickly ramp that back up. And of course that will vary by project and by the circumstances within those projects. But I feel again confident that this organization is striking a really good balance between taking short-term action, but preserving long-term value. Well if you think -- what we've talked about in the past, what we're seeing in the chemical industry is, what I'd call is a classic commodity cycle where we had a lot of capacity brought on in the short term. While growth remains good in those products that excess capacity is overwhelm that growth in the short term and therefore driven margins down to what we're seeing at the back end of last year or really through last year. That has not changed. We continue to see basically a length in oversupply there. And the benefits we saw in the first quarter is really around feedstock and feedstock prices dropping off. To the other point within that is just, if you look at the mix of chemical products that we make, some of those in response to what we're seeing with COVID and the products required demand has grown pretty significantly. We happen to be in a position to make some specialty products that supply those markets and demand for those types of products. So we've seen a boost in that. And obviously as the COVID impacts start to wind down, we should see some of that revert back to what would be standard demand levels. I can tell you the organization remains very focused on a challenging marketplace. Steve you got anything to add to those? Okay. That's a good point. Sure. Good morning, Neil. I think as I said in my prepared remarks and I've repeated in some of our press release, the priorities in the capital allocation scheme that we've got have not changed with what we're seeing here in the short-term. And again it kind of comes back to a large business that has depleting assets. You've got to continue to invest in industry-advantaged accretive projects if you're going to sustain a strong foundation to support the business going forward, a successful business to support a growing and reliable dividend and to maintain a strong balance sheet. So the project's investments are critical foundation to the long-term health of the business. And then obviously if you look at our shareholder base about 70% of them are retail or long-term investors that look for our dividend and see that as an important source of stability in their income. And so we have a strong commitment to that. And then finally, making sure that we have a balance sheet to manage the volatility that we see in the ups and downs of the price cycles. Obviously we're in a pretty deep -- pretty big dip here, which is outside of the normal price cycle volatility. But I think we're demonstrating that the balance sheet is handling that through this time frame. So that priority remains the same. And then I think the question and I talked about this in the Investor Day is how do you balance across those priorities in the short-term. And so today as we -- to face these very short-term challenging market headwinds, we are making sure that we're maintaining that dividend and continuing to advance the projects with the expectation that we'll see a recovery. Our revenues will rise, more cash will come in, which will allow us to continue to invest in those projects. And so that we're not making a trade-off on the medium to long-term but one in the short-term based on the needs of our investment base. And I would just tell you that we'll continue to strike that balance as we go forward. If this market evolves and we see changes in a recovery that's slower than what we have even anticipated recognizing we've been pretty conservative in our outlook, we'll have to step back and look to see if we need to make any further adjustments there. But my view is, if you don't have those investments, you're not providing the foundation to support that dividend. A lot of the projects that we've been putting in place, the capital we've been spending here over the last couple of years those projects are going to come online and start contributing cash. So I think we're going to begin to see here in the next year or so, a lot of the benefits associated with the investments we have been making and that will contribute to the cash and provide the basis to support the dividend. Sure. I would just maybe start first with the draw that we've had on the balance sheet. And I think the context to keep in mind as we've done that is what I would call as a restructuring of the business or bringing in high-margin profitable investments into the base to strengthen the structural capacity of the company. And so that's been an important priority for us and the reason why we've increased the investment is to make sure that we're building the capital base and the assets to be successful in the markets that we expect to be in here over the next decade. And so low cost, high-margin, oil barrels, high-performance products and chemicals to meet the growing demand there and configuration of key integrated refining assets to make sure that we've got the yield profile that's consistent with demands that society have. So those investments are pretty strategic and pretty foundation. And the idea was to structurally improve the business through those investments and so that has a priority. As we did that, we wanted to make sure that we maintain the capacity to manage the swings. And as you see today, we have that capacity. So we've managed that and met that objective. And then, as we look longer-term, what's the right level, our view is it has to be sustainable something that the business continue to bear and allow us to have continued, attractive and competitive access to the debt markets. And so making sure that we keep that in a range that allows us a good access and people continue to see us as a sound investment and basis for loaning money to its going to be important. So we try to keep all that balanced, recognizing that there are going to be short-term debt dips in that process. We feel right now where we're at pretty good around, where we've leveraged up to and the resources that we have available for us. We think we've got what we need to kind of manage through this year. Sure. Good morning, Roger. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. I think, that -- I don't think, you're going to see that change. When you say you haven't seen it our experience -- we're physically managing that every year. And so we're pretty confident in what the physics are associated with production of the oil and gas resources that we've got. What often maybe obscures the view is a lot of work programs that companies are doing to maintain and offset that decline which doesn't often -- they're not discrete projects so to speak so it's often hard to model those. But there is a lot of activity. In fact we do that, ourselves to offset that natural decline work. And that takes resources that takes capital and investment spend. So I think, what you're going to find, which I'm not sure if this is where your question was heading. But as you strip out some of that work and those programs to reduce activity to mitigate that decline, because the revenues aren't there to support it. I think you'll see that decline rate manifest itself more explicitly across the industry.  So my view would be you'll probably get a better visibility into that. It won't be a change per se around what naturally happens through production. It'll just be that the offsets aren't necessarily masking that underlying decline rate and then, just stepping back maybe more broadly to your question. I was at the Investor Day and I think as a company we continue to believe that the industry as a whole has been under investing for the demand that's going to be needed in the future. Obviously, what's happened here with the coronavirus and the drop in prices is going to pull a lot more capital out of the industry as you've seen -- as you've already seen which is going to exaggerate that issue. So I think on the back end of this thing we're going to find a market that eventually gets a lot shorter than we were already anticipating. Welcome Roger. Yeah. No that's something we're keeping a really close eye on is, what are the tell signs in terms of what we see. And April was significantly lower demand month than what we saw in March. And so I kind of saw that, as the depth of the coronavirus impact. If you look at kind of going forward into May -- and what we're using in terms of looking -- trying to get a view of that looking forward is sales out of our retail assets around the world and using that to see how -- what kind of demand response for people primarily around road transportation. And we are seeing improvements really across all three markets. We've seen in May volumes trending up in Europe. We see that happening in the U.S. and we see that also in Asia, although, Asia didn't drop nearly as far as Europe or the U.S. And so there are some. I'd say encouraging early signs in the transportation sector particularly road transportation. I think on aviation that's probably going to take a little bit longer. We haven't seen any uptick in that space yet. You're welcome. Take care. Well, good morning, Doug and everyone's fine here so thank you for asking. I hope the same is true with you. Look, you know -- I know you're looking for a very explicit answer. And all I would tell you is we think it's -- the dividend is an important part of the value proposition that we provide to our shareholders particularly given the base of our shareholders. It would depend on the circumstances that we see in the market and how prolonged we think those circumstances are going to exist. So, I mean, I would just tell you we're going to have to wait and see how the market plays itself out. If we find ourselves with some sustained structural deficit that says the business is going to have trouble over a much longer time period, we'd have to step back and rethink that. But frankly, we're not seeing that today. If you look at some of the early signs, I think, we see some encouragement in -- going into May. And so I think we're going to have to kind of play that by ear. The beauty of the dividend is it's flexible. We -- the Board considers that every quarter and we're obviously, looking at the macro environment looking at some of the -- kind of telltales that are out there. We've got our organization working very hard around what are some leading metrics that we can keep an eye on to see which direction things are going. And so we're going to continue to look at that and make decisions as we go forward to ensure that for the long-term, this business is strong and has a good foundation to provide continuing dividends out into the future and products that the world are going to need. Doug, let me just say, on that. Well, we're not -- I don't really look to what Shell is doing to decide our dividend policy frankly. It's a function of our investment base and the commitment that we've made to them. Well, again I know you like real specific numbers. But I would just tell you one of the principles that we had in managing the balance sheet is to make sure that we maintain capacity because as we've just seen here this quarter the market's got a lot of volatility in it. And therefore, we need to have a foundation or a base that allows us to accommodate that volatility. And we need to have access -- competitive access to the market. So we're going to make sure that we stay in a range that allows us to competitively continue -- to competitively access the debt markets when we need them and make sure that we've got a buffer that allows us to run and continue to manage the ups and downs that are not going to away in this commodity-based business. So again it's an ongoing conversation something that the Board and I spent time talking about and looking at. And we're going to kind of continue to adjust it as we go forward. I mean, the priorities that I've laid out around the investment the dividends and the balance sheet -- and I used the term earlier this morning, I used it in our Investor Day balance. We got to kind of balance it based on what we see happening in the marketplace. We -- today we've taken a position that we believe balance in what we're seeing. As the quarter moves on if things don't play out the way we think or we see something that's structurally very different than what we anticipate, we'll look at rebalancing that. It's just difficult to tell right now frankly. Good. Thank you, Doug. Take care. Good morning, Doug. Yes. Thanks Doug. Hope all is well with you. On the balancing, I think that balance is going to be a very I'll call it sector maybe company-specific point in terms of where everyone stands with respect to their balance sheet, with their capacity, their scale, their integration. So I think the balance will be different. And in my view some segments of our industry today needed better balance and I think that will manifest itself. I think there -- you got to be able to survive through these downturns and position your company to do that. So I do think there's a balance that's needed there. I also think that the demand will be there, because of the fundamental role it plays in economic growth in people's lives. And so as much as the short-term kind of swings the industry around, ultimately the demand for the products will come back and the industry is going to have to respond to that demand. And if in the short-term a lot more conservatism comes in, a lot less capital flows into the marketplace, we'll open up that supply/demand balance going forward and that will then incentivize things coming back in, and frankly, may lead to less balance in terms of what you're talking about. So I think it's really a function of the capacity and capability of companies to kind of weather through this short-term period. And I think some companies are better positioned to do that than others, which is -- probably leads you to your second point about consolidation. And I think again that opportunity exists particularly in periods like that. If you look back in time when prices get low and companies get stressed you see that tend to happen not only in our industry, but in other industries. So that's certainly a theme, which I think will resonate within the industry. Exactly how that plays itself out though I think we'll just have to wait and see. I come back to a lot of the value levers that we saw with the Exxon Mobil merger. I mean, those value levers I don't think have really changed over time. And so it's really a question of what opportunities are out there where you can see some of those probably a subset of the value levers that we saw with that. And of course, as we look at opportunities -- I've been asked this a lot of times in these calls about acquisitions. And what I've always said is we have to look and find some unique value levers to justify the deal. And if you can't do that then there's no space for the deal. And that has really been I think the underlying criteria that we've had as we've looked at acquisitions as we continue to look at acquisitions and opportunities is can we find a way of creating and extracting unique value out of some acquisition or opportunity. And that's not going to change. We continue to look for those things. And if we find them... Hey, you bet. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, Jeanine. Yes. Thanks Jeanine. So and Neil talked about this in our Investor Day as we looked at the range of flexibility that we had. And that was one of the points I think Neil tried to make was we -- even within in early March as we looked at our investments in the unconventional space that we did have opportunities to ramp down spend and investment there and still fully utilize the infrastructure that we are putting in place and making sure that we got a return on those investments. And frankly, it was pretty critical to do that and maintain scale and scale advantage in the cost. If you think more broadly about what we're trying to do in the Permian, it's really with this long supply market in mind that we've got to find a way to get the cost -- the unit cost of production in the Permian down. And the way we're approaching that is through scale and technology. We think that's absolutely critical. And so, our view is to make that investment in the Permian very competitive in an oversupplied market which I would tell you we're well on the way towards. And so, the cuts we've seen to date allow us to continue to preserve that capital efficiency. It allows us to do -- continue with the development, the cube developments to make sure we're maximizing the recovery, and it utilizes our above-surface facility. So I think that's where we're at today. And we're looking now -- and you saw in the presentation that Stephen gave with the second quarter outlook we are taking economic shut-ins in the Permian. And that's not a -- that's really a function of -- if you think about a lot of these wells that are early in their lives which just started up you get very high production rates. And from an economic -- maximizing the NPV of those wells, you're better off deferring that high production rate into a period with better pricing. And so a lot of the shut-ins that we're doing in the upstream are associated with kind of a value play around making sure that we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive to high production rates. And of course, looking forward, depending on how the market evolves, we've got the flexibility to bring a lot of those wells back on quickly and ramp up what we're doing in the unconventional space. So it is -- you all have talked about that. We've talked about it. That short-cycle investment gives us a lot of flexibility and we're certainly leveraging it. There's a lot of value there too. I would tell you, we continue to feel very good about the ability for that resource when we get it online to compete in a low-price environment. The challenge we've got today is the investment we're making to get in that position and that's kind of what's inhibiting us, but once we get into it we feel really good about operating competitively in an oversupplied market. Yeah. I think Jeanine, we'll have to watch and see how the world evolves. I mean I keep coming back to -- and I know you guys probably feel like it's a repetitive statement, but the basic drivers of energy demand have not changed with what we're seeing today. The demand drivers the fact that energy plays such a critical role in people's everyday lives and the growth of economies mean that that energy will be needed. So it's really a question of timing and the recovery. And again, I think, we're -- April is probably the depth of the impact in our industry. I hope that's true. Certainly, it's looking that way from the early signs. But we're going to have to let this kind of quarter play out. I think the second quarter will be a challenging quarter, but we'll have a better view around how the rest of the year is shaping up and we'll continue to adjust it. We've got additional flexibility to use if we want to. And if we start to conclude that based on some structural change, which frankly it's hard to see right now, but if we see that we'll adjust the plans again. You're welcome. Yeah. No. I would say, the 400 koebd that we put in Stephen's second quarter look ahead. And I would tell you the way to think about that is about two-thirds of that roughly would be in the economic category and about half of that in Kearl, and then the other half in this economic steps that we're taking in the Permian, which is really around preserving value. Kearl with a low price environment I think it's more challenged from a competitive or cost of supply basis. Permian we get higher value by deferring some of those. And so, about a third -- out of Kearl, about a third in the unconventional space and then about a third associated with restrictions put on us by the governments around the world. Sure. I know there's been a lot written about that. I would have to tell you, this has been again another really great benefit of the reorganizations that we've done along the value chain with our Upstream. We made the change in our Downstream, beginning of 2018. We made the change in the Upstream in April 2019. And so if you look today, as we headed into this, our ability to see end to end from the wellhead all the way down to the customers, I think was the best in industry frankly. Certainly, nobody had anything better in terms of that ability to see along. And so we were very early into that process making sure that we had a clear line of sight of how we would move the physicals and that we do not find logistics constraints. Of course, you know we've been investing in logistics both out of Canada and Kearl with takeaway capacity there on the rail and in type. And we've invested in the Permian and takeaway capacity there. And so we've got I think a good line of sight of where the bottlenecks are going to happen and really secure position with respect to the logistics to move the barrels. And we've applied -- our team has basically been keeping an eye on that around the world, not just out of those two resource plays, but everywhere that we lift barrel is making sure that we've got a clear line of sight of how we keep them flowing to the extent that the economics warrant that. So we have not seen the logistics constraints that others have talked about, just because of the fact that the organization was able to kind of see some of those coming and take the appropriate steps to make sure we didn't get caught with any of them. Operator, we probably have time for one more call. Good morning, Phil. Yes. Sure Phil. Good morning to you. I would say, you're absolutely -- the activity that we have, the focus that we have around restructuring the portfolio and high-grading that portfolio hasn't really changed, so the drivers and the motivation remain there. The work list that we have with respect to getting assets in the marketplace and the divestments are still in place. It's really a question of what we said all along is our ability to execute that divestment program will be a function of finding buyers who put a value on those assets, a value that's higher than what we see with them and so that we find a deal space and transact. And I think your point, which is a valid one and absolutely correct I think is going to be harder to do that in an environment like this where people are strapped of cash. So I would expect to see that divestment program slowed just because of the market dynamics and the buyer, seller -- the availability of buyers. And we're not counting on that with respect to how we think about the business and how we're going to fund the ongoing business. We have not assumed that we're going to benefit from asset sales. All of our plans are based on essentially managing with the portfolio that we have."

And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The full set of presentation slides and prepared remarks are made available on the Investor Relations section of our website earlier this morning, along with our press release. During our call this morning, Darren will provide a few additional opening comments and reference a select number of slides from that presentation, leaving more time for your questions. We expect to conclude the call at 9:30 a.m. Central Time. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2, and through the supplemental information at the end of the presentation slides on the website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thanks Stephen. It\u2019s a pleasure to share our 2021 results with you today, which demonstrates the significant progress we\u2019ve made to advance our strategy and position the company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down cycle and structural cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefit of the market recovery last year. We delivered strong financial and operating performance, significantly increased earnings and cash flow to fund our advantaged investments, reduced debt to pre-pandemic levels, and continued our long history of sharing our success with shareholders. Today, we\u2019ll outline some of our progress towards reaching our strategic goals, to lead in earnings and cash flow growth, drive to a net-zero future, build successful lower-emissions businesses, and maintain optionality in our portfolio to match the pace of the energy transition. Let me touch on a couple of key points. First, we\u2019re working to fully leverage our competitive advantages, including our scale, to drive step changes in cost and efficiency. We\u2019re also actively managing our strong portfolio and continuing our keen focus on operating performance and disciplined capital and operating spend. We\u2019re also accelerating our work to reduce emissions and drive innovations focused on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry and commercial transportation. An important part of this activity is our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions from our operations by 2050. Also important is the good progress we\u2019ve made building our Low Carbon Solutions business, which is rapidly expanding, utilizing existing policy. As you\u2019re all aware, we\u2019re also pursuing very large-scale opportunities that will give us first-mover advantage as we advocate for the new policy necessary to support these step-out projects. Our results demonstrate the benefits of the actions we\u2019ve taken. We\u2019re continuing to manage and evolve the company to further strengthen our competitive advantages, growing value through the transition, regardless of its pace. Turning now to some perspectives in 2021. As I said, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress advancing our strategy over the past year. We remained focused on safety and reliability, delivering a second consecutive year of outstanding performance. In emission reductions, we expect to meet our 2025 reduction plans four years early. That led us to set even more aggressive plans for 2030. The experience we gained developing reduction roadmaps for our assets gives us confidence for what we can ultimately achieve. This helped form the basis of our recently announced ambition to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations by 2050. Of course, a big part of our work in this area involved our Low Carbon Solutions business. As I mentioned, this new business has made exceptional progress building a large inventory of new business opportunities with a focus on carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels. Importantly, we\u2019re also addressing emissions by providing high-performance products that deliver solutions to help our customers reduce their emissions. Demand for these products was very strong in 2021, enabling 7% growth in our performance product volumes. This helped drive record annual earnings in our Chemical business. Strengthening our portfolio across all of our businesses continues to be a key part of our strategic focus to increase shareholder returns. To that end, we had more exploration success in Guyana with six discoveries in 2021 and two additional discoveries already this year. This has expanded the estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek block to more than 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels and we\u2019re on schedule to start production this quarter at Liza Phase 2.  In the Permian, we continued to drive improvements in drilling and completions, increasing average production by nearly 100,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to approximately 460,000. We started up the Corpus Christi Chemical facility under budget and ahead of schedule. And we\u2019ve continued to monetize non-core assets, generating more than $3 billion of cash proceeds from divestments during the year. Our actions are yielding strong results and, as I said, positioned us to benefit from demand recovery. We grew earnings to $23 billion and drove nearly $2 billion of structural efficiencies in 2021 on top of the $3 billion the year before. This puts us in a good position to significantly exceed our goal of $6 billion of structural cost savings per year by 2023 relative to 2019. We maintained our disciplined approach to investments, focused on competitively advantaged low cost of supply opportunities and on growing our portfolio of high-value products. CapEx was $16.6 billion for the year, which was near the low end of our guidance. As a result of our cost reductions, improved efficiency, and capital discipline, we\u2019ve lowered our Brent breakeven price to $41 per barrel. We\u2019re continuing to drive that down even more, expecting to average $35 per barrel between now and 2027. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $48 billion, the highest since 2012. We used the available cash to restore our balance sheet, essentially paying back what we borrowed in 2020, reducing our debt-to-capital ratio to about 21%. As a result of our restored financial strength, we increased the annual dividend for the 39th consecutive year and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that started last month. Overall, a strong list of accomplishments. Now looking ahead to this year. Our plan is robust and progresses our strategic objectives. I\u2019ll highlight a few key items on this page. First, we will increase our competitively advantaged, low cost of supply production with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 in Guyana and the Coral LNG development in Mozambique. The same is true for the Permian, where our focus remains on driving further capital efficiency and high-value growth. We\u2019re already ramping up manufacturing at Corpus Christi and expecting to start up our Baton Rouge polypropylene expansion later this year. These projects will continue to grow production of our high-value chemical performance products. We\u2019re applying the same capabilities and expertise developed over decades to progress our net zero ambitions and grow our low carbon solutions business. In that business, we expect to reach final investment decisions on large-scale carbon capture and storage projects at La Barge, Wyoming, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We\u2019re continuing to advance the flagship carbon capture opportunity in Houston. It now has 14 participating companies and has potential to capture up to 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. We also anticipate beginning to lift renewable diesel from our agreement with Global Clean Energy\u2019s biorefinery in California later this year, as well as making a final investment decision on our renewable diesel project at our Strathcona refinery in Canada, expanding our lower emissions fuels offering. And finally, we expect to further strengthen our balance sheet and progress our share repurchase program while continuing to retain capital flexibility and optionality to adapt to market conditions and opportunities. Leveraging our core competitive advantages, we\u2019re well positioned for future success, irrespective of the path or pace. We have the flexibility to shift resources between our traditional and low-carbon businesses at any rate required. This provides a lot of optionality and positions us to lead industry in the energy transition and in earnings and cash flow growth. We thank you for joining us today and look forward to sharing more with you during our Investor Day on March 2. Unfortunately, because of ongoing COVID considerations, we\u2019ll conduct the events virtually again this year. We do look forward to the day when we can get back to hosting you all in-person. Before we take your questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Stephen for his leadership and significant contributions. As after 30 years of service, he will be retiring at the end of this month. I wish Stephen and his wife, Kim, the very best. You\u2019ll be missed. I\u2019d also like to welcome Jennifer Driscoll, who will be joining later this month as our Vice President of Investor Relations.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Darren. Operator, please open the phone lines for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Congrats, Stephen, on your retirement.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: First question for Kathy on capital allocation, great to see the net debt reduction here in the fourth quarter, well ahead of our expectations and the start-up of share buybacks in January. As you look at 2022, with oil prices where they are, how are you thinking about the pace of the share buybacks and the desire to take leverage below this 20% to 25% target given the pace and progress you made in the fourth quarter?\nKathy Mikells: Sure. So look, our capital allocation priorities remain the same, right? First, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re investing in the high-return assets and products across the business from Guyana to chemical performance products to biofuel. Second, really continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. I talked about on the third quarter, and we continue to look out to our term debt maturities with an eye to paying those down in 2022 and continuing to sustain the strong dividend that we have and then, obviously, returning further available cash to shareholders. We would have started the $10 billion share repurchase program at the beginning of the year, what I would have described as an equal pay against the 24-month longer-term time frame. As we assess both our year-end results, where we ended up in terms of net debt looking at the continued positive market environment, that would cause us to increase the pace of the share repurchase program. And as I stand here today, I\u2019d say increasing the pace with the faster end of that 12- to 24-month pace in mind. We will continue to evaluate the program and the pace throughout the year. It\u2019s one thing to sit here today and sit in what are pretty favorable market conditions, but we\u2019ll just have to see how the year pans out. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it right now.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. No, that makes a lot of time. Thanks for that color. And then my second question, I know you\u2019ll give a more detailed update in March at the Analyst Day, but just any thoughts around 2022 production targets considering the \u2013 some of the recently closed asset sales, just any moving pieces, Permian or otherwise? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes. I\u2019ll take that, Phil. Good morning. As you know, one of the primary objectives we\u2019ve had in looking at the portfolio is less about volume and volume targets and more about the quality and profitability of the barrels that we\u2019re producing. So, we\u2019ve been aggressively trying to high-grade the portfolio across our businesses. And that\u2019s certainly true in the upstream, which led to the discussion we had a couple of years ago with respect to the divestment program, which continues to pay dividends and will continue to progress. And then the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Guyana and Permian and Brazil. And so I would expect that volumes are fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen this year. And \u2013 but the mix within that volume profile will continue to improve and the earnings per barrel will continue to improve, and that\u2019s been the focus. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll continue \u2013 you\u2019ll continue to see the \u2013 what I\u2019ll say, the quality of the barrels or profitability of the barrels increase. And then with time, as you head out in the later years, you\u2019ll see volumes grow with that improved quality mix.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Great. That makes sense. Thanks a lot.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, there, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to reference some of your comments made on the structural cost reduction. You talked about those benefits continuing into 2023. I was just wondering if you could balance that, again, the cost inflation we\u2019re seeing across various items, your raw materials, logistics, labor, et cetera, can you talk about the net impact of those? And I have a follow-on on a different topic.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Good morning, Biraj. So we talked some time ago about a $6 billion structural reduction through 2023. As we work through 2021, and drove additional improvements within the business, we\u2019ve extended that restructural cost reduction. We expect, as I said this morning earlier, kind of around $2 billion again in 2022 and another $2 billion in 2023, so more than exceeding the level that we thought about and talked about last year. That obviously is the structural side of the equation in terms of reducing cost. The counterweight then is the inflation and Forex and some of the pressures that we\u2019re seeing. In the short-term, we were in the down cycle. We recognize that there would be a return and there would be growth, and that would put pressure on prices. And so we, in anticipation of that, tried to manage many of our contracts and the work that we are doing to maintain a level of cost and to minimize escalation as we headed into 2021 and into 2022, and that\u2019s paying off. We\u2019ve managed to mitigate quite a bit of that inflation. Obviously, as time goes on, we\u2019ll start to see more of that. And our expectation is the businesses will work to offset that inflation growth. And longer-term, our objective is, as we grow the business with the investments that we\u2019re making in Chemical business, Chemical facilities and some of the changes that we\u2019re making in our downstream operations, and then as we grow some of the upstream businesses, we\u2019ll offset all that increased cost with structural efficiencies.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay, understood. That\u2019s very helpful. The second question is actually asset specific. I\u2019ve been looking at some of the export data at Papua New Guinea over the last few months, and it looks like that asset is performing extremely well and above nameplate capacity. I was wondering if you could talk about whether there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019re doing to increase capacity there? And maybe any color on how much of those exports are contracted versus part would be helpful, too?\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. I think, again, what we\u2019re seeing in Papua New Guinea, and frankly, it\u2019s been replicated in other parts of the company is what we\u2019ve been talking about, which is leveraging the full capabilities of the organization. One of the changes that we\u2019ve made over time here is we brought a lot of the optimization skills and techniques that we\u2019ve historically used in our downstream businesses, and our refineries where you\u2019re eking out pennies on the barrel to be successful. And taking that technology and approach to some of our upstream assets and sharing that technology and working with the upstream teams to improve the productivity of the assets on the ground, that\u2019s paying off really all around the world where we\u2019re applying that technique. And what you\u2019re seeing in Papua New Guinea is that\u2019s part of the driver \u2013 what the driver of that increase on top of just hard work by that operating team to maintain reliability and to run that plant to its constraints. And so I think it\u2019s the combination of those two things. And our expectation, we\u2019ve seen that in Chemical as well. As we brought those plants up, we\u2019ve been able to run above the nameplate capacity, just, again, with the optimization and the hard work of the operating team. So we\u2019ve kind of have an expectation as we bring new assets on that those operating teams figure out unique ways to get beyond constraints and improve the performance.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to touch on the CapEx guidance, provided a range of $21 billion to $24 billion, which is appreciated. Can you just discuss how you think about what determines the low end and the high end of that range for this year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nKathy Mikells: Sure. So overall, I think as you consider the range that we\u2019ve given, I\u2019d kind of point to starting the year with an expectation of being more towards the center of the range, and then we\u2019ll see, ultimately, how the projects and the big projects proceed is probably the biggest indicator and whether any new projects ultimately come online, which we would always be maintaining some level of flexibility for. Unsurprisingly, with the size of our Upstream business relative to Downstream and Chemicals, the biggest increase year-over-year comes from overall, the Upstream business and further spending in Guyana, further spending in unconventional, especially the Permian, beginning to up-weight our spending overall on our own emission reductions. And again, the Permian would be another place that we\u2019re particularly focused, restarting paused projects that we had in the Downstream and then you\u2019ll be well aware of the big projects that we have ongoing in Chemicals. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the difference. And I\u2019d say how we think about landing towards the middle versus a different end within that range. But obviously, tightening the range relative to the range that we\u2019ve given over a longer period of time, which is the $20 billion to $25 billion.\nJason Gabelman: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And my second question, I wanted to touch on the performance products within Chem. You\u2019ve often discussed that\u2019s a driver of your earnings growth over the next few years and high grading the business. And so I just wanted to hopefully get some context around the comment about 7% growth in Performance Products volumes, can you help us understand what types of earnings uplift that provides, and how you think about earnings growth within that Performance Products business moving forward?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. So I\u2019d go back to the corporate plan disclosures we had where we talked about both within Chem and within Downstream, our focus on growing high-value, higher-margin projects, which would include low-emission fuels, and it would include high-performance lubricants in our lubricants portfolio as well as what we would describe as Chemical performance products and looking to double the volume of those products kind of over the planned period. And ultimately, as we look at the combination of Downstream and Chem over that period of time, looking to triple earnings and so it is a strong component of what sits behind tripling earnings, but I\u2019d also say, and this comes through our breakeven analysis, continuing to reduce the structural costs within the business across all elements of the business also are a driver of that increased cash flow and earnings power. So that\u2019s how I would think about how we\u2019re looking to continue to upgrade the mix within both Downstream and Chemical.\nDarren Woods: And maybe just a little bit of color commentary with respect to when we talk about performance, say, in the chemical company, what drives that and it\u2019s built on a pretty fundamental competitive advantage with respect to our technology capabilities and the work that we do with catalyst. And the developments that we\u2019ve made give many of our chemical products unique characteristics, characteristics in use. So that\u2019s a really important part of the value equation. And then we have invested in the science and technology to work with customers on applications to take advantage of those unique properties. And we have labs in China and other places around the world to support our customers. And the value and use of that improved performance then is shared with customers and ourselves, which gives that uplift on our performance products.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. Thanks for the answer.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Well, thanks good morning. Shocking news this morning, congratulations, Stephen, we will miss you indeed. I look forward to chatting with you before you leave. So guys, I wonder if I could go to Slide 12 and just ask you to walk through a little bit more color on the breakeven guidance that you\u2019re talking about. And my specific question is, you\u2019re talking about an average breakeven between $22 billion and $27 billion, but a lot of your higher-margin projects come on at the back end of that period, specifically Guyana. So what does the breakeven look like at the end of the period as opposed to the average?\nKathy Mikells: So you\u2019re probably asking questions that I\u2019ll dive into a bit more detail when we get to Investor Day, Doug, but you\u2019re right. What we walked through on this slide and specifically on the bottom of the slide, where we did the walk from our current breakeven to that average in $22 billion to $27 billion of $35 billion. What I would tell you is, as a result of the comment with regard to the portfolio improvement, continuing to take place over time. As you would expect, we start out at the higher end and then move to the lower end. So I would tell you our progress, while not exactly linear, continues to be fairly consistent over that period of time. And we\u2019ll definitely dive into that a bit further when we get to Investor Day.\nDarren Woods: And I\u2019d add Doug, that the high end of that range is consistent with what we\u2019re showing in 2021.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. So it\u2019s probably below 35% as the bottom line at the end of the period. Arithmetically, would have to be, right? Okay. Alright, thank you. My follow-up is actually \u2013 I guess, it\u2019s a kind of a cash distribution question. A $0.01 dividend increase you basically did what Chevron did five-years ago. But they didn\u2019t have the growth story. The free cash trajectory that we see is pretty significant this year beyond what you\u2019ve laid out even with the buyback. So my question is, could we ever see Exxon do like an interim dividend increase? Or put differently, what are you going to do with all the cash?\nKathy Mikells: I guess; a, I\u2019m not going to get out in front of the Board\u2019s decision with regard to further distributions to shareholders. We\u2019ve talked previously as we\u2019ve looked at our dividend that some of the metrics that we look at is both our dividend yield relative to our peers\u2019 dividend yield relative to, I\u2019ll call it, the total dividend yield on average on the market as well as looking at our payout ratio, our overall dividend size is larger than what our peers would be, and we have been more towards the top end of the range, both on yield as well as on payout ratio. Obviously, as we see the improved overall results at the company, that naturally is starting to impact both of those metrics, which we\u2019ll consider \u2013 continue to be considered as the Board looks to make decisions going forward. But I\u2019d say, as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty good about what our dividend yield is and its competitiveness.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And I would add, Doug, that the Board evaluates that quarterly. So it\u2019s an ongoing discussion. We don\u2019t have a fixed time period. It\u2019s a function of the things that Kathy talked about.\nDoug Leggate: Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and Stephen, congrats on the retirement.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Devin.\nDevin McDermott: So my first question is on some of the structural cost efficiencies. You\u2019ve all done a great job in bringing this to fruition here over the last few years and are still talking about exceeding the $6 billion structural target by 2023. I can\u2019t help to notice that in the waterfall chart on longer-term breakevens, you\u2019re showing an incremental $5 billion of cost reductions relative to 2021 levels, you\u2019d imply pretty significant increase in that longer-term target. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the incremental opportunities that you identified? And I\u2019d imagine that some of the structural changes at the corporate level that you\u2019ve announced recently are part of that?\nDarren Woods: Sure. And just to be clear on the chart that Kathy walked folks through the five, that we\u2019re showing on that bottom chart is dollars per barrel, it\u2019s not billions of dollars. So be clear on that.\nDevin McDermott: Understood.\nDarren Woods: And so I think the heart of the reductions that you\u2019re seeing as we go forward is a function of capturing the best of what the corporation can bring to bear in each one of our businesses. Just a little bit of background, Devin. We started with process safety and basically, several years ago, launched an effort to take the best thinking that we had in each of our businesses, bring that together, come up with one approach to managing process safety and then roll that out across the organization. That has resulted in eliminating a lot of duplicate or programs running in parallel that brings cost. So we\u2019ve saved with respect to the work that we are doing in that space. But much, much more importantly, we improved our results and have significantly reduced process safety events. And so we\u2019re continuing down that path. But it highlighted the strength of kind of capturing the learnings that have occurred across our different businesses over the decades. And the quality thinking that we have in each of our organizations and bringing those experts together and having them address the problem on a corporate-wide basis is delivering good results. We saw the same thing with reliability when we brought, again, the best thinking of the corporation across the different operating companies together to solve the challenge of how do we improve reliability structurally and sustainably across all of our businesses. This team came up with ideas and implementations that, once again, significantly lowered our cost, and is improving our performance. And so that is the kind of the recipe that we\u2019re executing across a very wide range of opportunities. We\u2019re bringing the maintenance activities and thinking about the above-site maintenance, how you \u2013 what are the price processes, how do you go about that into that same type of approach, leveraging the best of the corporation, which we expect to see significant improvements in our maintenance and turnaround spend. Technology and engineering that the new company or the new group that we\u2019re forming is basically, again, doing the same thing, best capabilities from each of our businesses. We have technology functions within each of our companies. We\u2019re bringing those things together, same with engineering. And we, again, expect to end up doing things much more cost efficiently for much more effect. And that \u2013 so the savings that we see going forward are really the result of a lot of different things being applied across a huge scale of our operations to significantly reduce cost. And there are other opportunities in the future. Think about supply chain, think about some of the financial transactions as we\u2019ve, over the course of 2018 and 2019, realigned our businesses and work processes so that now, as you look across our different businesses, we\u2019re conducting businesses in a very similar back office approach, so to speak, that gives us an opportunity to capture the synergies that exist between those. So a really broad range of opportunities as we kind of open the doors between the different businesses across our corporation, take the best that each has to offer, bring those together and come up with an answer that\u2019s better than anyone on its own. And I think that, again, plays to this the competitive advantages that I\u2019ve been talking about since taking this job around leveraging our scale, leveraging the integration of our businesses, leveraging the functional excellence that each of these companies have developed, how do we better take advantage of that, and then leveraging our technology and bringing that all together by leveraging the capabilities of our people. So that recipe is beginning to pay off. And frankly, hard to see where we \u2013 where that ends with respect to the improvements that we\u2019ve got lined up for the business.\nDevin McDermott: Very helpful. Thank you. And my second question is on M&A. In addition to the high return investment opportunity you highlight selective M&A as an opportunity in the slide deck. I was just wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail about what strategically you\u2019d be looking for at this point in time?\nDarren Woods: I\u2019ll answer that, and then if Kathy has anything to add, I\u2019ll turn it over to her. But as we\u2019ve talked about for quite some time, we do have an ongoing active M&A group that \u2013 but we look for things that \u2013 where we can and bring it into our portfolio add unique value, grow unique value. So it\u2019s got to be something that \u2013 where we feel like there\u2019s a synergy or a fit with what we\u2019re currently doing to lever that value up and see accretion very early on. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at that, and we look at it across all of our businesses for opportunities. And you\u2019ve seen that kind of play out in the Chemical business here with an acquisition last year. You\u2019ve seen it play out in our Downstream business. And so I think that\u2019s a very active program. But bottom line is, we\u2019ve got to look at what that opportunity looks like in the context of what ExxonMobil can bring to bear, then make sure that we\u2019re in a position to effectively leverage our core competencies, skill sets and capabilities to grow value beyond what either one companies could do independently. And that\u2019s how we assess and think about that. Kathy, anything to add?\nKathy Mikells: The only other thing I\u2019d add is in the low-carbon emission space, we\u2019re also actively assessing things, and we would have discussed the fact that we made an investment in BioJet, I\u2019ll call it a biodiesel company, that\u2019s out in Norway where we also have an off-take agreement. So we continue to look at opportunities in that space as well.\nDevin McDermott: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Welcome.\nOperator: Next question will be from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Good morning, everybody, and congrats, Stephen. Thank you. So my first question is on the emissions statement that you made, where you\u2019re four years ahead of your target for 2025. It\u2019s interesting because the final data is not out yet, but I suspect that global emissions hit a record in 2021 just based on the amount of coal that came through the monthly supply numbers. And a lot of execution in the low carbon business is around policy and communicating to regulators what\u2019s most beneficial for society. So in the context of Exxon\u2019s emissions starting to fall and global emissions still rising, has \u2013 do you feel like your seat at the table has potentially improved or your influence is getting stronger? Or is it still very early in the process?\nDarren Woods: Well, I think \u2013 it\u2019s a great question, Sam. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, this is a really complicated space and it deals with a really important part of people\u2019s lives and the resiliency of the economies around the world. So I think I\u2019ve been encouraged frankly by the growth in terms of the folks who are working in this space and actively thinking through how best to achieve and address what we\u2019ve been talking about for some time to do a challenge. And I think there\u2019s a growing recognition and a growing acceptance of the need for a variety of solutions and approaches to strike that balance correctly and make sure that we make progress on lowering emissions. But at the same time, don\u2019t compromise the quality of people\u2019s lives. And I think what we\u2019re seeing play out today in Europe, certainly I think has made that point clear in terms of some of the challenges associated with moving quickly in this space or not thinking through all the potential downsides and unintended consequences. We\u2019ve seen that here in the U.S. with some of the tightness of supply. And so that is the challenge. We are committed to helping society make that reduction. We are working hard to catalyze the right kind of policy to incentivize and to drive emissions down faster, while at the same time protecting people\u2019s standard of living and livelihoods. There are options to do that. It does require some policy in different places, and we\u2019re seeing some of that policy manifest itself in some of the countries around the world, which underpins the work that we\u2019re doing in low carbon solutions. And that\u2019s a global business with opportunities that we see developing all around the planet and many, many countries and there\u2019s policy in place today to support those investments, which is what\u2019s driving certainly in the early days. And then that, I think those policies and investments set good examples for other countries to consider and to think about in line with the needs of their constituencies. So I am encouraged. I do feel like there\u2019s a better conversation happening, obviously, a long ways to go there and lot of work to be done both from a policy standpoint as well as from the companies participating in the market.\nSam Margolin: Thank you. And then so this is a follow-up about the low carbon solutions organization in the company. A lot of the efforts there are connected to existing operations, right, carbon capture on facilities or biofuels coming off of refinery parks. And so is the intent to fully disaggregate all of that from the base business so that we can kind of map the revenue trend line and associate that with an emissions abatement number and watch our progress that way? Or is that more of an organizational function and not necessarily a financial segment yet? Thank you.\nKathy Mikells: So I\u2019d say, right now, our focus is on building that third-party business, right? We have, I\u2019d say, a huge number of projects in the pipeline. We feel very good about the progress that\u2019s been made in a pretty short period of time since we\u2019ve launched the low carbon submission business, but we also have the overall activities in terms of reducing our own emissions. And those activities are really the prime accountability of the business lines. And so there\u2019s an overall, I\u2019ll call it, corporate coordination, best practice role that\u2019s taking place there. That\u2019s part of what enabled us to actually expect to meet the 2025 goals ahead of time. So when we talk about our overall efforts as it relates to emissions in their entirety, we\u2019re always talking about what we\u2019re doing within our own four walls and then what we\u2019re doing to help reduce, I\u2019ll call it, our customers\u2019 emissions, or more broadly, what the company does in terms of the products and technologies that it offers in helping to reduce society\u2019s emissions with lower life cycle emission type product. So that\u2019s how we think about it. And certainly, first and foremost, that third-party business is something we\u2019re focused on building today. So we are not expecting that, that\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ll call it, new segment that we\u2019re disclosing as opposed to just focusing on building that business, which is still in its early stages.\nDarren Woods: But you can imagine, if you think about looking across more in our global portfolio and then opportunities with customers or third parties is understanding what\u2019s the lowest cost of abatement? How much CO2 can you reduce for the lowest dollar spent? That group has a good perspective that we\u2019re leveraging across all the opportunities, whether they\u2019re internal or external. And frankly, if you look at the portfolio of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at as a company, there\u2019s a really good mix between what we\u2019re going to be doing at our own facilities, opportunities to provide lower emissions products for our customers and then opportunities to reduce industry-wide CO2 emissions. So it\u2019s got a good mix today. We\u2019re very early in this process. I mean, this is a very dynamic space. If you think back a couple of years ago, hydrogen and carbon capture and frankly, even biofuels were struggling to kind of be in the mix in terms of potential solutions. Whereas, today, I think people recognize the importance they\u2019re going to play going forward. And so I would just say it\u2019s rapidly evolving. There\u2019s a lot of interest. We\u2019ve certainly had a lot of interest expressed in our business and the opportunities we\u2019re pursuing. So I would say, we\u2019ll keep talking about that. You\u2019ll see that business grow with time as places around the world take the steps to make the necessary reductions.\nSam Margolin: Thanks. By the way it\u2019s Lunar New Year, and it\u2019s the Year of the Tiger. So that seems potentially significant. So thank you.\nDarren Woods: I am glad to hear that.\nSam Margolin: Have a good one.\nDarren Woods: You too.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, good morning team and congrats on strong results and congrats to you, Stephen, on your retirement here. A couple of questions for you. The first is on the Permian. Darren, can you just provide an update on how you\u2019re thinking about prosecuting that asset? We heard from Chevron. They\u2019re thinking about 10% type of growth in the Permian in 2022 versus 2021, how are you thinking about volume growth? And then in general, what is the right approach to maximizing value from the Permian relative to what you were talking about a couple of years ago?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure, Neil. I think maybe I\u2019ll start with where you ended, which is what we were talking about a couple of years ago, which you recall, we talked about, I think the terms I used where right now, the industry is playing a short game, and we\u2019re a long ball hitter. And how do you do \u2013 how do you take the long ball game into the unconventional space? And that led to the approach that Neil Chapman has talked about over the last couple of years with respect to setting up more of a manufacturing approach and driving efficiencies and driving technology applications into that \u2013 those developments. And that has worked very, very well. And we\u2019re seeing the results of that. So we grew our Permian production from 2020 to 2021 by over 25%. Our expectation as we go into 2022 is to grow another 25%, and that\u2019s doing that with a very tight control on capital. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing the game, and we continue to look at within our \u2013 the approach that we outlined a couple of years ago, and the success that we\u2019ve seen with that and bringing to bear a lot of the technology and application expertise, I think drilling and reservoir management that the rest of the corporation has really seeing the benefits of that. We\u2019re going to make sure that we stay in that envelope. And obviously, as we progress production and development, new horizons are opening up, and we\u2019ve got more delineation work to do that will continue to kind of grow the understanding of where the opportunities are. And we\u2019ll progress those in the context of staying within that concept that we\u2019ve laid out, which we\u2019re seeing allows us to bring barrels to market at a very low cost. And that\u2019s going to be an important part of the equation, maintaining that low-cost, high-value operation.\nNeil Mehta: Do you have a number in mind from a volume perspective as you think about this year?\nDarren Woods: So this year, I think we\u2019re going to be 25% up. We expect to be 25% up from 2021, which is consistent with how \u2013 the increase that we saw from 2020 to 2021.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. Very helpful. And then I really like this exhibit \u2013 or Page 12 of the slide with the breakevens. And I know we spent a lot of time on it already on the cost and the volume side, but the big number here is mix, the $9 a barrel. Can you spend some time talking about the composition of it? How much of it is Upstream versus Fuel versus Chemicals? And any more granularity that we can expect at the Analyst Day to help us break down the mix shift that you\u2019re seeing in the business?\nKathy Mikells: Sure. So look, overall, the business composition, by its nature, is heavy Upstream relative to Downstream and Chem. So as you think about that mix, all of the businesses are contributing to the favorable mix. Upstream has an outsized contribution. We talked about in our strategic plan that 70% of those investments were in, I\u2019ll call it, the strategic Upstream development area, so Guyana, Permian, Brazil, bringing on more LNG, those are really what are fueling, I would call, the Upstream improvement in the portfolio. And then we also talked about, by the time we get to 2027 in Downstream and Chem over 40% of the earnings coming from those high-value, high-performance products. So you do get a mixture, overall, but obviously, a very big change overall in the portfolio coming from the Upstream. And, overall, that\u2019s what the big drivers are. We\u2019ve talked about 50% of our volume from post-2020 start-ups in 2027 from the Upstream. So just to give you another stat, in terms of how significant the mix change is there.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Darren, Kathy.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Hi. Thank you. First, Stephen, thank you for the help and congratulations and wish you a wonderful retirement. And that two questions, please. I think, for Darren, you guys have just announced sort of a [indiscernible] restructuring. But historically that your Chemical, and we\u2019re finding is already wanting as maybe as coordinated as anyone, I mean 70%, I think, of your chemical facility linked to \u2013 directly to your refinery operation. And you\u2019re always in the management committee that have an executive sort of overseeing both chemical and refining. So with this structural change, are we talking about major headcount reduction? Is that the rationale behind? Or how exactly the topic realignment really changing the way how \u2013 what consider probably really seamless and one of the best in the industry in coordinating between Chemical and Refining? I mean, how is that really going to change that port and further improve? And let me after that, then I will ask the second question.\nDarren Woods: Okay. Yes. So I think a good observation, and I would echo the points you made, which is, if you look at our Chemical and Downstream business. Historically, they have been very well coordinated, I think, amongst the best within the industry. I would say, though, there\u2019s a difference between coordinating between two owners and then having a single owner. And \u2013 we really see the opportunity as \u2013 to have one set of management overlooking those businesses and making sure that we\u2019re prioritizing across those businesses and those resources, making sure that we\u2019re prioritizing not only the investments that we\u2019re making in the facilities, but the allocation of the resources, our technical resources, our engineering resources and pursuing the highest priority payout opportunities across those two. And it\u2019s difficult to do today across two separate organizations. This will improve upon that. So we\u2019ve got a good base case. We think we\u2019re going to make this even better. And we\u2019ve demonstrated the power of that to ourselves, frankly, in a couple of previous organizational changes. I\u2019ll just take the Upstream business, when you think about the functional companies that we had in our Upstream business, many of them, working very closely together and coordinating. We\u2019ve then consolidated all those businesses from \u2013 from seven, three, two and now down to one. As we step through each of those, despite what I would say is the best intention of the organizations and working collaboratively together, you get a step change in performance and opportunity to reduce cost and becoming more efficient as you consolidate those. And so we\u2019re going to see, we believe, the same opportunity within the Downstream in the Chemical portfolio. The other point I would make, which I don\u2019t want to go unrecognized is by taking and centralizing what I will call a service delivery processes out of those businesses and, again, bringing the best corporation has to offer and then high grading the thinking there, as I talked about with process, safety and reliability, doing that in maintenance, we think is going to drive a step change improvement with respect to how we execute maintenance across the entire portfolio. So there\u2019s this opportunity to consolidate expertise and then leverage that across all of our operating companies. And so those two things, I think, are going to be very, very critical. And the third point I would make with respect to headcount reductions, that\u2019s not what we see driving this improvement opportunity. We made those tough decisions back in 2020. We recognized how hard that was going to be on the organization. And we stretched ourselves to make sure that when we put together our plans for that, we as best as possible, comprehended what was to come and made this a onetime deal as much as we can, and therefore stretch ourselves to then move the organization to the level of efficiency that we need to support a lower staffing. And that\u2019s the work that we\u2019ve been doing. And then obviously, as attrition has occurred within our company and the industry more broadly and across the economy as a whole, we\u2019ve been very thoughtful and cautious about what positions we fill and how we manage that attrition, again, continuing to think through opportunities to get more efficient and take advantage of the attrition to make sure that we\u2019re managing our staffing in line with what we see as the ultimate opportunity. When you put all that together, we feel like we\u2019re in a fairly good position to execute this and not have the kind of one-off large redundancy programs that we went through in 2020.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Thank you. And the second question maybe is for Kathy, that at 20%, 21% debt-to-capital at a $90 oil price, obviously, is extremely comfortable and one will argue that maybe it\u2019s low lease, but the volatility in the market is unpredictable. So from that standpoint, given you are generating a lot of free cash, should we continue to put a portion of that into the balance sheet, into the cash until you reach maybe in also conservative such as zero net debt? That \u2013 I mean if you look at in 2020, if you have a zero net debt entering into the downturn, that tremendous opportunity, whether it\u2019s from buyback or other things that you can do. So is that a reasonable approach for a business as unpredictable and volatile as oil and gas? Or do you think that\u2019s just building not the efficient use of capital structure? And on the side, if quickly, if I can sneak in is, can you talk about your U.S. cash tax payment position over the next several years? Thank you.\nKathy Mikells: Okay. So overall, we would absolutely agree that during the best part of the cycle, we need to be really restoring our balance sheet and giving ourselves plenty of flexibility to contemplate what\u2019s ultimately going to be the down part of the cycle, which is difficult to call. You would have heard me make commentary that we are going to further reduce our debt. We certainly think getting to the low end of, I\u2019ll call it, the total debt to cap range is something that we\u2019re absolutely targeting and expecting to achieve this year. And relative to where we\u2019ve been historically, I\u2019d say carrying a bit more cash is within the expectation as well. So I would say we\u2019re very aligned in understanding that during the top part of the cycle, we really want to make sure that we\u2019ve built in a whole lot of flexibility and completely restored our balance sheet, continue to have really strong credit ratings. We wouldn\u2019t, today, sit here and say, we think we need to have zero net debt or carry zero debt overall. And that does serve also as a little bit of an offset against inflationary pressure to some extent. So I\u2019d say we feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re getting the balance right in both ensuring we have a strong balance sheet and plenty of liquidity, and also then during this part of the cycle, making sure that we have a path forward to continue to have that flexibility and return excess cash within our capital allocation priorities to shareholders.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And I would add, Paul, I don\u2019t think you have to go too far back in time to just test how resilient the strategy that we had in place with respect to capital structure was. I mean 2020, in the pandemic, and we saw the worst conditions in this industry in living memory. And the fact that we managed through that extreme set of circumstances, maintained our commitment to our shareholders, continued to pay dividend, managed our capital program and basically kept all those projects that we were pursuing alive and slowed some of those down, paused and kept others going, that balance that we struck going through those extreme challenging times. I think demonstrated the robustness of the approach that we are pursuing.\nKathy Mikells: And then I\u2019ll just come back to your second question. I\u2019d say, as we look forward in the near term, just the next few years out, we don\u2019t really see our U.S. cash kind of tax position changing, but that is with a big caveat that there\u2019s obviously been a lot coming forward in Congress with respect to potential tax changes. And while the bill back better bill did not kind of ultimately go through, I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely off the table in terms of coming back and seeing something smaller, but likely to still have various tax provisions in it. But that\u2019s how you should think about it for the moment before we see any other legislative changes.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nStephen Littleton: Operator, we probably have time for one more caller.\nOperator: Okay. We\u2019ll take that last call will be Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Sneaking me and here at the end. I\u2019d like to ask, international gas was exceptionally strong. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to understand why, but I was curious as we look between LNG, domestic sales wherever those occurred, and then you talked about building up a trading organization. And I was curious if that was a positive contributor this quarter?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Well, I think the story around natural gas is pretty well understood with respect to the tightness that we\u2019re seeing. And the majority of our sales of gas are contracted under long-term contracts. And \u2013 so limited opportunities to make significant changes in the short term. I would say that we do have a very active trading program, and we continue to grow that. And our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to grow that. And so I think that\u2019s going to play a bigger role as we go forward. But I don\u2019t think as you look at today\u2019s results, it\u2019s \u2013 the value that you\u2019re seeing is basically being driven primarily by the base business.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then any changes in terms of your LNG outlook, particular projects? I know there\u2019s been talk of bidding on some things in Asia Pac market or East Asia, maybe I should say, in terms of new facilities. Just curious if there\u2019s been movement there? You talked a little earlier about the outlook with PNG. But whether it\u2019s Middle East, Asia or Gulf Coast, just curious in terms of expansion?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would say there, nothing has changed per se. I think we have as, a fairly broad portfolio of opportunities that we\u2019ve been working and we continue to work those. And if we can find \u2013 those projects, which deliver the kind of returns at the cost of supply that we think is needed to compete over a very broad range of future scenarios that we\u2019ll pursue those. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. And I would just say the work that we\u2019re doing in that space today is consistent with the work we\u2019ve been doing for some time now. There are opportunities out there that we\u2019re evaluating, but they need to be competitive in the portfolio, and they need to be competitive long term across a very wide range of future scenarios.\nKathy Mikells: And no change with the big projects that we\u2019re progressing. Obviously, we\u2019ve got the Mozambique Coral floating LNG projects, still expected start up towards the end of this year and continuing to progress the Golden Pass project.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you and good luck, Stephen in your retirement.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you very much Roger. I also like to thank all of you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. I also like to thank you for the opportunity to work with you over the past couple of years and look forward to introducing you to Jennifer. So with that, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. And thank you and please stay safe.\nDarren Woods: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thanks Stephen. It's a pleasure to share our 2021 results with you today, which demonstrates the significant progress we've made to advance our strategy and position the company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down cycle and structural cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefit of the market recovery last year. We delivered strong financial and operating performance, significantly increased earnings and cash flow to fund our advantaged investments, reduced debt to pre-pandemic levels, and continued our long history of sharing our success with shareholders. Today, we'll outline some of our progress towards reaching our strategic goals, to lead in earnings and cash flow growth, drive to a net-zero future, build successful lower-emissions businesses, and maintain optionality in our portfolio to match the pace of the energy transition. Let me touch on a couple of key points. First, we're working to fully leverage our competitive advantages, including our scale, to drive step changes in cost and efficiency. We're also actively managing our strong portfolio and continuing our keen focus on operating performance and disciplined capital and operating spend. We're also accelerating our work to reduce emissions and drive innovations focused on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry and commercial transportation. An important part of this activity is our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions from our operations by 2050. Also important is the good progress we've made building our Low Carbon Solutions business, which is rapidly expanding, utilizing existing policy. As you're all aware, we're also pursuing very large-scale opportunities that will give us first-mover advantage as we advocate for the new policy necessary to support these step-out projects. Our results demonstrate the benefits of the actions we've taken. We're continuing to manage and evolve the company to further strengthen our competitive advantages, growing value through the transition, regardless of its pace. Turning now to some perspectives in 2021. As I said, we've made tremendous progress advancing our strategy over the past year. We remained focused on safety and reliability, delivering a second consecutive year of outstanding performance. In emission reductions, we expect to meet our 2025 reduction plans four years early. That led us to set even more aggressive plans for 2030. The experience we gained developing reduction roadmaps for our assets gives us confidence for what we can ultimately achieve. This helped form the basis of our recently announced ambition to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations by 2050. Of course, a big part of our work in this area involved our Low Carbon Solutions business. As I mentioned, this new business has made exceptional progress building a large inventory of new business opportunities with a focus on carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels. Importantly, we're also addressing emissions by providing high-performance products that deliver solutions to help our customers reduce their emissions. Demand for these products was very strong in 2021, enabling 7% growth in our performance product volumes. This helped drive record annual earnings in our Chemical business. Strengthening our portfolio across all of our businesses continues to be a key part of our strategic focus to increase shareholder returns. To that end, we had more exploration success in Guyana with six discoveries in 2021 and two additional discoveries already this year. This has expanded the estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek block to more than 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels and we're on schedule to start production this quarter at Liza Phase 2.  In the Permian, we continued to drive improvements in drilling and completions, increasing average production by nearly 100,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to approximately 460,000. We started up the Corpus Christi Chemical facility under budget and ahead of schedule. And we've continued to monetize non-core assets, generating more than $3 billion of cash proceeds from divestments during the year. Our actions are yielding strong results and, as I said, positioned us to benefit from demand recovery. We grew earnings to $23 billion and drove nearly $2 billion of structural efficiencies in 2021 on top of the $3 billion the year before. This puts us in a good position to significantly exceed our goal of $6 billion of structural cost savings per year by 2023 relative to 2019. We maintained our disciplined approach to investments, focused on competitively advantaged low cost of supply opportunities and on growing our portfolio of high-value products. CapEx was $16.6 billion for the year, which was near the low end of our guidance. As a result of our cost reductions, improved efficiency, and capital discipline, we've lowered our Brent breakeven price to $41 per barrel. We're continuing to drive that down even more, expecting to average $35 per barrel between now and 2027. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $48 billion, the highest since 2012. We used the available cash to restore our balance sheet, essentially paying back what we borrowed in 2020, reducing our debt-to-capital ratio to about 21%. As a result of our restored financial strength, we increased the annual dividend for the 39th consecutive year and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that started last month. Overall, a strong list of accomplishments. Now looking ahead to this year. Our plan is robust and progresses our strategic objectives. I'll highlight a few key items on this page. First, we will increase our competitively advantaged, low cost of supply production with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 in Guyana and the Coral LNG development in Mozambique. The same is true for the Permian, where our focus remains on driving further capital efficiency and high-value growth. We're already ramping up manufacturing at Corpus Christi and expecting to start up our Baton Rouge polypropylene expansion later this year. These projects will continue to grow production of our high-value chemical performance products. We're applying the same capabilities and expertise developed over decades to progress our net zero ambitions and grow our low carbon solutions business. In that business, we expect to reach final investment decisions on large-scale carbon capture and storage projects at La Barge, Wyoming, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We're continuing to advance the flagship carbon capture opportunity in Houston. It now has 14 participating companies and has potential to capture up to 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. We also anticipate beginning to lift renewable diesel from our agreement with Global Clean Energy's biorefinery in California later this year, as well as making a final investment decision on our renewable diesel project at our Strathcona refinery in Canada, expanding our lower emissions fuels offering. And finally, we expect to further strengthen our balance sheet and progress our share repurchase program while continuing to retain capital flexibility and optionality to adapt to market conditions and opportunities. Leveraging our core competitive advantages, we're well positioned for future success, irrespective of the path or pace. We have the flexibility to shift resources between our traditional and low-carbon businesses at any rate required. This provides a lot of optionality and positions us to lead industry in the energy transition and in earnings and cash flow growth. We thank you for joining us today and look forward to sharing more with you during our Investor Day on March 2. Unfortunately, because of ongoing COVID considerations, we'll conduct the events virtually again this year. We do look forward to the day when we can get back to hosting you all in-person. Before we take your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank Stephen for his leadership and significant contributions. As after 30 years of service, he will be retiring at the end of this month. I wish Stephen and his wife, Kim, the very best. You'll be missed. I'd also like to welcome Jennifer Driscoll, who will be joining later this month as our Vice President of Investor Relations. Yes. I'll take that, Phil. Good morning. As you know, one of the primary objectives we've had in looking at the portfolio is less about volume and volume targets and more about the quality and profitability of the barrels that we're producing. So, we've been aggressively trying to high-grade the portfolio across our businesses. And that's certainly true in the upstream, which led to the discussion we had a couple of years ago with respect to the divestment program, which continues to pay dividends and will continue to progress. And then the growth that we're seeing in Guyana and Permian and Brazil. And so I would expect that volumes are fairly consistent with what we've seen this year. And \u2013 but the mix within that volume profile will continue to improve and the earnings per barrel will continue to improve, and that's been the focus. And as we move forward, we'll continue \u2013 you'll continue to see the \u2013 what I'll say, the quality of the barrels or profitability of the barrels increase. And then with time, as you head out in the later years, you'll see volumes grow with that improved quality mix. You bet. Sure. Good morning, Biraj. So we talked some time ago about a $6 billion structural reduction through 2023. As we work through 2021, and drove additional improvements within the business, we've extended that restructural cost reduction. We expect, as I said this morning earlier, kind of around $2 billion again in 2022 and another $2 billion in 2023, so more than exceeding the level that we thought about and talked about last year. That obviously is the structural side of the equation in terms of reducing cost. The counterweight then is the inflation and Forex and some of the pressures that we're seeing. In the short-term, we were in the down cycle. We recognize that there would be a return and there would be growth, and that would put pressure on prices. And so we, in anticipation of that, tried to manage many of our contracts and the work that we are doing to maintain a level of cost and to minimize escalation as we headed into 2021 and into 2022, and that's paying off. We've managed to mitigate quite a bit of that inflation. Obviously, as time goes on, we'll start to see more of that. And our expectation is the businesses will work to offset that inflation growth. And longer-term, our objective is, as we grow the business with the investments that we're making in Chemical business, Chemical facilities and some of the changes that we're making in our downstream operations, and then as we grow some of the upstream businesses, we'll offset all that increased cost with structural efficiencies. Yes, sure. I think, again, what we're seeing in Papua New Guinea, and frankly, it's been replicated in other parts of the company is what we've been talking about, which is leveraging the full capabilities of the organization. One of the changes that we've made over time here is we brought a lot of the optimization skills and techniques that we've historically used in our downstream businesses, and our refineries where you're eking out pennies on the barrel to be successful. And taking that technology and approach to some of our upstream assets and sharing that technology and working with the upstream teams to improve the productivity of the assets on the ground, that's paying off really all around the world where we're applying that technique. And what you're seeing in Papua New Guinea is that's part of the driver \u2013 what the driver of that increase on top of just hard work by that operating team to maintain reliability and to run that plant to its constraints. And so I think it's the combination of those two things. And our expectation, we've seen that in Chemical as well. As we brought those plants up, we've been able to run above the nameplate capacity, just, again, with the optimization and the hard work of the operating team. So we've kind of have an expectation as we bring new assets on that those operating teams figure out unique ways to get beyond constraints and improve the performance. And maybe just a little bit of color commentary with respect to when we talk about performance, say, in the chemical company, what drives that and it's built on a pretty fundamental competitive advantage with respect to our technology capabilities and the work that we do with catalyst. And the developments that we've made give many of our chemical products unique characteristics, characteristics in use. So that's a really important part of the value equation. And then we have invested in the science and technology to work with customers on applications to take advantage of those unique properties. And we have labs in China and other places around the world to support our customers. And the value and use of that improved performance then is shared with customers and ourselves, which gives that uplift on our performance products. And I'd add Doug, that the high end of that range is consistent with what we're showing in 2021. Yes. And I would add, Doug, that the Board evaluates that quarterly. So it's an ongoing discussion. We don't have a fixed time period. It's a function of the things that Kathy talked about. Sure. And just to be clear on the chart that Kathy walked folks through the five, that we're showing on that bottom chart is dollars per barrel, it's not billions of dollars. So be clear on that. And so I think the heart of the reductions that you're seeing as we go forward is a function of capturing the best of what the corporation can bring to bear in each one of our businesses. Just a little bit of background, Devin. We started with process safety and basically, several years ago, launched an effort to take the best thinking that we had in each of our businesses, bring that together, come up with one approach to managing process safety and then roll that out across the organization. That has resulted in eliminating a lot of duplicate or programs running in parallel that brings cost. So we've saved with respect to the work that we are doing in that space. But much, much more importantly, we improved our results and have significantly reduced process safety events. And so we're continuing down that path. But it highlighted the strength of kind of capturing the learnings that have occurred across our different businesses over the decades. And the quality thinking that we have in each of our organizations and bringing those experts together and having them address the problem on a corporate-wide basis is delivering good results. We saw the same thing with reliability when we brought, again, the best thinking of the corporation across the different operating companies together to solve the challenge of how do we improve reliability structurally and sustainably across all of our businesses. This team came up with ideas and implementations that, once again, significantly lowered our cost, and is improving our performance. And so that is the kind of the recipe that we're executing across a very wide range of opportunities. We're bringing the maintenance activities and thinking about the above-site maintenance, how you \u2013 what are the price processes, how do you go about that into that same type of approach, leveraging the best of the corporation, which we expect to see significant improvements in our maintenance and turnaround spend. Technology and engineering that the new company or the new group that we're forming is basically, again, doing the same thing, best capabilities from each of our businesses. We have technology functions within each of our companies. We're bringing those things together, same with engineering. And we, again, expect to end up doing things much more cost efficiently for much more effect. And that \u2013 so the savings that we see going forward are really the result of a lot of different things being applied across a huge scale of our operations to significantly reduce cost. And there are other opportunities in the future. Think about supply chain, think about some of the financial transactions as we've, over the course of 2018 and 2019, realigned our businesses and work processes so that now, as you look across our different businesses, we're conducting businesses in a very similar back office approach, so to speak, that gives us an opportunity to capture the synergies that exist between those. So a really broad range of opportunities as we kind of open the doors between the different businesses across our corporation, take the best that each has to offer, bring those together and come up with an answer that's better than anyone on its own. And I think that, again, plays to this the competitive advantages that I've been talking about since taking this job around leveraging our scale, leveraging the integration of our businesses, leveraging the functional excellence that each of these companies have developed, how do we better take advantage of that, and then leveraging our technology and bringing that all together by leveraging the capabilities of our people. So that recipe is beginning to pay off. And frankly, hard to see where we \u2013 where that ends with respect to the improvements that we've got lined up for the business. I'll answer that, and then if Kathy has anything to add, I'll turn it over to her. But as we've talked about for quite some time, we do have an ongoing active M&A group that \u2013 but we look for things that \u2013 where we can and bring it into our portfolio add unique value, grow unique value. So it's got to be something that \u2013 where we feel like there's a synergy or a fit with what we're currently doing to lever that value up and see accretion very early on. And so that's how we're looking at that, and we look at it across all of our businesses for opportunities. And you've seen that kind of play out in the Chemical business here with an acquisition last year. You've seen it play out in our Downstream business. And so I think that's a very active program. But bottom line is, we've got to look at what that opportunity looks like in the context of what ExxonMobil can bring to bear, then make sure that we're in a position to effectively leverage our core competencies, skill sets and capabilities to grow value beyond what either one companies could do independently. And that's how we assess and think about that. Kathy, anything to add? Welcome. Well, I think \u2013 it's a great question, Sam. I think as we've talked about before, this is a really complicated space and it deals with a really important part of people's lives and the resiliency of the economies around the world. So I think I've been encouraged frankly by the growth in terms of the folks who are working in this space and actively thinking through how best to achieve and address what we've been talking about for some time to do a challenge. And I think there's a growing recognition and a growing acceptance of the need for a variety of solutions and approaches to strike that balance correctly and make sure that we make progress on lowering emissions. But at the same time, don't compromise the quality of people's lives. And I think what we're seeing play out today in Europe, certainly I think has made that point clear in terms of some of the challenges associated with moving quickly in this space or not thinking through all the potential downsides and unintended consequences. We've seen that here in the U.S. with some of the tightness of supply. And so that is the challenge. We are committed to helping society make that reduction. We are working hard to catalyze the right kind of policy to incentivize and to drive emissions down faster, while at the same time protecting people's standard of living and livelihoods. There are options to do that. It does require some policy in different places, and we're seeing some of that policy manifest itself in some of the countries around the world, which underpins the work that we're doing in low carbon solutions. And that's a global business with opportunities that we see developing all around the planet and many, many countries and there's policy in place today to support those investments, which is what's driving certainly in the early days. And then that, I think those policies and investments set good examples for other countries to consider and to think about in line with the needs of their constituencies. So I am encouraged. I do feel like there's a better conversation happening, obviously, a long ways to go there and lot of work to be done both from a policy standpoint as well as from the companies participating in the market. But you can imagine, if you think about looking across more in our global portfolio and then opportunities with customers or third parties is understanding what's the lowest cost of abatement? How much CO2 can you reduce for the lowest dollar spent? That group has a good perspective that we're leveraging across all the opportunities, whether they're internal or external. And frankly, if you look at the portfolio of opportunities that we're looking at as a company, there's a really good mix between what we're going to be doing at our own facilities, opportunities to provide lower emissions products for our customers and then opportunities to reduce industry-wide CO2 emissions. So it's got a good mix today. We're very early in this process. I mean, this is a very dynamic space. If you think back a couple of years ago, hydrogen and carbon capture and frankly, even biofuels were struggling to kind of be in the mix in terms of potential solutions. Whereas, today, I think people recognize the importance they're going to play going forward. And so I would just say it's rapidly evolving. There's a lot of interest. We've certainly had a lot of interest expressed in our business and the opportunities we're pursuing. So I would say, we'll keep talking about that. You'll see that business grow with time as places around the world take the steps to make the necessary reductions. I am glad to hear that. You too. Yes. Sure, Neil. I think maybe I'll start with where you ended, which is what we were talking about a couple of years ago, which you recall, we talked about, I think the terms I used where right now, the industry is playing a short game, and we're a long ball hitter. And how do you do \u2013 how do you take the long ball game into the unconventional space? And that led to the approach that Neil Chapman has talked about over the last couple of years with respect to setting up more of a manufacturing approach and driving efficiencies and driving technology applications into that \u2013 those developments. And that has worked very, very well. And we're seeing the results of that. So we grew our Permian production from 2020 to 2021 by over 25%. Our expectation as we go into 2022 is to grow another 25%, and that's doing that with a very tight control on capital. So that's how we're playing the game, and we continue to look at within our \u2013 the approach that we outlined a couple of years ago, and the success that we've seen with that and bringing to bear a lot of the technology and application expertise, I think drilling and reservoir management that the rest of the corporation has really seeing the benefits of that. We're going to make sure that we stay in that envelope. And obviously, as we progress production and development, new horizons are opening up, and we've got more delineation work to do that will continue to kind of grow the understanding of where the opportunities are. And we'll progress those in the context of staying within that concept that we've laid out, which we're seeing allows us to bring barrels to market at a very low cost. And that's going to be an important part of the equation, maintaining that low-cost, high-value operation. So this year, I think we're going to be 25% up. We expect to be 25% up from 2021, which is consistent with how \u2013 the increase that we saw from 2020 to 2021. Thank you. Okay. Yes. So I think a good observation, and I would echo the points you made, which is, if you look at our Chemical and Downstream business. Historically, they have been very well coordinated, I think, amongst the best within the industry. I would say, though, there's a difference between coordinating between two owners and then having a single owner. And \u2013 we really see the opportunity as \u2013 to have one set of management overlooking those businesses and making sure that we're prioritizing across those businesses and those resources, making sure that we're prioritizing not only the investments that we're making in the facilities, but the allocation of the resources, our technical resources, our engineering resources and pursuing the highest priority payout opportunities across those two. And it's difficult to do today across two separate organizations. This will improve upon that. So we've got a good base case. We think we're going to make this even better. And we've demonstrated the power of that to ourselves, frankly, in a couple of previous organizational changes. I'll just take the Upstream business, when you think about the functional companies that we had in our Upstream business, many of them, working very closely together and coordinating. We've then consolidated all those businesses from \u2013 from seven, three, two and now down to one. As we step through each of those, despite what I would say is the best intention of the organizations and working collaboratively together, you get a step change in performance and opportunity to reduce cost and becoming more efficient as you consolidate those. And so we're going to see, we believe, the same opportunity within the Downstream in the Chemical portfolio. The other point I would make, which I don't want to go unrecognized is by taking and centralizing what I will call a service delivery processes out of those businesses and, again, bringing the best corporation has to offer and then high grading the thinking there, as I talked about with process, safety and reliability, doing that in maintenance, we think is going to drive a step change improvement with respect to how we execute maintenance across the entire portfolio. So there's this opportunity to consolidate expertise and then leverage that across all of our operating companies. And so those two things, I think, are going to be very, very critical. And the third point I would make with respect to headcount reductions, that's not what we see driving this improvement opportunity. We made those tough decisions back in 2020. We recognized how hard that was going to be on the organization. And we stretched ourselves to make sure that when we put together our plans for that, we as best as possible, comprehended what was to come and made this a onetime deal as much as we can, and therefore stretch ourselves to then move the organization to the level of efficiency that we need to support a lower staffing. And that's the work that we've been doing. And then obviously, as attrition has occurred within our company and the industry more broadly and across the economy as a whole, we've been very thoughtful and cautious about what positions we fill and how we manage that attrition, again, continuing to think through opportunities to get more efficient and take advantage of the attrition to make sure that we're managing our staffing in line with what we see as the ultimate opportunity. When you put all that together, we feel like we're in a fairly good position to execute this and not have the kind of one-off large redundancy programs that we went through in 2020. Yes. And I would add, Paul, I don't think you have to go too far back in time to just test how resilient the strategy that we had in place with respect to capital structure was. I mean 2020, in the pandemic, and we saw the worst conditions in this industry in living memory. And the fact that we managed through that extreme set of circumstances, maintained our commitment to our shareholders, continued to pay dividend, managed our capital program and basically kept all those projects that we were pursuing alive and slowed some of those down, paused and kept others going, that balance that we struck going through those extreme challenging times. I think demonstrated the robustness of the approach that we are pursuing. Sure. Well, I think the story around natural gas is pretty well understood with respect to the tightness that we're seeing. And the majority of our sales of gas are contracted under long-term contracts. And \u2013 so limited opportunities to make significant changes in the short term. I would say that we do have a very active trading program, and we continue to grow that. And our expectation is that we'll continue to grow that. And so I think that's going to play a bigger role as we go forward. But I don't think as you look at today's results, it's \u2013 the value that you're seeing is basically being driven primarily by the base business. Yes. I would say there, nothing has changed per se. I think we have as, a fairly broad portfolio of opportunities that we've been working and we continue to work those. And if we can find \u2013 those projects, which deliver the kind of returns at the cost of supply that we think is needed to compete over a very broad range of future scenarios that we'll pursue those. That's kind of how we're thinking about it. And I would just say the work that we're doing in that space today is consistent with the work we've been doing for some time now. There are opportunities out there that we're evaluating, but they need to be competitive in the portfolio, and they need to be competitive long term across a very wide range of future scenarios. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Kathy Mikells",
            "content": "Sure. So look, our capital allocation priorities remain the same, right? First, let's make sure we're investing in the high-return assets and products across the business from Guyana to chemical performance products to biofuel. Second, really continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. I talked about on the third quarter, and we continue to look out to our term debt maturities with an eye to paying those down in 2022 and continuing to sustain the strong dividend that we have and then, obviously, returning further available cash to shareholders. We would have started the $10 billion share repurchase program at the beginning of the year, what I would have described as an equal pay against the 24-month longer-term time frame. As we assess both our year-end results, where we ended up in terms of net debt looking at the continued positive market environment, that would cause us to increase the pace of the share repurchase program. And as I stand here today, I'd say increasing the pace with the faster end of that 12- to 24-month pace in mind. We will continue to evaluate the program and the pace throughout the year. It's one thing to sit here today and sit in what are pretty favorable market conditions, but we'll just have to see how the year pans out. But that's how we're thinking about it right now. Sure. So overall, I think as you consider the range that we've given, I'd kind of point to starting the year with an expectation of being more towards the center of the range, and then we'll see, ultimately, how the projects and the big projects proceed is probably the biggest indicator and whether any new projects ultimately come online, which we would always be maintaining some level of flexibility for. Unsurprisingly, with the size of our Upstream business relative to Downstream and Chemicals, the biggest increase year-over-year comes from overall, the Upstream business and further spending in Guyana, further spending in unconventional, especially the Permian, beginning to up-weight our spending overall on our own emission reductions. And again, the Permian would be another place that we're particularly focused, restarting paused projects that we had in the Downstream and then you'll be well aware of the big projects that we have ongoing in Chemicals. So that's really what's driving the difference. And I'd say how we think about landing towards the middle versus a different end within that range. But obviously, tightening the range relative to the range that we've given over a longer period of time, which is the $20 billion to $25 billion. Yes. So I'd go back to the corporate plan disclosures we had where we talked about both within Chem and within Downstream, our focus on growing high-value, higher-margin projects, which would include low-emission fuels, and it would include high-performance lubricants in our lubricants portfolio as well as what we would describe as Chemical performance products and looking to double the volume of those products kind of over the planned period. And ultimately, as we look at the combination of Downstream and Chem over that period of time, looking to triple earnings and so it is a strong component of what sits behind tripling earnings, but I'd also say, and this comes through our breakeven analysis, continuing to reduce the structural costs within the business across all elements of the business also are a driver of that increased cash flow and earnings power. So that's how I would think about how we're looking to continue to upgrade the mix within both Downstream and Chemical. So you're probably asking questions that I'll dive into a bit more detail when we get to Investor Day, Doug, but you're right. What we walked through on this slide and specifically on the bottom of the slide, where we did the walk from our current breakeven to that average in $22 billion to $27 billion of $35 billion. What I would tell you is, as a result of the comment with regard to the portfolio improvement, continuing to take place over time. As you would expect, we start out at the higher end and then move to the lower end. So I would tell you our progress, while not exactly linear, continues to be fairly consistent over that period of time. And we'll definitely dive into that a bit further when we get to Investor Day. I guess; a, I'm not going to get out in front of the Board's decision with regard to further distributions to shareholders. We've talked previously as we've looked at our dividend that some of the metrics that we look at is both our dividend yield relative to our peers' dividend yield relative to, I'll call it, the total dividend yield on average on the market as well as looking at our payout ratio, our overall dividend size is larger than what our peers would be, and we have been more towards the top end of the range, both on yield as well as on payout ratio. Obviously, as we see the improved overall results at the company, that naturally is starting to impact both of those metrics, which we'll consider \u2013 continue to be considered as the Board looks to make decisions going forward. But I'd say, as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty good about what our dividend yield is and its competitiveness. The only other thing I'd add is in the low-carbon emission space, we're also actively assessing things, and we would have discussed the fact that we made an investment in BioJet, I'll call it a biodiesel company, that's out in Norway where we also have an off-take agreement. So we continue to look at opportunities in that space as well. So I'd say, right now, our focus is on building that third-party business, right? We have, I'd say, a huge number of projects in the pipeline. We feel very good about the progress that's been made in a pretty short period of time since we've launched the low carbon submission business, but we also have the overall activities in terms of reducing our own emissions. And those activities are really the prime accountability of the business lines. And so there's an overall, I'll call it, corporate coordination, best practice role that's taking place there. That's part of what enabled us to actually expect to meet the 2025 goals ahead of time. So when we talk about our overall efforts as it relates to emissions in their entirety, we're always talking about what we're doing within our own four walls and then what we're doing to help reduce, I'll call it, our customers' emissions, or more broadly, what the company does in terms of the products and technologies that it offers in helping to reduce society's emissions with lower life cycle emission type product. So that's how we think about it. And certainly, first and foremost, that third-party business is something we're focused on building today. So we are not expecting that, that's going to be, I'll call it, new segment that we're disclosing as opposed to just focusing on building that business, which is still in its early stages. Sure. So look, overall, the business composition, by its nature, is heavy Upstream relative to Downstream and Chem. So as you think about that mix, all of the businesses are contributing to the favorable mix. Upstream has an outsized contribution. We talked about in our strategic plan that 70% of those investments were in, I'll call it, the strategic Upstream development area, so Guyana, Permian, Brazil, bringing on more LNG, those are really what are fueling, I would call, the Upstream improvement in the portfolio. And then we also talked about, by the time we get to 2027 in Downstream and Chem over 40% of the earnings coming from those high-value, high-performance products. So you do get a mixture, overall, but obviously, a very big change overall in the portfolio coming from the Upstream. And, overall, that's what the big drivers are. We've talked about 50% of our volume from post-2020 start-ups in 2027 from the Upstream. So just to give you another stat, in terms of how significant the mix change is there. Okay. So overall, we would absolutely agree that during the best part of the cycle, we need to be really restoring our balance sheet and giving ourselves plenty of flexibility to contemplate what's ultimately going to be the down part of the cycle, which is difficult to call. You would have heard me make commentary that we are going to further reduce our debt. We certainly think getting to the low end of, I'll call it, the total debt to cap range is something that we're absolutely targeting and expecting to achieve this year. And relative to where we've been historically, I'd say carrying a bit more cash is within the expectation as well. So I would say we're very aligned in understanding that during the top part of the cycle, we really want to make sure that we've built in a whole lot of flexibility and completely restored our balance sheet, continue to have really strong credit ratings. We wouldn't, today, sit here and say, we think we need to have zero net debt or carry zero debt overall. And that does serve also as a little bit of an offset against inflationary pressure to some extent. So I'd say we feel pretty comfortable that we're getting the balance right in both ensuring we have a strong balance sheet and plenty of liquidity, and also then during this part of the cycle, making sure that we have a path forward to continue to have that flexibility and return excess cash within our capital allocation priorities to shareholders. And then I'll just come back to your second question. I'd say, as we look forward in the near term, just the next few years out, we don't really see our U.S. cash kind of tax position changing, but that is with a big caveat that there's obviously been a lot coming forward in Congress with respect to potential tax changes. And while the bill back better bill did not kind of ultimately go through, I also don't think it's entirely off the table in terms of coming back and seeing something smaller, but likely to still have various tax provisions in it. But that's how you should think about it for the moment before we see any other legislative changes. And no change with the big projects that we're progressing. Obviously, we've got the Mozambique Coral floating LNG projects, still expected start up towards the end of this year and continuing to progress the Golden Pass project."

Today's call is being recorded and at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kathryn Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  The full set of presentation slides, and prepare remarks were made available on the Investor Relations section of our website earlier this morning along with our press release. During our call this morning, Darren will provide a few additional opening comments, and reference a select number of slides from that presentation leaving more time for your questions. We expect to conclude the call at 9:30 AM Central Time. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2, and to the supplemental information at the end of the presentation slides on the website. I will now turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Stephen. Good morning. It's good to be with you today to discuss our strong third quarter results, and the progress we're making in growing shareholder value, and of course, to take your questions. I'd like to start by welcoming Kathy to the call, her first in what I know will be many. I can tell you that Kathy has hit the ground running, seamlessly joined the management team and has been broadly welcomed by the organization. While early in her tenure, we're already benefiting from her diverse experiences, and wise counsel.  Since we posted a full set of slides and remarks on the website, I'll keep my comments brief this morning. Starting with an overview of the work we're doing to position the Company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our first priority was to significantly grow the value of our base business to achieve industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth. This is work that has been ongoing for some time. And it's built on the significant the changes we have made to our organization and the increased focus on fully leveraging all of our competitive advantages, in technology, scale, integration, functional excellence, and most importantly, our people. It has also allowed us to improve operating performance, drive down cost, and develop a portfolio of industry advantaged high return investments. Our businesses are driving returns and generating cash to maintain a strong balance sheet and fund future investments.  The work we began in 2018 to develop opportunities in carbon capture and later low emission fuels, plays to our competitive strengths, positions us to build a successful low carbon solutions business, and take a leading role in driving to a lower carbon future in hard to decarbonize areas. At the same time, we have to ensure our plans are robust to a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways and the continuing use of hydrocarbons.  Our low carbon solutions business draws on the same core capabilities in competitive strengths used in our established businesses. This gives us optionality and builds resiliency into our plans. As the future takes shape and demand shift across our businesses, we will maintain our advantage.  Now, I will turn to our third quarter performance. The value of the organization\u2019s hard work I just highlighted is showing itself as the market recovers. In the third quarter, we delivered excellent operational and financial performance with improved earnings and cash flow.  We significantly improved our cash position, reduced total debt, progressed key projects, and set a number of best-ever operational milestones. Earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion. Year-to-date earnings surpassed $14 billion on the strength of our upstream portfolio and industry-leading chemical and downstream businesses. Last year during the pandemic, we worked to improve our cost structure by $3 billion versus 2019. That progress continued in the third quarter.  Our structural costs are now $4.5 billion lower than 2019 on an annual basis with a clear line of sight to continued improvements. Strong earnings and sound CapEx management resulted in cash flow after CapEx and dividends of $5.2 billion. We paid down approximately $4 billion of debt during the quarter and increased the dividend, maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth. Good progress and improving the earnings power of our business coupled with solid operating performance in a rapidly improving market, provides a good foundation for developing our future plans.  We will finalize our plans over the course of November and will provide additional details in early December. I would like to take the opportunity of this call to provide a brief overview of some key planned priorities and objectives. Starting with our operations. In 2020, we delivered industry-leading performance in safety and reliability. Our go-forward plans intend to sustain that leadership position. We also established objectives to significantly reduce emissions intensity by 2025. Our focus in this effort, more than paid off. We now expect to meet our objectives this year and are working to significantly raise the bar and reset our 2025 objectives.  We're also ahead of schedule on our work to improve our cost structure, we expect to deliver more than the $6 billion in structural savings by 2023. We continue to find additional synergies and greater efficiency throughout our new organization. We expect to keep our capital spend within the previously communicated range of $20 billion to $25 billion. This represents a significant reduction versus our pre-pandemic plans. Over the changes we've made to our businesses are new project organization, and improved use of technology.  We expect to deliver the same growth in earnings and cash flow as our pre-pandemic plans, offsetting the pandemic induced delays. In addition, we can free up funds to grow our low carbon solutions business and further accelerate efforts to reduce emissions. From 2022 to 2027, our cumulative capital investment in emission reduction projects is expected to be $15 billion. This year we made substantial progress in restoring the strength of our balance sheet. By year-end, we expect to be well within the debt-to-capital range of 20% to 25%.  On Wednesday, we announced an increase in our dividend, adding to what is already a very attractive yield. In addition, given the improvements in our business and market conditions, we are expanding shareholder distributions by up to $10 billion over 12 to 24 months, through repurchase program beginning next year. Our plans are being built from the bottoms-up, with strong line ownership and a commitment to deliver. They are flexible and can be adjusted to adverse market conditions.  They strike a strong balance across our capital allocation priorities, drive continued efficiencies and significantly grow earnings and cash flow while competitively positioning us for a wide range of future scenarios, including net 0 pathways. We look forward to sharing more details with you later this year and into the first quarter of next year. With that, I will now turn it back to Steven.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Darren. Operator, please open the phone lines for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Littleton, the Questions-and-Answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We request that you limit your questions to one initial with one follow-up, so that may take as many questions as possible. Your first question will come from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. And Ms. Wai your line may be on mute. Looks like she disconnected. We'll take our first question instead from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and welcome, Kathy, and looking forward to working with you over the next several years, hopefully. Darren, I want to kick off just by the comment on the -- commend your restraint against the ludicrous question you were faced with yesterday. I'm not sure all of it stood up to the same level of patience through that testimony. And that -- at least usually it's my first question, which is you're -- you've got a new Board, or at least a refresh Board and you've now come out with this updated low carbon gas investment strategy going forward.  I'm just curious when the new Board members have got to look under the hoods at the relative investment opportunities you have, the carbon intensity of those, the returns, the cash -- free cash margin expansion opportunities, and so on, I'm just curious how perceptions of the new Board members relative to what external perceptions might be, how those have evolved as you've had a chance to present your strategy to those folks.\nDarren Woods : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. I think maybe just start with maybe a little broader comment on the Board and the discussions we've been having, which I would tell you, it's -- we've got additional diversity of perspective in the Board. It's bringing a very engaged Board across the entire group, and a lot of good constructive discussions. And to your point, I think as folks come into the Company and look under the hood and get an understanding of how we approach and look at these businesses, the opportunities that we have and how our advantages manifest themselves in those opportunities. I think there's a generally, I'd describe it a sound solid consensus across the board in terms of the recognition of the strength of the portfolio that we have, and a recognition of the industry-leading position that our investment in our projects have.  I would also say, and as you know, we -- you mentioned low carbon investments. We launched that business earlier this year, but if you'll recall from our Investor day, I talked about that in the context of ventures that we established starting back in 2018, looking at carbon capture opportunities, and then a little later on the low emission fuels opportunities.  And what we're focused on there was, how do we find these investment opportunities to help drive lower emissions going forward, but do that in a way that's accretive to the shareholders, and one that distinguishes us from the rest of industry. And so, it's really looking for a formula that leverages our existing competitive advantages. And what we tried to share in the Investor Day last year and we'll continue to talk about and spend more time talking about at the Investor Day next year, is we think we have found a really good mix of opportunities that are very well aligned with our core capabilities.  And therefore, as we move forward, can invest in both our established businesses. Given some of the policy that exist around the world, there are opportunities to invest in a low carbon solutions business and still generate a very solid return from that. And then as we move and the growth manifests itself across that portfolio. Because we're drawing on those same capabilities, we have the ability to shift resources with -- between those and make sure that we're responding to the developments in the marketplace.  And that strategy, that discussion that we've been having with the Board, I think is recognized as a unique capability that this Company has. Our global footprint gives us exposure to a very broad set of markets and as those markets develop somewhat uniquely with respect to the transition, we can adjust our approach in those markets selectively to make sure that we're on the front end of that and taking advantage of the opportunities as they develop. So, I think there's a strong recognition of the advantages that we bring to this space as a whole.\nDoug Leggate : Well, thanks for that. [Indiscernible] the answer, Darren, I don't want this to be my follow-up. Just a clarification. The 15 billion is about 8%, I guess, consistent with I think the other US peers so we shouldn't expect a big strategic pivots here, aka some of the European models, is that fair?\nDarren Woods : I think that's right. And you know Doug it's -- this is -- I've been pleased with what I would say is a broader and growing recognition of the challenges of addressing this space and the number of solutions that are going to be needed. And in particular, a number of areas that we don't have complete solutions yet and the need for companies like ExxonMobil to help develop those.  So, we as you know, resisted what we think are some of the more, we call it commodity opportunities in this space and focused on where we don't have good solutions and where we can leverage a unique capability and therefore generate what we think will be unique returns. And that portfolio that we're talking about today, we're leveraging some proprietary technology to boost the returns there.  And so, our approach here is not going to be what I would call an industry standard, it's going to be advantaged projects like we've tried to generate in the rest of the portfolio. I think as you think about that 15 billion, part of it's around our growth projects and making sure that we are building resiliency into those growth projects by putting in the necessary investments in technology to lower the greenhouse gases. So those projects become that much more robust. And the returns that we're showing for those projects comprehend that spend to lower the emissions.  And then we've got new opportunities that we're pursuing that take advantage of some of the policy that are -- that's out there and generate returns. And then we're building and seeding what I would say the development of much larger scale projects that's going to require additional policy. And we're doing the work in anticipation of that, recognizing that as that policy front develops, we will be in a position to take advantage of that with projects that we've developed in anticipation of it.\nDoug Leggate : Thank you. My proper follow-up if I may, I'd like to ask Kathy a question if that's okay and also commend Stephen, for the prepared remarks put up in the slide deck, that's a terrific [illumination] (ph) for your disclosure. Thank you for that. Kathy, my question for you is, as an outsider so to speak coming in what do you see is the appropriate capital structure, dividend policy, dividend metrics like coverage and so on for a Company like ExxonMobil? How should we expect your stamp to be on that shareholder return dividend policy and so on going forward and obviously the buyback [and I assume is part of that as well] (ph)?\nKathy Mikells : To take a step back and say, how do we think about capital allocation for the business, Doug. And I would start with, first of all, we've got to invest in the advantaged projects that we have that on very strong returns and that's from Guyana to things like bio-fuels and the Strathcona project. Obviously, we've been very focused on maintaining a strong dividend. I think the Company did a great job as it went through the pandemic, really protecting that dividend and that's a priority for us.  And with that, I have a strong balance sheet, and you've seen our focus over the course of this year in strengthening the balance sheet. In this quarter, we reduced debt by about $4 billion. After we consider those priorities, if we've got available cash, we will then look to distribute that to shareholders and you've obviously seen that in the buyback announcement that we had.  I think it's important also to just recognize that the Company looks to have a balanced approach and maintain flexibility, would have seen the Company reduce its capital expending pretty significantly, in part to protect the dividend as the pandemic was ensuing. And so, we do have flexibility as we think about capital allocation, but those are our priorities. Obviously, share repurchase programs are an efficient way to distribute capital to shareholders, but that's how we think about it.\nDoug Leggate : Welcome again and thanks for taking my questions.\nKathy Mikells : Thank you.\nDarren Woods : Thanks Doug.\nOperator: All right. We'll go back to Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting me back in the queue. Apparently, I don't know how to operate my work phone anymore after maternity leave, so thank you.\nStephen Littleton : Good morning.\nJeanine Wai : Good morning. Maybe just following up on Doug's question, but asking it in a little different way, can you just talk about how the new Board is weighing evidence that increased oil and gas investment is probably warranted, not just from Exxon, but globally against what's becoming essentially a mandate from investors to allocate capital to the energy transition, and how does that seemingly dual mandate square with the current medium-term CapEx range? We know you reiterated it, but we understand that the low carbon solution and emission reductions that will now have a larger share and that CapEx spend is extending beyond the medium-term range.\nDarren Woods : I'll start off with that and then if Kathy 's got anything to add on I'll pass it onto her. You talked about a dual mandate and that's really the challenge that we face as a Company. And I think more broadly as a society which is clearly a drive to move to a lower emissions energy system and a lower emissions future. But at the same time recognizing that the need for energy today is real and continuing to grow.  And I think striking that balance and thoughtfully moving forward and trying to make sure that as you're transitioning from one source to another, that you do in a way that it doesn't penalize populations and compromise people's standards of living. You see a little maybe evidence of the challenge there when you look at what's happening in Europe and some of the constraints as we've come out of the pandemic to depletion business and the lack of investment that the industry broadly had in 2019 going into -- severely into 2020 and still coming out of that in 2021.  And then the growth in demand, you put those two together lack of demand, lower supply growing lack of -- lower supply and lower investments and then the growth in demand, you get these pinch points. And so, I think the Board and management were very conscientious of that and recognize our challenge is to leverage our perspective, the experience that we have in this space, our understanding of it and to try to strike the appropriate balance and make sure we're moving forward at a pace, in fact, leading industry as we drive to the slower emissions future, but not leave whole communities behind and penalize them with respect to their standards of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. And the investments that we're making, I think strike that balance.  I've been very pleased that the work that we started back in 2018, 2019, and all -- and through 2020. difficult to see during the pandemic with the collapse in the demand. But I think today as we come out of that and you see the market recovery, the benefits of those structural changes that we have made are manifesting themselves. We're able to generate the same kind of value with a lot less capital in a lot less expense and that's been because of the work we've done with our organization and the emphasis on leveraging our competitive advantages and foremost among those, our people and the work that they've done through this timeframe and the technology that we've brought to bear in some of this work.  We -- if you look at the capital portfolio that we had coming into the pandemic, none of the projects -- we haven't dropped any of the projects. We're still moving those forward. As you know, we paused them. But if you look at the spend associated with those projects, we've actually managed to bring that spend down.  And I think that's a testament to our new project\u2019s organization. A lot of good work manifesting itself in the results that you're seeing and in the future that we're laying out, the ability to do what we said we were going to do more efficiently, and then expand into the lower carbon area, where we're finding with the work that we've done opportunities in that space as well.\nJeanine Wai : Hey, great. Thank you. And then I guess my second question -- our second question is on the share repurchases. So, for the repurchases over the next 12 to 24 months, how did you decide on the up to $10 billion level and the 2-year time frame, and I guess we're just curious about what conditions will determine the pace and the ultimate amounts?\nKathy Mikells : Sure. Overall, we decided the amount in the pacing looking out at our future plans and what our expectations were against the capital allocation priorities that I walked through earlier relative to the free cash flow that we're expecting we're going to generate. Now, obviously market conditions have a lot to do with exactly what that's going to turn out to be, hence the range that we provided and the range in timing that we provided. But I think you should start off thinking about that as rateables over that two-year range that we discussed. And then we'll assess market conditions in terms of adjusting the pace of the program over time.\nJeanine Wai : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will be from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh : Hey, good morning. I want to get your thoughts on asset sales first. As the slides highlight, you're making some progress in certain opportunities there. In the past, you've talked about a broader $15 billion program pre - COVID. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about asset sales as part of your portfolio optimization or streamlining over the long term and does the $15 billion-plan still hold as we look out these next few years?\nDarren Woods : Good morning, Phil. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I would tell you the work that we did prior in announcing that divestment was really around high grading the portfolio, and what we laid out was what we thought was the opportunity. That portfolio set in terms of the assets that we're looking at hasn't changed from the standpoint of anything coming out.  In fact, what I would say is we continue to evaluate where we can better leverage our competitive strengths and high-grade that portfolio, I think you'd see the opportunity set that underpins that divestment portfolio growth. And then of course, our ability to execute those opportunities and high graded the asset portfolio will be a function of, obviously finding buyers who put a value on that, that's consistent with what we think we need in order to take that out of the portfolio. So that's work going on.  I would tell you; we did a lot of work last year maintaining our push in this space, but not willing to really push anything out to a market where we didn't see the value that we expected to get. I think as the markets now recover, much more attractive market to sell into, and we're seeing the kind of buyer response and valuations that we think are more consistent with what we're looking for. So, my view is we'll see continued progress in that space and I would expect it to pick up here compared to certainly 2020 when the market was much more challenging.\nPhil Gresh : Got it. And if I could ask just one more question on the buybacks, the strength in chemicals right now, the improving downstream environment, it would seem like you should be able to cover your dividend at about $50 Brent, looking at 2022, even if CapEx were higher in that $20 to $25 billion range. And if I were to layer in $5 billion of buybacks, that'd be about $10 in the oil price.  So, it would seem like the ratable plan could be covered at maybe $60 Brent and obviously prices are higher than that. I'm just curious if you think that math is reasonable and if it is right that maybe excess cash could still go to either more buybacks or towards more Balance Sheet deleveraging and just how you think about those. Thank you.\nDarren Woods : Again, I'll start off and then if Kathy has got anything to add, invite her to chip in there. I would say your break-even calculations are significantly higher than what ours are. And of course, one of the issues is we haven't had the opportunity to take you through the plan that's in development and the reviews that we're having with our board. That's I think to come, but the work that we've been doing and what I've referenced here so far on the call with respect to the OpEx reductions that we're seeing in the opportunity frankly that we see going forward, and the capital productivity that we're now demonstrating.  And I'd put that really in two buckets. 1, is the project organization which I continually refer back to, but to me it's been such a huge success to leverage what were very strong organizations across the corporation, centralizing that, bringing it together, and making sure that we're putting the best resources in the target -- on the projects that best fit the need. Their capabilities are really resulting in some significant capital efficiency improvements. And the other thing -- the other bucket would be technology.  We laid out a plan -- I'll just focus on the Permian for now, but we laid out a plan there to pre-invest, to do a lot of delineation to understand what we had there. We were working on bringing in some technology, doing quite a bit of trialing and testing, which again required some upfront capital. We put in an -- if you recall what I call the long ball game, which is leveraging ExxonMobil 's strengths into a Permian and move from what was I considered a short game and the Permian to a long ball and that's paying off and we're seeing that work that we're doing out in the Permian deliver the same value for a lot less spend.  And that's a function of that organization and the work that they've been doing to really drive their efficiencies, but also to fully leverage the capability of the broader ExxonMobil corporation and our technology portfolio. So that's how I'd say we're going to be able to do everything we've talked about. And frankly, depending on how the market is. As you know, it's really hard to call the market and we built some plans with some pretty wide ranges and we're robust to some very low-price environments going forward that won't compromise the capital allocation balance that we've talked about. And if we find the market is higher than that low side, we will have additional cash and resources to work on and give that challenge to Kathy, but maybe let her talk about that for a minute.\nKathy Mikells : Just one other thing that I'd address which you referenced and that's continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We clearly intend to do that. And so, at the end of this quarter, our leverage ratio landed at I think technically 25.3. And we've talked about the fact that as we look at the fourth quarter, we expect to move into a more comfortable zone within that range and further reduce that in the fourth quarter.  As we look out to next year, we do have debt coming due, which we would expect to retire, and so I would expect to see a bit of a further reduction in debt moving towards the lower end of that range over time. Again, we're looking to strike the right balance and, on the share, repurchase side, what the commodity cycle looks like as we enter 2022, is going to have a lot in determining what the rate and pace of the share repurchase program looks like.\nPhil Gresh : I appreciate the additional thoughts. Thanks.\nDarren Woods : Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Devin Mc Dermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin Mc Dermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nDarren Woods : Good morning, Devin.\nDevin Mc Dermott : Hey. So, the first one I wanted to ask on is just on some of the cost and efficiency trends. You've done a really good job executing on some of the structural savings that you talked about previously and the latest message is now to exceed the $6 billion target by 2023. I was wondering if in light of that you comment on whether or not you're seeing any inflationary trends across the portfolio, be it through labor, inflation, service cost inflation, and the extent you are some of the ability to offset that as we look into 2022 and beyond.\nDarren Woods : Sure. I would tell you I don't think we're immune to the pressures that are impacting just about every other business out there all around the world. And so, we certainly seeing some aspects of that in our business if I start with the big spend area with respect to our capital in projects. think somewhat, maybe counter-intuitively, the fact that we were working on those going into the pandemic and we went into the pandemic, I think we took somewhat of a longsighted approach with respect.  We didn't just step out of those projects, instead we worked with our partners and contractors to think about how we put these projects on pause and then bring them back up in a thoughtful way as and when the market would enable that. And so, the work that we did last year and working with our partners allowed us to give them some certainty around work and opportunities going forward.  And we were able to lock in some of the market factors at that point in time. In the capital space, I think we've done a pretty good job and will be pretty well positioned to offset a lot of those -- or not experience a lot of those inflationary pressures. In the base business certainly the higher price of energy is impacting our manufacturing.  We're advantaged in that space generally because most of our facilities are more energy efficient than our competitors and so while that's raising cost across the board with that advantage, we're able to stay below where the rest is. And of course, market prices move in these commodity markets based on the marginal cost for the suppliers but the last barrel supply. So that's we're able -- I think that's being offset with the margins.  And then, I'd say more generally, what's left with respect to supply chain and inflationary pressures with the organizations that we have in place, and them up and running now, and then a much richer environment with higher margins and more activity. They are able to take the efficiencies and the synergies that we've captured with new organization and the different approaches that we're now taking and apply that in a more, let me call it, target-rich environment.  So, we're able to find those efficiencies and offset a lot of inflation. So, the different aspects happening in different parts of the business. But generally, that inflationary pressure, we're managing to basically cope with it and still deliver on the earnings growth that we set for ourselves, the target we set for ourselves.\nDevin Mc Dermott : Great. Very helpful. And my second question is on the Permian. Very strong results in the quarter, a pretty sizable increase in the production expectation for this year, as well. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the trends you're seeing there from an operational improvement in capital efficiency standpoint, knowing that you did some of the pre -investment that you mentioned before, that's helping on the efficiency side here and then also the cadence that's kind of spend in activity as we look into 2022.\nDarren Woods : Sure. Well, as you know, we had this contiguous acreage that we recognize would be advantaged with respect to trying to develop what would be -- I'll call it a more manufacturing approach in the Permian. You'll recall we made some upfront investments around, 1 delineating that acreage to make sure we knew what we had, because I think as Neil's talked in the past about, not all of that acreage is the same.  The reservoirs are different as you move around that -- the area up there, and so making sure that we were thinking -- focusing on the areas where we had the highest productivity. But at the same time making sure that any area that we approach, that we optimized everything in the subsurface and weren't going for just high initial rates, but instead looking at maximum recovery. And that's paid off.  We invested in the corridors, we invested in the infrastructure to make sure that we are in a position to once we focused in on and identified the areas, we wanted to develop that we could do that in a very cost-efficient way and that is now paying off. As you look at what we're doing in the Permian, it is much more of a manufacturing mindset and very focused on efficiencies. And you're seeing that in the results and some of the metrics that are out there.  And then the third area is, and it continues to, I think yield benefits is, thinking about how we bring our fundamental science and technology capabilities from the broader organization, from some -- from our corporate research group and bring that into play here in the Permian and then the unconventional space. And that is paying off as well, we've gotten I think some very positive results from some of our technologies that we've brought into the field. We're continuing to try our new technology.  So, my expectation is we'll continue to see that manifest itself in better production and better capital efficiency and that's those would be the three pieces of the equation that I think are resulting in the performance that you're seeing. With respect to the overall activity, what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what I just talked about and not as we maximize what we can do within that space, making sure we don't get ahead of the technology work that we're doing and making sure we don't get outside those core doors and some of those optimized areas of production.  And that's the balance and the debate that we're striking. And we may see a couple more rigs come on here as we go forward in staying within that same philosophy. I wouldn't see us starting to venture out into other areas that are outside, that optimize space and plan until we've done the work to optimize plans around that next tier of opportunities out there.\nDevin Mc Dermott : Great. Well, congrats on the great results. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Next, we got Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you.\nDarren Woods : Morning Sam.\nSam Margolin : First question is on, back to the capital program and I recognize that we're in front of the board process and things are still being hammered out, but I think the way that the market is conceptualizing the range is that the spend for the underlying asset base today, including the growth projects is probably tighter than the range that you've communicated and the top end of the range is sort of a rainy day fund for a special opportunities that arise either in the low carbon sphere or otherwise.  Do you think that's a fair assessment as we think about 2022? And I think it flows into an earlier point about breakeven as well. How do we think about the outflow on CapEx within the range which obviously influences that commodity price break-even assessment?\nKathy Mikells : Sure. Obviously, this year, our capital spending has been purposefully constrained and we think we're going to come in, I'd say at the lower end of that $16 billion to $19 billion range we've provided. We are expecting higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and a significant increase as we head into 2022. What underpins that is further investments in Guyana, focused on Auraiya (ph) Yellowtail appraisals, [Indiscernible] in Brazil is now moving into the startup of drilling and so more significant spending heading into there.  We obviously paused a number of downstream and chemical projects. Those are restarting, and so we'll start to see that spend in the fourth quarter and kick up pretty significantly into 2022. And I'd also mention that as we will look to accelerate our reductions in greenhouse gas, emissions and intensities specifically will be spending a bit more in that area. If you think about how that is going to cause us to kick up, I'd say that clearly will put us in that 20 to 25 billion range, and then clearly, we would leave ourselves some level of flexibility in that range for things that we can't fully anticipate as we sit here today.\nSam Margolin : Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on carbon capture. The Reconciliation Bill is in the process now, there have been a few different drafts that have come out each with seems like distinct kind of carbon capture language and incentives in them. As you think about ExxonMobil 's plan and proposition in that asset class, how are the early returns that you've seen in these draft bills and do you think they're sufficient to drive a real acceleration in activity for you there?\nDarren Woods : Well, the way I would look at it, Sam, I think trying to predict what's coming out of that political process is, I don't know if it's as hard or harder than trying to predict where prices are going to go. So maybe just spend a little time talking about the philosophy that we've taken with respect to developing the low carbon business and again, I would start with foundationally the work that we're doing has to leverage some advantage.  We want to make sure that the investments that we're making here, we bring some unique value to and expect that unique value than manifest itself. In value for our shareholders. And so that's the foundation and I mentioned this carbon capture venture that we started back in 2018 in the low emission fuels and was how do we take advantage of the portfolio of technologies that we have and the skills and capabilities of our people to find ways to do this that are different and better than the rest of industry. So that's the foundation.  Then as a philosophy, making sure that we develop a portfolio that is accretive with existing policy. So not betting on the comp, not thinking that something is going to pop here and then developing projects that ultimately disappoint us. And so that -- and given that we've got a really broad footprint, we're able to tap into different policies around the world. And there are a number of governments since we launched low carbon solutions that have reached out to us, and want to work with us to understand how we can -- what we can bring to the equation to help advance some of their objectives.  And so those discussions are happening, but I would say there's a fundamental layer of investment that is accretive with existing policy. Don't look -- don't need more help. Then there's the other tier where [Indiscernible] certainly would not be regret investments, but we would need to see some additional policy tests to make those -- to give us the returns that we would expect given the resources we're bringing to bear with -- for those projects.  And those are another we need to develop those now, because if we wait until the policies in place, will be behind the game. And so, we're being very thoughtful around developing those projects. It also informs what we're going to need, and so that we can very clearly articulate the policymakers all around the world, what would be required, and it starts this down what I would call that learning curve to better inform policymakers and then position us to respond to the policy as and when it comes.  Because I think one thing is very clear, in order for society to achieve this longer-term ambition, we're going to need different policies, additional policies around the world. We want to be helped to lead the industry, and the drive to lower emissions and then to take advantage and influence some of those policies.\nSam Margolin : Thank you very much.\nDarren Woods : Sure.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read : Good morning.\nDarren Woods : Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read : Just wanted to probably a little bit follow-up and the questioning that Phil was doing earlier as we think about the 2025 goal of roughly $30 billion in earnings, we take this quarter and annualize it, not realize that's and just playing what math more than trying to force you into a corner, but you'd be at about $27 billion, and yes, prices are higher on the commodity front versus the $60 real, but what I wanted to understand as we look at the cash OpEx reduction that's pretty identifiable, then you have the portfolio.  And growth component. Where would you say you are on the portfolio and growth component today? And how should we think about that, maybe stair-stepping in over the next couple of years again against the sort of $60 real environment.\nDarren Woods : Let me just start in terms of how we think about that and make sure that we're holding ourselves in the organization to a standard that doesn't require market helps. So, the comment that we're making with respect to doubling the earnings and cash flow potential of the business. We try to normalize for price environment.  So, we're not going to take any help from the market or assumed up from the market, but instead, assume constant price basis and make sure that the work that we're doing, our structural improvements, and so that if the markets there -- inconsistent, then we'll double it, if it's higher, we'll do even more than that, and if it's lower, we'll still be in a very robust position. And so that's how we think about it in this year's -- certainly this quarter's margins are not consistent with the basis that we're using for longer term.  We are getting some advantage from the market today. We don't assume that it's something that manifest itself through the plan. And so that's I think an important foundation to evaluate the comments that were making. Talked about a structure efficiency that's obviously huge part. And as I said, when we get through the plan, get that endorsed, and when we come out, start speaking and take you through their Investor Day, we'll spend more time explaining where some of those savings are coming from. That'll be a really important contributing factor.  And then with respect to the projects in the businesses, I think as you look across each of those, the projects are delivering what we expected. In fact, in many cases, delivering more than we had anticipated for the things that we started off. I'll give you just a couple of examples, if you look at investments that we've already made in the Gulf Coast and our chemical plants, those are running well above the AR basis, reliability and throughput much higher than we expected. So that's delivering more value.  You look at the Rotterdam hydrocracker out in Europe, and that was a new-to-the-world technology, upgrading very low value streams into high value lubricant products that is performing very, very well and delivering well above the basis. And so -- and if you look at our chemicals business and the high-performance products, a lot of the growth and value that we see in that business comes from continuing to penetrate the market with these differentiated high value products and the chemical organizations doing a great job at continuing to grow that and to demonstrate the value of those technical benefits to our customers so that they in turn can realize some benefit from those products.  Those are all working very well. And finally, in the downstream. a lot of work to make sure that we are driving efficiencies into that business and then squeezing, upgrading every molecule we can into the higher value segments, the projects that we've talked about in that space are doing just that, just high grading the molecules and getting more value, and when you combine that with reduced cost, refine business is better positioned, and of course the lubricants business, again, a differentiated high-value, technology-driven products.  They are really doing very, very well, growing their business. And this year we're seeing record earnings in there. So can you look at across one of the advantages of having such a diverse portfolio is it gives us a lot of strength and levers to pull, to grow value. And so, you see that and all of them. And then of course, the final point I would make is and I've been making throughout this call is we're able to deliver those a lot of those projects in those benefits at a much lower cost, a lot less capital. And so that's playing into the benefits that we've laid out in the deck.\nRoger Read : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then follow-up question. LNG markets have gone -- they've been really strong I guess, let's say, Global Gas. We know that over the last couple of years there seem to be some hesitancy from consumer side on signing term contracts. You're -- you've got some projects obviously, that are potentially ready to go and some others that are in process. And I was just wondering, any clarity you can offer in terms of changing customer behavior, or willingness to sign term contracts in the LNG market right now?\nDarren Woods : No, I think certainly, if anything, what I would suggest is that some of the challenges that they're seeing in the global gas market just reinforces the importance of secure sources of supply and the reliable source of supply. And so, I don't -- we haven't seen what I would say is any material shifts in terms of how the market and the consumers in those markets are looking at the opportunities in this space.\nKathy Mikells : Yeah. And our portfolio is heavily weighted to long-term contracts. About 80%, so we'd expect that to continue to be the case.\nRoger Read : Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Next, we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : Good morning, team. Darren have you -- guys have a unique perspective into the state of global oil and liquids demand given your large downstream footprint, will love your perspective of where you see us real-time in the demand recovery, how you see the path forward and then how that ties into whether we're going to see refining margins back to mid-cycle or above in 2022.\nDarren Woods : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Neil. So, what I would say is we are definitely seeing around the world a recovery with respect to economic activities and of course with that comes the recovery in energy demand. I would say that it stops and starts so to speak, as you move around the world with some of the variance that we're seeing with COVID slow things down and then pick back up again. But generally, as you look around the world, seeing recovery, if you look across what I would say the primary transportation. fuels.  Let's say road transport, commercial transport, heavy-duty transport, those are getting back to where they were historically. And so, I would say the recovery -- you can clearly see that recovery is in place. The thing that's lagging, which I'm sure we all recognize given our own personal circumstances is air travel is lagging of that recovery. It is improving, continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We saw an improvement this quarter.  And so, I think ultimately when you see that demand balance recover and when I say demand balance, I mean across a barrel of crude as it moves into the transportation markets. It's going to require air travel to get back to where it was. And then it'll just be a function about how strong that economic growth is that drives that -- the activity and then the demand.  And that will of course be balanced with the amount of capacity that is available to meet that demand. So as always, supply and demand balance will be the primary factor. There's been a lot of refinery closure, in a lot higher rate than there has been. These high energy prices through gas and LNG are going to put some additional pressure on some of the less advantaged refineries.  So, I think we got to see how that plays out, but our view is, this -- the downstream business, when it has a peak or goes through a tight supply demand balance, it doesn't last very long. So, we're really gearing that business up to be successful and at very low margin environment. And we're leveraging and focusing our efforts on refineries that are integrated with our chemicals business and integrated with our lubricants business so that we aren't dependent and reliant upon just the fuels market, but instead have a much more diversified product slate that taps into some of the higher value products.\nKathy Mikells : And then I'd just comment as we look at industry utilization it's kind of approaching, I'll call it the lower-end of what the 10-year range would look like. So as Jack recovers here slowly over time, that should give us some further opportunity for improvement.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks team. The follow-up is on the clean energy announcement today. The $15 billion of capital, how should we think about the returns associated with that, and is there a target that you have in mind? I go back to one of your competitors inventory transition day where they said $10 billion of capital and maybe a billion dollars of cash flow in the out-years. Do you anticipate providing a quantification of cash flow associated with those $15 billion of investments, and how do you think about the hurdle rates in terms of those investments? And a tie into that, as you think about bio-fuels versus hydrogen, versus carbon capture, is there anything that really stands out as having outsized economic return at this point?\nKathy Mikells : Sure. So [Indiscernible], I would start with by taking a step back and saying, we expect double-digit returns across all of our business and we don't look at this business really any differently. If I look specifically at the capital that I'd say is targeted towards the low carbon solutions business so different from the emissions reductions that we're making across our own portfolio, either our existing business or the growth projects and looking to offset those incremental emissions that would come with growth projects.  What I'd say is we look at that and say we think we can see really strong double-digit returns coming from there. Now, we have a lot of biofuel projects that are embedded there, which are supported by current policy. There's Takona project up in Canada would be a great example of that. Clearly, we are seeing some investments. Darren referenced the Houston Hub project where we have to seed those investments today. Carbon capture doesn't need fuller policy support. We referenced that earlier in the discussion today.  But if we don't start to see the planning for those investments, we will be behind when the policy support comes. And it's clear if we're going to make more progress towards a lower carbon future, more policies support does have to come. That is how we're thinking about it, and we see great opportunities in the space that we're targeting where we think the Company really brings advantage. Carbon capture, hydrogen, biofuels is our current focus, and we think we're going to be able to prosecute those projects and earn good returns.\nDarren Woods : And I would add to that, Neil. If you think -- just take biofuels, as Kathy mentioned, Strepto interproject. And that's not what I would say is an industry standard biofuels project. We're leveraging our process, technology -- our catalyst technology to try change the value proposition there. And that's true with what we're looking at in hydrogen. And obviously we've got some work that we're doing and carbon capture.  So, in all those areas, it's coming back to -- and the challenge, given the organization, the standard we're holding ourselves to, we've got to find a way to do this, meet this demand as this need of a lower-carbon, lower emissions future, but doing it in a way that's advantaged and therefore brings value to shareholders. And that we're not letting go there, we're making sure that the organization understands we're going to do both. Not an or equation.\nNeil Mehta : Very clear. Thank you, guys.\nStephen Littleton : So, Operator, Darren, and Kathy we probably have time for one more question.\nDarren Woods : Okay.\nOperator: Okay. So, we will take our last question from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning.\nDarren Woods : Good morning Paul.\nPaul Cheng : Two questions please. Good morning. First is for four Cap rate and that maybe let me add my welcome to the end of the line. You are the first person from outside joined the Company management committee. And also, with that quite frankly, for the past, say, 30 year, ExxonMobil haven't official CFO grow. So, half that you jaw enough that you have been there for several months.  How you think about the process in the What's your O and M as well as the criteria, Do you see that's room for change or adjustment or that you think the current process is pretty good and you don't really have any changes that need to be made? So that's the first question. For the second question, Darren, when we are looking at your CapEx has always been for at least that for the past 18 months at 20, 25 billion for the next several years. You maintain that, but your spending for the low top and is going to be increased by [Indiscernible] roughly $2 billion a year from previously may maybe 5, $600 million to say 2.5 billion now.  If the incremental spending is all being absorbed because you doing better in other business. And be able to squeeze or this savings or that some NCA SI (ph) project has been pushed out, if they are, what are those and what does the low top in business say you targeting I think is 10% plus return. Is that going to be better than the project that you have pushed out and what we voted said is Mosambi (ph) is noticeable missing in your press release when you're talking about the strategic investment, can you give an update on that? Thank you.\nKathy Mikells : Hey. Well, I will start in and I guess the first thing that I would say is, I've been really pleased with how the organization has actually welcomed me. You can imagine coming into a Company like ExxonMobil. I would say I was a little bit anxious about what the receptivity would be, and both at the management committee, I'd say across the senior leadership team and across the Company, people have just been really welcoming, which has been terrific.  The other thing I would say is as I look at many of the companies\u2019 processes, I'm really pleased by how rigorous and thorough they are. ExxonMobil puts a lot of work behind things before it comes out and then makes decisions and talks about those things. And so, you mentioned our FID process, which I think is incredibly rigorous.  And the Company added sometime back a process that they call red blue team, which is literally putting really smart people and competing them against each other to say, hey, as we're going to FID this project, tell us what a different perspective is, and whether the project could be even better than what our base economics are, and tell us what a different perspective might be in terms of what some of the call it hidden risks might be in the project, and have we evaluated all of that?  And that's the process where I'd say we take all of those learning's and then the base economics, how we're managing the risks of the projects, just get improved to an even greater level. So, I'd say I've been really pleased just by the thorough work that's done across the Company. And I'd take that even into a different area we haven't talked about it on the call, but obviously net zero is the topic of the day and the Company is clearly doing a lot of work in terms of its own scenario analysis.  We talked a lot about the announcement we made in increasing our investment in the low carbon emission space and again, all I would comment on is that the rigor of the work that you see at the Company is incredible. The work that we're doing on a site by site, location by location basis in staring at our cost curves and the plans and how we're going to reduce our own carbon footprint. I just think it is incredibly thorough and detailed and it's what enables us to really stand strongly behind our plan. So anyway, I've been really pleased and I'm really happy with just how the organization has accepted me as an outsider.\nDarren Woods : I will just add, Paul, I think it doesn't feel like Kathy is an outsider quite frankly, I mean, she has come in and joined the team and I'm not sure that anybody on the management committee thinks of her any different than the rest of us, so it's been I think a really nice fit, and she brings in a different perspective which is very valued and it's added to the discussions and the debates that we've been having and we're going to continue to have.  With respect to the questions that you've asked me, I didn't quite catch the last one, but I'll address your first around the incremental spending and how given we haven't changed the range, but it feels a little bit like the portfolio mix is changing. How do we -- where did that come from? How do we think about that?  And so, what I would tell you is probably 3 components of how with our evolving plans and the work that we're doing in particularly the additional spend in low - carbon solutions, how we're doing that within the same band of the range of capital that we've projected or given all of you. Savings is clearly one of them and I've mentioned that quite a bit throughout the call, so I won't go back around that again, but that has made a difference, the ability -- you remember what we said we wanted to do was double earnings and double cash flow, and that's been the objective.  It hasn't been a volumes game, it hasn't been our capital spend game is around how do you do that and do it in most effectively, and as we've found ways to do it more effectively, that's allowed us to take off some of the capital spending. That's an important component of it. There are -- there have been some shifting as there always is in this space and so if you think about some of the LNG projects there has been some movement on that Mozambique and the work that we've been doing there and the collaboration with Total with some of the issues that we've seen in Mozambique.  That has slipped some, but we're still committed to that project. We see that as a valuable opportunity, but we're going to have to do that in the time frame available to us with some of the constraints that we see today. So, there is some movement in some of those projects. Obviously, we delayed the downstream and chemical projects. Those are coming back up again, but that shifted the pattern a little bit, so there's some of that in there.  And then the third bucket I would say is we always left ourselves some headroom, and that headroom is -- continues in there. We've got flexibility. We never -- there's always -- I think the question out there about where we had 20 and where we had 25. I'd say we're somewhere around there and it moves from year-to-year, and we give ourselves a little bit of space, recognizing that things are going to move around very difficult to predict some of the scheduling movement around there. That's how I would think about it, those three buckets.  And frankly, the way we judge that is ultimately does that movement inhibit our ability to deliver on the value proposition that we laid out. And that was -- is one of the points that why we really want to emphasize that we are going to deliver on the earnings and cash flow growth, which is what we have been driving the organization to do because we believe ultimately that underpins growing TSR total shareholder return. And the last point, Kathy you have --\nKathy Mikells : I think you already touched a little bit upon what I thought was your last Paul, and that was about Mozambique. And our core project is clearly moving forward and you touched upon the project that we pause simply because of the security situation on the ground, which we'll continue to look at and revisit overtime.\nPaul Cheng : Still -- you guys are still committed to that because I think there's some market rumors that Exxon may be [Indiscernible] whatever you want to get -- to be in that projects.\nDarren Woods : Yeah, I wouldn't put a lot of faith in the market rumors that you guys know, Paul, there is a lot of people talking. Most of them don't have a good understanding of the discussions that we're having and how -- we see that as a very competitive resource. It's large. We've got opportunities with Totale that we've been working on. They're committed to the project. We got really good working relationship with them as well as our other partners and our existing but I think we'll continue to develop that. We think that's going to be very competitive in the long term and something that's going to be needed so that we're committed -- we continue to be committed to them.\nPaul Cheng : Thank you.\nStephen Littleton : Okay. Darren and Kathy, we want to thank you for joining us and for all on the call. Thanks for your time and above all questions this morning, we hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you and please be safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephen. Good morning. It's good to be with you today to discuss our strong third quarter results, and the progress we're making in growing shareholder value, and of course, to take your questions. I'd like to start by welcoming Kathy to the call, her first in what I know will be many. I can tell you that Kathy has hit the ground running, seamlessly joined the management team and has been broadly welcomed by the organization. While early in her tenure, we're already benefiting from her diverse experiences, and wise counsel.  Since we posted a full set of slides and remarks on the website, I'll keep my comments brief this morning. Starting with an overview of the work we're doing to position the Company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our first priority was to significantly grow the value of our base business to achieve industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth. This is work that has been ongoing for some time. And it's built on the significant the changes we have made to our organization and the increased focus on fully leveraging all of our competitive advantages, in technology, scale, integration, functional excellence, and most importantly, our people. It has also allowed us to improve operating performance, drive down cost, and develop a portfolio of industry advantaged high return investments. Our businesses are driving returns and generating cash to maintain a strong balance sheet and fund future investments.  The work we began in 2018 to develop opportunities in carbon capture and later low emission fuels, plays to our competitive strengths, positions us to build a successful low carbon solutions business, and take a leading role in driving to a lower carbon future in hard to decarbonize areas. At the same time, we have to ensure our plans are robust to a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways and the continuing use of hydrocarbons.  Our low carbon solutions business draws on the same core capabilities in competitive strengths used in our established businesses. This gives us optionality and builds resiliency into our plans. As the future takes shape and demand shift across our businesses, we will maintain our advantage.  Now, I will turn to our third quarter performance. The value of the organization's hard work I just highlighted is showing itself as the market recovers. In the third quarter, we delivered excellent operational and financial performance with improved earnings and cash flow.  We significantly improved our cash position, reduced total debt, progressed key projects, and set a number of best-ever operational milestones. Earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion. Year-to-date earnings surpassed $14 billion on the strength of our upstream portfolio and industry-leading chemical and downstream businesses. Last year during the pandemic, we worked to improve our cost structure by $3 billion versus 2019. That progress continued in the third quarter.  Our structural costs are now $4.5 billion lower than 2019 on an annual basis with a clear line of sight to continued improvements. Strong earnings and sound CapEx management resulted in cash flow after CapEx and dividends of $5.2 billion. We paid down approximately $4 billion of debt during the quarter and increased the dividend, maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth. Good progress and improving the earnings power of our business coupled with solid operating performance in a rapidly improving market, provides a good foundation for developing our future plans.  We will finalize our plans over the course of November and will provide additional details in early December. I would like to take the opportunity of this call to provide a brief overview of some key planned priorities and objectives. Starting with our operations. In 2020, we delivered industry-leading performance in safety and reliability. Our go-forward plans intend to sustain that leadership position. We also established objectives to significantly reduce emissions intensity by 2025. Our focus in this effort, more than paid off. We now expect to meet our objectives this year and are working to significantly raise the bar and reset our 2025 objectives.  We're also ahead of schedule on our work to improve our cost structure, we expect to deliver more than the $6 billion in structural savings by 2023. We continue to find additional synergies and greater efficiency throughout our new organization. We expect to keep our capital spend within the previously communicated range of $20 billion to $25 billion. This represents a significant reduction versus our pre-pandemic plans. Over the changes we've made to our businesses are new project organization, and improved use of technology.  We expect to deliver the same growth in earnings and cash flow as our pre-pandemic plans, offsetting the pandemic induced delays. In addition, we can free up funds to grow our low carbon solutions business and further accelerate efforts to reduce emissions. From 2022 to 2027, our cumulative capital investment in emission reduction projects is expected to be $15 billion. This year we made substantial progress in restoring the strength of our balance sheet. By year-end, we expect to be well within the debt-to-capital range of 20% to 25%.  On Wednesday, we announced an increase in our dividend, adding to what is already a very attractive yield. In addition, given the improvements in our business and market conditions, we are expanding shareholder distributions by up to $10 billion over 12 to 24 months, through repurchase program beginning next year. Our plans are being built from the bottoms-up, with strong line ownership and a commitment to deliver. They are flexible and can be adjusted to adverse market conditions.  They strike a strong balance across our capital allocation priorities, drive continued efficiencies and significantly grow earnings and cash flow while competitively positioning us for a wide range of future scenarios, including net 0 pathways. We look forward to sharing more details with you later this year and into the first quarter of next year. With that, I will now turn it back to Steven. Thank you, Doug, and good morning. I think maybe just start with maybe a little broader comment on the Board and the discussions we've been having, which I would tell you, it's -- we've got additional diversity of perspective in the Board. It's bringing a very engaged Board across the entire group, and a lot of good constructive discussions. And to your point, I think as folks come into the Company and look under the hood and get an understanding of how we approach and look at these businesses, the opportunities that we have and how our advantages manifest themselves in those opportunities. I think there's a generally, I'd describe it a sound solid consensus across the board in terms of the recognition of the strength of the portfolio that we have, and a recognition of the industry-leading position that our investment in our projects have.  I would also say, and as you know, we -- you mentioned low carbon investments. We launched that business earlier this year, but if you'll recall from our Investor day, I talked about that in the context of ventures that we established starting back in 2018, looking at carbon capture opportunities, and then a little later on the low emission fuels opportunities.  And what we're focused on there was, how do we find these investment opportunities to help drive lower emissions going forward, but do that in a way that's accretive to the shareholders, and one that distinguishes us from the rest of industry. And so, it's really looking for a formula that leverages our existing competitive advantages. And what we tried to share in the Investor Day last year and we'll continue to talk about and spend more time talking about at the Investor Day next year, is we think we have found a really good mix of opportunities that are very well aligned with our core capabilities.  And therefore, as we move forward, can invest in both our established businesses. Given some of the policy that exist around the world, there are opportunities to invest in a low carbon solutions business and still generate a very solid return from that. And then as we move and the growth manifests itself across that portfolio. Because we're drawing on those same capabilities, we have the ability to shift resources with -- between those and make sure that we're responding to the developments in the marketplace.  And that strategy, that discussion that we've been having with the Board, I think is recognized as a unique capability that this Company has. Our global footprint gives us exposure to a very broad set of markets and as those markets develop somewhat uniquely with respect to the transition, we can adjust our approach in those markets selectively to make sure that we're on the front end of that and taking advantage of the opportunities as they develop. So, I think there's a strong recognition of the advantages that we bring to this space as a whole. I think that's right. And you know Doug it's -- this is -- I've been pleased with what I would say is a broader and growing recognition of the challenges of addressing this space and the number of solutions that are going to be needed. And in particular, a number of areas that we don't have complete solutions yet and the need for companies like ExxonMobil to help develop those.  So, we as you know, resisted what we think are some of the more, we call it commodity opportunities in this space and focused on where we don't have good solutions and where we can leverage a unique capability and therefore generate what we think will be unique returns. And that portfolio that we're talking about today, we're leveraging some proprietary technology to boost the returns there.  And so, our approach here is not going to be what I would call an industry standard, it's going to be advantaged projects like we've tried to generate in the rest of the portfolio. I think as you think about that 15 billion, part of it's around our growth projects and making sure that we are building resiliency into those growth projects by putting in the necessary investments in technology to lower the greenhouse gases. So those projects become that much more robust. And the returns that we're showing for those projects comprehend that spend to lower the emissions.  And then we've got new opportunities that we're pursuing that take advantage of some of the policy that are -- that's out there and generate returns. And then we're building and seeding what I would say the development of much larger scale projects that's going to require additional policy. And we're doing the work in anticipation of that, recognizing that as that policy front develops, we will be in a position to take advantage of that with projects that we've developed in anticipation of it. Thanks Doug. I'll start off with that and then if Kathy 's got anything to add on I'll pass it onto her. You talked about a dual mandate and that's really the challenge that we face as a Company. And I think more broadly as a society which is clearly a drive to move to a lower emissions energy system and a lower emissions future. But at the same time recognizing that the need for energy today is real and continuing to grow.  And I think striking that balance and thoughtfully moving forward and trying to make sure that as you're transitioning from one source to another, that you do in a way that it doesn't penalize populations and compromise people's standards of living. You see a little maybe evidence of the challenge there when you look at what's happening in Europe and some of the constraints as we've come out of the pandemic to depletion business and the lack of investment that the industry broadly had in 2019 going into -- severely into 2020 and still coming out of that in 2021.  And then the growth in demand, you put those two together lack of demand, lower supply growing lack of -- lower supply and lower investments and then the growth in demand, you get these pinch points. And so, I think the Board and management were very conscientious of that and recognize our challenge is to leverage our perspective, the experience that we have in this space, our understanding of it and to try to strike the appropriate balance and make sure we're moving forward at a pace, in fact, leading industry as we drive to the slower emissions future, but not leave whole communities behind and penalize them with respect to their standards of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. And the investments that we're making, I think strike that balance.  I've been very pleased that the work that we started back in 2018, 2019, and all -- and through 2020. difficult to see during the pandemic with the collapse in the demand. But I think today as we come out of that and you see the market recovery, the benefits of those structural changes that we have made are manifesting themselves. We're able to generate the same kind of value with a lot less capital in a lot less expense and that's been because of the work we've done with our organization and the emphasis on leveraging our competitive advantages and foremost among those, our people and the work that they've done through this timeframe and the technology that we've brought to bear in some of this work.  We -- if you look at the capital portfolio that we had coming into the pandemic, none of the projects -- we haven't dropped any of the projects. We're still moving those forward. As you know, we paused them. But if you look at the spend associated with those projects, we've actually managed to bring that spend down.  And I think that's a testament to our new project's organization. A lot of good work manifesting itself in the results that you're seeing and in the future that we're laying out, the ability to do what we said we were going to do more efficiently, and then expand into the lower carbon area, where we're finding with the work that we've done opportunities in that space as well. Good morning, Phil. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I would tell you the work that we did prior in announcing that divestment was really around high grading the portfolio, and what we laid out was what we thought was the opportunity. That portfolio set in terms of the assets that we're looking at hasn't changed from the standpoint of anything coming out.  In fact, what I would say is we continue to evaluate where we can better leverage our competitive strengths and high-grade that portfolio, I think you'd see the opportunity set that underpins that divestment portfolio growth. And then of course, our ability to execute those opportunities and high graded the asset portfolio will be a function of, obviously finding buyers who put a value on that, that's consistent with what we think we need in order to take that out of the portfolio. So that's work going on.  I would tell you; we did a lot of work last year maintaining our push in this space, but not willing to really push anything out to a market where we didn't see the value that we expected to get. I think as the markets now recover, much more attractive market to sell into, and we're seeing the kind of buyer response and valuations that we think are more consistent with what we're looking for. So, my view is we'll see continued progress in that space and I would expect it to pick up here compared to certainly 2020 when the market was much more challenging. Again, I'll start off and then if Kathy has got anything to add, invite her to chip in there. I would say your break-even calculations are significantly higher than what ours are. And of course, one of the issues is we haven't had the opportunity to take you through the plan that's in development and the reviews that we're having with our board. That's I think to come, but the work that we've been doing and what I've referenced here so far on the call with respect to the OpEx reductions that we're seeing in the opportunity frankly that we see going forward, and the capital productivity that we're now demonstrating.  And I'd put that really in two buckets. 1, is the project organization which I continually refer back to, but to me it's been such a huge success to leverage what were very strong organizations across the corporation, centralizing that, bringing it together, and making sure that we're putting the best resources in the target -- on the projects that best fit the need. Their capabilities are really resulting in some significant capital efficiency improvements. And the other thing -- the other bucket would be technology.  We laid out a plan -- I'll just focus on the Permian for now, but we laid out a plan there to pre-invest, to do a lot of delineation to understand what we had there. We were working on bringing in some technology, doing quite a bit of trialing and testing, which again required some upfront capital. We put in an -- if you recall what I call the long ball game, which is leveraging ExxonMobil 's strengths into a Permian and move from what was I considered a short game and the Permian to a long ball and that's paying off and we're seeing that work that we're doing out in the Permian deliver the same value for a lot less spend.  And that's a function of that organization and the work that they've been doing to really drive their efficiencies, but also to fully leverage the capability of the broader ExxonMobil corporation and our technology portfolio. So that's how I'd say we're going to be able to do everything we've talked about. And frankly, depending on how the market is. As you know, it's really hard to call the market and we built some plans with some pretty wide ranges and we're robust to some very low-price environments going forward that won't compromise the capital allocation balance that we've talked about. And if we find the market is higher than that low side, we will have additional cash and resources to work on and give that challenge to Kathy, but maybe let her talk about that for a minute. Thanks, Phil. Good morning, Devin. Sure. I would tell you I don't think we're immune to the pressures that are impacting just about every other business out there all around the world. And so, we certainly seeing some aspects of that in our business if I start with the big spend area with respect to our capital in projects. think somewhat, maybe counter-intuitively, the fact that we were working on those going into the pandemic and we went into the pandemic, I think we took somewhat of a longsighted approach with respect.  We didn't just step out of those projects, instead we worked with our partners and contractors to think about how we put these projects on pause and then bring them back up in a thoughtful way as and when the market would enable that. And so, the work that we did last year and working with our partners allowed us to give them some certainty around work and opportunities going forward.  And we were able to lock in some of the market factors at that point in time. In the capital space, I think we've done a pretty good job and will be pretty well positioned to offset a lot of those -- or not experience a lot of those inflationary pressures. In the base business certainly the higher price of energy is impacting our manufacturing.  We're advantaged in that space generally because most of our facilities are more energy efficient than our competitors and so while that's raising cost across the board with that advantage, we're able to stay below where the rest is. And of course, market prices move in these commodity markets based on the marginal cost for the suppliers but the last barrel supply. So that's we're able -- I think that's being offset with the margins.  And then, I'd say more generally, what's left with respect to supply chain and inflationary pressures with the organizations that we have in place, and them up and running now, and then a much richer environment with higher margins and more activity. They are able to take the efficiencies and the synergies that we've captured with new organization and the different approaches that we're now taking and apply that in a more, let me call it, target-rich environment.  So, we're able to find those efficiencies and offset a lot of inflation. So, the different aspects happening in different parts of the business. But generally, that inflationary pressure, we're managing to basically cope with it and still deliver on the earnings growth that we set for ourselves, the target we set for ourselves. Sure. Well, as you know, we had this contiguous acreage that we recognize would be advantaged with respect to trying to develop what would be -- I'll call it a more manufacturing approach in the Permian. You'll recall we made some upfront investments around, 1 delineating that acreage to make sure we knew what we had, because I think as Neil's talked in the past about, not all of that acreage is the same.  The reservoirs are different as you move around that -- the area up there, and so making sure that we were thinking -- focusing on the areas where we had the highest productivity. But at the same time making sure that any area that we approach, that we optimized everything in the subsurface and weren't going for just high initial rates, but instead looking at maximum recovery. And that's paid off.  We invested in the corridors, we invested in the infrastructure to make sure that we are in a position to once we focused in on and identified the areas, we wanted to develop that we could do that in a very cost-efficient way and that is now paying off. As you look at what we're doing in the Permian, it is much more of a manufacturing mindset and very focused on efficiencies. And you're seeing that in the results and some of the metrics that are out there.  And then the third area is, and it continues to, I think yield benefits is, thinking about how we bring our fundamental science and technology capabilities from the broader organization, from some -- from our corporate research group and bring that into play here in the Permian and then the unconventional space. And that is paying off as well, we've gotten I think some very positive results from some of our technologies that we've brought into the field. We're continuing to try our new technology.  So, my expectation is we'll continue to see that manifest itself in better production and better capital efficiency and that's those would be the three pieces of the equation that I think are resulting in the performance that you're seeing. With respect to the overall activity, what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what I just talked about and not as we maximize what we can do within that space, making sure we don't get ahead of the technology work that we're doing and making sure we don't get outside those core doors and some of those optimized areas of production.  And that's the balance and the debate that we're striking. And we may see a couple more rigs come on here as we go forward in staying within that same philosophy. I wouldn't see us starting to venture out into other areas that are outside, that optimize space and plan until we've done the work to optimize plans around that next tier of opportunities out there. Morning Sam. Well, the way I would look at it, Sam, I think trying to predict what's coming out of that political process is, I don't know if it's as hard or harder than trying to predict where prices are going to go. So maybe just spend a little time talking about the philosophy that we've taken with respect to developing the low carbon business and again, I would start with foundationally the work that we're doing has to leverage some advantage.  We want to make sure that the investments that we're making here, we bring some unique value to and expect that unique value than manifest itself. In value for our shareholders. And so that's the foundation and I mentioned this carbon capture venture that we started back in 2018 in the low emission fuels and was how do we take advantage of the portfolio of technologies that we have and the skills and capabilities of our people to find ways to do this that are different and better than the rest of industry. So that's the foundation.  Then as a philosophy, making sure that we develop a portfolio that is accretive with existing policy. So not betting on the comp, not thinking that something is going to pop here and then developing projects that ultimately disappoint us. And so that -- and given that we've got a really broad footprint, we're able to tap into different policies around the world. And there are a number of governments since we launched low carbon solutions that have reached out to us, and want to work with us to understand how we can -- what we can bring to the equation to help advance some of their objectives.  And so those discussions are happening, but I would say there's a fundamental layer of investment that is accretive with existing policy. Don't look -- don't need more help. Then there's the other tier where [Indiscernible] certainly would not be regret investments, but we would need to see some additional policy tests to make those -- to give us the returns that we would expect given the resources we're bringing to bear with -- for those projects.  And those are another we need to develop those now, because if we wait until the policies in place, will be behind the game. And so, we're being very thoughtful around developing those projects. It also informs what we're going to need, and so that we can very clearly articulate the policymakers all around the world, what would be required, and it starts this down what I would call that learning curve to better inform policymakers and then position us to respond to the policy as and when it comes.  Because I think one thing is very clear, in order for society to achieve this longer-term ambition, we're going to need different policies, additional policies around the world. We want to be helped to lead the industry, and the drive to lower emissions and then to take advantage and influence some of those policies. Sure. Good morning, Roger. Let me just start in terms of how we think about that and make sure that we're holding ourselves in the organization to a standard that doesn't require market helps. So, the comment that we're making with respect to doubling the earnings and cash flow potential of the business. We try to normalize for price environment.  So, we're not going to take any help from the market or assumed up from the market, but instead, assume constant price basis and make sure that the work that we're doing, our structural improvements, and so that if the markets there -- inconsistent, then we'll double it, if it's higher, we'll do even more than that, and if it's lower, we'll still be in a very robust position. And so that's how we think about it in this year's -- certainly this quarter's margins are not consistent with the basis that we're using for longer term.  We are getting some advantage from the market today. We don't assume that it's something that manifest itself through the plan. And so that's I think an important foundation to evaluate the comments that were making. Talked about a structure efficiency that's obviously huge part. And as I said, when we get through the plan, get that endorsed, and when we come out, start speaking and take you through their Investor Day, we'll spend more time explaining where some of those savings are coming from. That'll be a really important contributing factor.  And then with respect to the projects in the businesses, I think as you look across each of those, the projects are delivering what we expected. In fact, in many cases, delivering more than we had anticipated for the things that we started off. I'll give you just a couple of examples, if you look at investments that we've already made in the Gulf Coast and our chemical plants, those are running well above the AR basis, reliability and throughput much higher than we expected. So that's delivering more value.  You look at the Rotterdam hydrocracker out in Europe, and that was a new-to-the-world technology, upgrading very low value streams into high value lubricant products that is performing very, very well and delivering well above the basis. And so -- and if you look at our chemicals business and the high-performance products, a lot of the growth and value that we see in that business comes from continuing to penetrate the market with these differentiated high value products and the chemical organizations doing a great job at continuing to grow that and to demonstrate the value of those technical benefits to our customers so that they in turn can realize some benefit from those products.  Those are all working very well. And finally, in the downstream. a lot of work to make sure that we are driving efficiencies into that business and then squeezing, upgrading every molecule we can into the higher value segments, the projects that we've talked about in that space are doing just that, just high grading the molecules and getting more value, and when you combine that with reduced cost, refine business is better positioned, and of course the lubricants business, again, a differentiated high-value, technology-driven products.  They are really doing very, very well, growing their business. And this year we're seeing record earnings in there. So can you look at across one of the advantages of having such a diverse portfolio is it gives us a lot of strength and levers to pull, to grow value. And so, you see that and all of them. And then of course, the final point I would make is and I've been making throughout this call is we're able to deliver those a lot of those projects in those benefits at a much lower cost, a lot less capital. And so that's playing into the benefits that we've laid out in the deck. No, I think certainly, if anything, what I would suggest is that some of the challenges that they're seeing in the global gas market just reinforces the importance of secure sources of supply and the reliable source of supply. And so, I don't -- we haven't seen what I would say is any material shifts in terms of how the market and the consumers in those markets are looking at the opportunities in this space. Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Neil. So, what I would say is we are definitely seeing around the world a recovery with respect to economic activities and of course with that comes the recovery in energy demand. I would say that it stops and starts so to speak, as you move around the world with some of the variance that we're seeing with COVID slow things down and then pick back up again. But generally, as you look around the world, seeing recovery, if you look across what I would say the primary transportation. fuels.  Let's say road transport, commercial transport, heavy-duty transport, those are getting back to where they were historically. And so, I would say the recovery -- you can clearly see that recovery is in place. The thing that's lagging, which I'm sure we all recognize given our own personal circumstances is air travel is lagging of that recovery. It is improving, continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We saw an improvement this quarter.  And so, I think ultimately when you see that demand balance recover and when I say demand balance, I mean across a barrel of crude as it moves into the transportation markets. It's going to require air travel to get back to where it was. And then it'll just be a function about how strong that economic growth is that drives that -- the activity and then the demand.  And that will of course be balanced with the amount of capacity that is available to meet that demand. So as always, supply and demand balance will be the primary factor. There's been a lot of refinery closure, in a lot higher rate than there has been. These high energy prices through gas and LNG are going to put some additional pressure on some of the less advantaged refineries.  So, I think we got to see how that plays out, but our view is, this -- the downstream business, when it has a peak or goes through a tight supply demand balance, it doesn't last very long. So, we're really gearing that business up to be successful and at very low margin environment. And we're leveraging and focusing our efforts on refineries that are integrated with our chemicals business and integrated with our lubricants business so that we aren't dependent and reliant upon just the fuels market, but instead have a much more diversified product slate that taps into some of the higher value products. And I would add to that, Neil. If you think -- just take biofuels, as Kathy mentioned, Strepto interproject. And that's not what I would say is an industry standard biofuels project. We're leveraging our process, technology -- our catalyst technology to try change the value proposition there. And that's true with what we're looking at in hydrogen. And obviously we've got some work that we're doing and carbon capture.  So, in all those areas, it's coming back to -- and the challenge, given the organization, the standard we're holding ourselves to, we've got to find a way to do this, meet this demand as this need of a lower-carbon, lower emissions future, but doing it in a way that's advantaged and therefore brings value to shareholders. And that we're not letting go there, we're making sure that the organization understands we're going to do both. Not an or equation. Okay. Good morning Paul. I will just add, Paul, I think it doesn't feel like Kathy is an outsider quite frankly, I mean, she has come in and joined the team and I'm not sure that anybody on the management committee thinks of her any different than the rest of us, so it's been I think a really nice fit, and she brings in a different perspective which is very valued and it's added to the discussions and the debates that we've been having and we're going to continue to have.  With respect to the questions that you've asked me, I didn't quite catch the last one, but I'll address your first around the incremental spending and how given we haven't changed the range, but it feels a little bit like the portfolio mix is changing. How do we -- where did that come from? How do we think about that?  And so, what I would tell you is probably 3 components of how with our evolving plans and the work that we're doing in particularly the additional spend in low - carbon solutions, how we're doing that within the same band of the range of capital that we've projected or given all of you. Savings is clearly one of them and I've mentioned that quite a bit throughout the call, so I won't go back around that again, but that has made a difference, the ability -- you remember what we said we wanted to do was double earnings and double cash flow, and that's been the objective.  It hasn't been a volumes game, it hasn't been our capital spend game is around how do you do that and do it in most effectively, and as we've found ways to do it more effectively, that's allowed us to take off some of the capital spending. That's an important component of it. There are -- there have been some shifting as there always is in this space and so if you think about some of the LNG projects there has been some movement on that Mozambique and the work that we've been doing there and the collaboration with Total with some of the issues that we've seen in Mozambique.  That has slipped some, but we're still committed to that project. We see that as a valuable opportunity, but we're going to have to do that in the time frame available to us with some of the constraints that we see today. So, there is some movement in some of those projects. Obviously, we delayed the downstream and chemical projects. Those are coming back up again, but that shifted the pattern a little bit, so there's some of that in there.  And then the third bucket I would say is we always left ourselves some headroom, and that headroom is -- continues in there. We've got flexibility. We never -- there's always -- I think the question out there about where we had 20 and where we had 25. I'd say we're somewhere around there and it moves from year-to-year, and we give ourselves a little bit of space, recognizing that things are going to move around very difficult to predict some of the scheduling movement around there. That's how I would think about it, those three buckets.  And frankly, the way we judge that is ultimately does that movement inhibit our ability to deliver on the value proposition that we laid out. And that was -- is one of the points that why we really want to emphasize that we are going to deliver on the earnings and cash flow growth, which is what we have been driving the organization to do because we believe ultimately that underpins growing TSR total shareholder return. And the last point, Kathy you have -- Yeah, I wouldn't put a lot of faith in the market rumors that you guys know, Paul, there is a lot of people talking. Most of them don't have a good understanding of the discussions that we're having and how -- we see that as a very competitive resource. It's large. We've got opportunities with Totale that we've been working on. They're committed to the project. We got really good working relationship with them as well as our other partners and our existing but I think we'll continue to develop that. We think that's going to be very competitive in the long term and something that's going to be needed so that we're committed -- we continue to be committed to them."

            "name": "Kathy Mikells",
            "content": "To take a step back and say, how do we think about capital allocation for the business, Doug. And I would start with, first of all, we've got to invest in the advantaged projects that we have that on very strong returns and that's from Guyana to things like bio-fuels and the Strathcona project. Obviously, we've been very focused on maintaining a strong dividend. I think the Company did a great job as it went through the pandemic, really protecting that dividend and that's a priority for us.  And with that, I have a strong balance sheet, and you've seen our focus over the course of this year in strengthening the balance sheet. In this quarter, we reduced debt by about $4 billion. After we consider those priorities, if we've got available cash, we will then look to distribute that to shareholders and you've obviously seen that in the buyback announcement that we had.  I think it's important also to just recognize that the Company looks to have a balanced approach and maintain flexibility, would have seen the Company reduce its capital expending pretty significantly, in part to protect the dividend as the pandemic was ensuing. And so, we do have flexibility as we think about capital allocation, but those are our priorities. Obviously, share repurchase programs are an efficient way to distribute capital to shareholders, but that's how we think about it. Thank you. Sure. Overall, we decided the amount in the pacing looking out at our future plans and what our expectations were against the capital allocation priorities that I walked through earlier relative to the free cash flow that we're expecting we're going to generate. Now, obviously market conditions have a lot to do with exactly what that's going to turn out to be, hence the range that we provided and the range in timing that we provided. But I think you should start off thinking about that as rateables over that two-year range that we discussed. And then we'll assess market conditions in terms of adjusting the pace of the program over time. Just one other thing that I'd address which you referenced and that's continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We clearly intend to do that. And so, at the end of this quarter, our leverage ratio landed at I think technically 25.3. And we've talked about the fact that as we look at the fourth quarter, we expect to move into a more comfortable zone within that range and further reduce that in the fourth quarter.  As we look out to next year, we do have debt coming due, which we would expect to retire, and so I would expect to see a bit of a further reduction in debt moving towards the lower end of that range over time. Again, we're looking to strike the right balance and, on the share, repurchase side, what the commodity cycle looks like as we enter 2022, is going to have a lot in determining what the rate and pace of the share repurchase program looks like. Sure. Obviously, this year, our capital spending has been purposefully constrained and we think we're going to come in, I'd say at the lower end of that $16 billion to $19 billion range we've provided. We are expecting higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and a significant increase as we head into 2022. What underpins that is further investments in Guyana, focused on Auraiya (ph) Yellowtail appraisals, [Indiscernible] in Brazil is now moving into the startup of drilling and so more significant spending heading into there.  We obviously paused a number of downstream and chemical projects. Those are restarting, and so we'll start to see that spend in the fourth quarter and kick up pretty significantly into 2022. And I'd also mention that as we will look to accelerate our reductions in greenhouse gas, emissions and intensities specifically will be spending a bit more in that area. If you think about how that is going to cause us to kick up, I'd say that clearly will put us in that 20 to 25 billion range, and then clearly, we would leave ourselves some level of flexibility in that range for things that we can't fully anticipate as we sit here today. Yeah. And our portfolio is heavily weighted to long-term contracts. About 80%, so we'd expect that to continue to be the case. And then I'd just comment as we look at industry utilization it's kind of approaching, I'll call it the lower-end of what the 10-year range would look like. So as Jack recovers here slowly over time, that should give us some further opportunity for improvement. Sure. So [Indiscernible], I would start with by taking a step back and saying, we expect double-digit returns across all of our business and we don't look at this business really any differently. If I look specifically at the capital that I'd say is targeted towards the low carbon solutions business so different from the emissions reductions that we're making across our own portfolio, either our existing business or the growth projects and looking to offset those incremental emissions that would come with growth projects.  What I'd say is we look at that and say we think we can see really strong double-digit returns coming from there. Now, we have a lot of biofuel projects that are embedded there, which are supported by current policy. There's Takona project up in Canada would be a great example of that. Clearly, we are seeing some investments. Darren referenced the Houston Hub project where we have to seed those investments today. Carbon capture doesn't need fuller policy support. We referenced that earlier in the discussion today.  But if we don't start to see the planning for those investments, we will be behind when the policy support comes. And it's clear if we're going to make more progress towards a lower carbon future, more policies support does have to come. That is how we're thinking about it, and we see great opportunities in the space that we're targeting where we think the Company really brings advantage. Carbon capture, hydrogen, biofuels is our current focus, and we think we're going to be able to prosecute those projects and earn good returns. Hey. Well, I will start in and I guess the first thing that I would say is, I've been really pleased with how the organization has actually welcomed me. You can imagine coming into a Company like ExxonMobil. I would say I was a little bit anxious about what the receptivity would be, and both at the management committee, I'd say across the senior leadership team and across the Company, people have just been really welcoming, which has been terrific.  The other thing I would say is as I look at many of the companies' processes, I'm really pleased by how rigorous and thorough they are. ExxonMobil puts a lot of work behind things before it comes out and then makes decisions and talks about those things. And so, you mentioned our FID process, which I think is incredibly rigorous.  And the Company added sometime back a process that they call red blue team, which is literally putting really smart people and competing them against each other to say, hey, as we're going to FID this project, tell us what a different perspective is, and whether the project could be even better than what our base economics are, and tell us what a different perspective might be in terms of what some of the call it hidden risks might be in the project, and have we evaluated all of that?  And that's the process where I'd say we take all of those learning's and then the base economics, how we're managing the risks of the projects, just get improved to an even greater level. So, I'd say I've been really pleased just by the thorough work that's done across the Company. And I'd take that even into a different area we haven't talked about it on the call, but obviously net zero is the topic of the day and the Company is clearly doing a lot of work in terms of its own scenario analysis.  We talked a lot about the announcement we made in increasing our investment in the low carbon emission space and again, all I would comment on is that the rigor of the work that you see at the Company is incredible. The work that we're doing on a site by site, location by location basis in staring at our cost curves and the plans and how we're going to reduce our own carbon footprint. I just think it is incredibly thorough and detailed and it's what enables us to really stand strongly behind our plan. So anyway, I've been really pleased and I'm really happy with just how the organization has accepted me as an outsider. I think you already touched a little bit upon what I thought was your last Paul, and that was about Mozambique. And our core project is clearly moving forward and you touched upon the project that we pause simply because of the security situation on the ground, which we'll continue to look at and revisit overtime."

And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Williams, our Senior Vice President, overseeing Downstream and Chemical. In a moment, Darren, will make some introductory comments. I will then cover the quarterly financial and operating results, and then Jack and Darren will provide their perspectives on the business. Following those remarks, we will be happy to address any questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and to the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I will now turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter, starting with the extensive engagement that Board and I had with our shareholders in the months leading up to our Annual Meeting. We received some very explicit feedback that we found valuable, and are incorporating in our plans as we move the company forward. In future, the directors, the management committee, and I look forward to continuing the active shareholder engagement, and discussing the good work going on at the company and the progress we are making on all fronts. Since our Annual Meeting, we welcomed our new directors: Greg Goff, Kaisa Hietala, and Andy Karsner, with a number of discussions that included myself, our Lead Director Ken Frazier, other Board members, and senior managers of the company. In June, we began the new members' onboarding process with in-depth reviews of our businesses and key topics, such as our energy outlook and our approach to the energy transition. While the Board has met virtually on a couple of topics since the Annual Meeting, this week was the first in-person regular meeting of the Board. We had very substantive and productive discussions across both the committees and the full Board. They were informed by the extensive shareholder engagements over the past several months. I'm pleased to say, that without exception, our directors are focused on improving the performance of the company, addressing the challenges faced by our industry, and increasing long-term shareholder value. There is very good alignment on the importance of leveraging the diverse experience and skills of the Board, the important role ExxonMobil will have in the transition helping to lead to the development and deployment of critical technologies, advocating for necessary policy, and making strategically and financially accretive investments, the need to improve transparency and engagement with our shareholders, actively listening and more explicitly addressing concerns, and of course, driving total shareholder return in both the short and long run. While there is still much to do, I think we're working from a very strong foundation. ExxonMobil is proud to be a global leader in the industry. As the energy system evolves with society's needs, we look forward to continuing our role as a leader, helping lead society through the transition, leveraging the deep thinking and analytical rigor of our 20,000 scientists and engineers, and the hard work of all of our people. Another important development in the quarter was the addition of Kathy Mikells to our management committee as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Board, the other members of the management committee, and our entire organization, I want to welcome Kathy and express how excited we are to have her on board. She joins us formally next month and brings significant CFO and Investor Relations experience from her time at Diageo, Xerox, United Airlines, and ADT. In addition to the financial functions, Kathy's portfolio will include Corporate Strategic Planning, Investor Relations, and a number of our global business services like IT and procurement. We look forward to the depth of experience and perspective she will bring. While welcoming Kathy, I'd like to also recognize Andy Swiger's retirement, which was also recently announced. I'd like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the many contributions Andy has made during his 43 years with the company. He has certainly earned his retirement and we all wish him and his wife Sherry the very best. Also of significance in the quarter was the continuing market recovery, which obviously underpins our results. As you will hear, the organization remains very focused on continuing to leverage the changes we've implemented over the last several years and on delivering the plans we've discussed with you in March. As the margin improves, we've maintained a disciplined approach, doing more with less. We remain focused on delivering industry-leading operating performance, continuing to significantly reduce costs, advancing our portfolio of high-return, advantaged projects, executing value-accretive divestments, and rebuilding the strength of our balance sheet. In addition, as a need for climate solutions beyond wind, solar, and electric vehicles grow, we are working to expand our portfolio of strategically and financially accretive low-carbon solutions investments. While still in the early stages, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. I'll come back to this later in the call. At this time, I'll hand it back to Stephen.\nStephen Littleton: Thanks, Darren. I will now walk through developments since the first quarter. Across all three businesses, demand recovery has improved results. In the Upstream, liquids realizations improved significantly versus the first quarter. Production was lower due to seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher scheduled maintenance activity, notably in Canada. We continue to explore and progress development in our advantaged deepwater assets with two discoveries announced in Guyana during the second quarter and a third discovery, Whiptail, announced this week. We also completed final investment decision for the Bacalhau development, offshore Brazil. In the Downstream, global demand improved in line with economic recovery. However, we did see the impact of regional lockdowns, resulting from COVID outbreaks. While there was improved demand for gasoline and diesel, margins continue to be impacted by product oversupply and depressed jet demand, driven by lower international travel. The Chemical business achieved record quarterly earnings with strong reliability and high polyethylene and polypropylene margins, specifically in North America and Europe, due to continued strong demand, tight industry supply, and ongoing shipping constraints. During the quarter, we announced the sale of our global Santoprene business to Celanese for more than $1.1 billion. The transaction includes two manufacturing sites in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Wales and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Earnings improvements across all businesses resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of $2.7 billion in the quarter. Finally, our low-carbon solutions business signed two MOUs to progress large-scale carbon capture and storage projects in Scotland and France. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of second quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of second quarter results relative to the prior quarter. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $4.7 billion, an increase of approximately $2 billion versus the first quarter, primarily due to higher prices or margins and strong reliability. There was a $700 million hurt compared to the prior quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives, for which the physical trading strategy had not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings benefit of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Consistent with prior disclosures, planned maintenance activity impacted earnings by about $800 million in the quarter and was partially offset by lower corporate expenses and favorable tax items. On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results for each business. Upstream earnings improved more than $630 million compared to the first quarter. Higher prices increased earnings by about $1 billion, partially offset by mark-to-market impacts of unsettled derivatives. Tighter supply demand balances increased liquids realizations by 12%. Gas realizations also increased, driven primarily by higher European and LNG gas prices. Increased planned maintenance, primarily in Canada and Australia, impacted earnings by $360 million. Next quarter, we expect lower levels of planned maintenance. Other items were a help of $310 million and included favorable asset management and one-time tax items. On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of Upstream volumes. On average, Upstream volumes decreased by about 200,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter. Gas and liquids were both lower in the quarter, with seasonal gas demand reductions, primarily in Europe, lower entitlements due to higher prices, and the planned maintenance activity that I mentioned earlier. These impacts were partially offset by improved reliability, primarily in Canada and the U.S., and recovery from winter storm impacts experienced in the first quarter. Moving to Slide 8, Downstream earnings improved by approximately $160 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $600 million, but were partially offset by the unsettled mark-to-market impacts I mentioned earlier. We had our best ever lubricants quarterly earnings, driven by improved basestock margins. We have also seen demand improve, particularly in North America retail fuels. During the quarter, planned maintenance and turnarounds reduced earnings by $220 million. We optimized the timing of our Downstream maintenance in the first half of 2021, which positions us well for the continuing economic recovery as we move through the year. We also benefited from the absence of the first quarter refinery to terminal conversion provision for our Altona, Australia and Slagen, Norway refineries, which was included in the other factor. Moving to Chemical on Slide 9, Chemical had its best ever quarterly earnings, delivering over $2.3 billion, more than $900 million improvement versus the first quarter. Margins improved by approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting our continued, reliable operations and tight industry supply conditions, particularly in the polyethylene and polypropylene markets in North America and Europe. Planned seasonal maintenance and turnarounds in Europe reduced earnings by $180 million. The next slide summarizes results versus the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the second quarter of last year, earnings increased by $7.7 billion, driven by a total price margin improvement of about $6.7 billion, and increased sales of $810 million. We had $850 million in planned maintenance, as we successfully stretched maintenance intervals out of 2020 into the first half of this year. This positions us well for a continuing economic recovery in the second half of 2021. Structural efficiencies, lower corporate and financing expenses, and favorable tax items delivered additional earnings benefits. Slide 11 provides further details on investing and cost management. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $18.7 billion during the first half of 2021. In addition to reducing structural costs by $3 billion in 2020, the company has captured over $1 billion in further structural savings in the first half of 2021. The company remains on pace to achieve through 2023 total structural cost reductions of $6 billion relative to 2019. The cost associated with turnarounds, winter storm repairs, and other market and activity based factors were a partial offset. Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $6.9 billion year-to-date. Consistent with our plans, we started the year with lower levels of investment to provide flexibility for responding to market conditions. We remain on track with full-year spending on a lower end of our $16 billion to $19 billion range. Investments in the second half of the year are expected to be higher due to the timing of spend for major Upstream and Chemical projects, including Guyana, Brazil, Permian, and chemical performance products. Moving on to the summary of cash flow on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.7 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this is up about $2 billion from the first quarter, reflecting continued market improvement and ongoing benefits of our cost reductions. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, total debt was reduced to $60.6 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date reductions to over $7 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 13 for the third quarter outlook, in the Upstream, we expect higher volumes with lower planned maintenance. The sale of the UK Central and Northern North Sea assets is now expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory and third party approvals. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement with continued economic recovery. Lower turnarounds and maintenance are planned for the quarter. In Chemical, we anticipate some easing in the tight supply demand balance as industry downtime improves and additional capacity comes online. We also expect lower turnaround impacts next quarter. Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $600 million, and we anticipate further debt reductions if prices and margins remain at current levels. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack.\nJack Williams: Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first six months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow, and debt reduction. We've also made progress in our efforts to reduce emissions, advance lower carbon solutions, and further advance the depth and quality of our portfolio. I'll spend a few minutes providing some highlights and perspectives on this progress, and let's start with a look at the business environment. Second quarter saw a rapidly recovering environment with significant improvement in all our product markets. Oil and gas prices increased materially since the fourth quarter of last year and we're back within the 10-year range, driven largely by economic recovery as the pandemic-related restrictions were relaxed. Downstream margins moved close to the low end of the 10-year band. They continue to be impacted by an unbalanced global refining system, resulting primarily from an oversupply of distillates from low international jet demand. Nonetheless, U.S. demand growth drove substantial improvements from the historic lows of the fourth quarter. Importantly, significant earnings potential remains as the Downstream continues to recover from the lingering effects of the pandemic. And to build on that point and demonstrate just how quickly things can change, Chemical prices and margins were far above the 10-year band and drove record earnings. Chemical's record results were driven by strong base reliability, robust demand, and tight supply for both polyethylene and polypropylene in the North American and European markets. Looking ahead, although we anticipate lengthening of supply and rising feed across the regions, our outlook is for Chemical margins to remain strong in the coming months. Given the dynamic market and record results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking more deeply about the Chemical markets and our business. Starting with a closer look at the current market environment, the last 18 months have been a testament to the underlying resiliency in demand for chemical products, and that is especially true in a surging global economic recovery, as these products are widely needed for food packaging, hygiene, and the recovering automobile sector among others. This year, polyethylene and polypropylene margins across North America and Europe increased by more than 140% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The recovery in Asia has been more challenging due to pockets of COVID resurgence, higher supply, and increased crude and naphtha prices. The strong margins in the Atlantic Basin are the result of several factors, first, hurricane impacts in late 2020, followed by winter storm Uri earlier this year, which reduced inventory levels; second, unplanned industry shutdowns and turnarounds; third, global shipping constraints of finished products caused by port congestion, container availability, and increased shipping costs from Asia to the U.S.; and then finally, demand growth in the U.S. commensurate with growth in GDP. Our Chemical business has benefited from this tightness, with 70% of our polyethylene capacity located in these regions. A material portion of this is typically exported to Asia, but was redirected to Europe and North America, enabling us to capture more than our share of demand growth. The scale, global footprint, and multitude of product lines in our Chemical business provides competitive advantage and strong earnings potential, as amplified in tight markets like today, and is also durable when looking at longer time frames. ExxonMobil Chemical's earnings over the past decade were 80% higher than the industry average. In the first quarter, our earnings were double the industry average and our second quarter result is materially higher than the first. The core strategy of our Chemicals business is growing technology-driven, higher -value performance products. These have proven over the test of time to add significant value for our customers versus commodity chemical products. Our diverse product offerings and global reach are significant advantages. ExxonMobil Chemical is number one or number two in more than 80% of the markets where we compete. This provides resiliency across a wide range of market scenarios and upside in the market like today. In addition to the product diversity, I want to highlight the benefits we've seen this year from three important drivers. First, our ability to optimize feed and unit operations at our integrated facilities and leverage regional feedstock supply chains has generated about $1.4 billion of earnings for the first six months of this year. Second, as we discussed during Investor Day, we've sharpened our focus on making our Chemicals business a leader in cost efficiency. As a result, costs were down significantly in 2020 and even with the higher sales volumes this year, ongoing structural efficiencies, such as digital enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies, and previously announced staffing reductions are expected to support $1 billion in annual reductions versus 2019. And third, the recent advantaged project investments, including the world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker and polyethylene reactors delivered $600 million in earnings in the first half of this year. And there are more advantaged projects in flight today that will grow our supply of performance products and have an even larger impact on earnings. These projects will grow our supply of performance products by 70% by 2027 and grow the earnings contribution by 100% due to the higher-value slate of new products. These products bring significant benefits to our customers. They support lower emissions, improve the performance of technologies that enable the energy transition, and improve efficiencies. And those advantages ultimately are reflected in higher margins. For example, polyethylene packaging has lower lifecycle emissions compared to alternatives. Performance polyethylene like our Exceed XP is stronger, enabling thinner films for the same applications. We're developing the capability to produce certified circular polymers from plastic waste using our proprietary advanced recycling technology and polypropylene used to reduce the way the vehicles improve fuel economy and battery life. The projects gain advantage not just from the higher margin products they produce, but also from advantaged feed, scale, proprietary catalyst technology, and the integration with our existing chemical and downstream facilities and logistics. Our focus going forward remains on advancing a number of major chemical and also downstream projects that will further strengthen our integrated manufacturing platforms and upgrade our product mix to meet a range of future demand scenarios. As you may recall, many of these projects were paced to preserve cash during the market downturn last year. Our Global Projects organization has done an excellent job managing this activity to preserve long-term value. This group of projects are expected to still be completed within the FID estimate. As an aside, this is the same organization that will be delivering future carbon capture projects, advancing through our Low Carbon Solutions business. This capability continues to be an enduring competitive advantage and will only increase in importance going forward. In the Chemical business, our large Corpus Christi chemical complex is ahead of schedule and under budget. We just announced a mechanical completion of the three derivative units, including a monoethylene glycol unit and two polyethylene reactors. Full site start-up is anticipated by year-end. Progress is ongoing at the polypropylene growth project in Baton Rouge, with start-up anticipated next year. Our Baytown chemical plant expansion will include a new Vistamaxx unit and a full range, linear alpha olefins unit. It's on track for a 2023 start-up. Our China1 venture captures the advantage of being located in the world's largest growth market. We signed several important agreements to advance the project, including a contract with Sinopec for basic engineering design, procurement, and construction. In the Downstream, we're moving crude to the Wink to Webster pipeline from the Permian Basin and are preparing to ship third party production in the fourth quarter of this year. At Beaumont, process unit modules are on-site and we're ramping up construction activity for start-up in 2023. And our Singapore and Fawley projects are also progressing. However, they are a bit further out in terms of full project restart. Even in the current challenging refining environment, these Downstream projects are still attractive and materially improve the competitiveness of our integrated sites. If these four projects were online at today's margins, they would be contributing more than $1 billion in annual earnings. For example, our Singapore resid project will produce 20,000 barrels a day of high quality lube basestocks that would have added to our strong lubricants result this quarter. Collectively, this world-class Chemical and Downstream project portfolio delivers 30% returns at 10-year average margins. That's more than $4 billion of annual earnings at 10-year average margins and $2 billion at 10-year low margins. We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive Upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 4,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans. Relative to 2019, we've more than double the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling the Delaware Basin 12,500 foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately three times more efficient than in 2019. Another way to think about this is that the eight rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just two years ago. Completions are improving too. Our frac rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%. Our environmental performance also continues to improve. We achieved record-low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantage short cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameters setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns at $35 a barrel or less. This low price resiliency also applies to our deepwater developments in Guyana and Brazil. In Guyana Stabroek block, we've added three new discoveries since the first quarter, including the Whiptail discovery announced this week. The Uaru-2 well encountered 220 feet of high quality oil bearing reservoirs. The Longtail-3 well encountered 230 feet of net pay, and both of these results included newly identified intervals below the zones originally discovered. Resource quantification is ongoing. The Whiptail-1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay and drilling is ongoing at the Whiptail-2 well, which has encountered 167 feet of net pay, both in high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. This additional resource will add to the 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels we discussed at Investor Day, further increasing our confidence in the resource size and quality in the area east of Liza and supporting our view of an ultimate block-wide footprint of seven to 10 developments. The projects in progress remain on schedule, with the expected arrival of the Liza Phase 2 Unity FPSO in Guyanese waters early in the fourth quarter. Payara, the third major development on the block is on track for a 2024 start-up, with topsides construction ongoing. And pending government approval, we're targeting a final investment decision on Yellowtail, our fourth major development later this year, with start-up planned for 2025. Offshore Brazil, we confirmed the final investment decision on the Bacalhau development during the second quarter and expect this 220,000 barrel a day project to start up in 2024. It will deliver more than a 15% rate of return at $50 a barrel. I'll now turn the call back over to Darren to discuss our Low Carbon Solutions business and long-term plans.\nDarren Woods: Thanks, Jack. Let me shift focus now to the wide range of activities we are pursuing to ensure ExxonMobil plays a key role in the energy transition, while continuing to grow shareholder value. You will recall that earlier this year, we established our Low Carbon Solutions business to develop potential carbon capture and storage opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies and progress commercialization of other lower-emissions technologies. We believe that the depth and breadth of our operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution, subsurface expertise, and ability to scale technology gives us a competitive advantage in what is expected to be a fast-growing market for Low Carbon Solutions. We also believe that the time is right, given the developing market for emission reduction credits and growing recognition of the importance of carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels by both governments and investors, all critical for broad-scale commercialization. The new organization is making steady progress in developing a wide range of attractive opportunities weighted initially towards carbon capture and storage. We've provided a few examples here to give you a sense of the opportunities. Next year, we anticipate final investment decisions for a large CCS expansion at our LaBarge facility in Wyoming and a new carbon capture technology pilot associated with the Porthos project in Rotterdam. This quarter, we signed an MOU to explore the development of CO2 infrastructure to help decarbonize the industrial basin in the Normandy region of France, and an MOU to participate in the recently announced Acorn CCS project in Scotland. We are continuing to pursue several Gulf Coast opportunities, including our Houston hub concept, which are all gaining industry and third-party support. In addition to carbon capture and storage, we're advancing a number of options to produce low-emissions biofuels. These include new projects, repurposing existing refinery units, co-processing bio feeds and purchase agreements. These plans would enable the production of more than 40,000 barrels per day of low-emission fuels by 2025. We also recently completed a successful trial to co-process bio feed across our existing refining circuit. Co-processing bio feeds is a key technology that can be rapidly scaled to help society quickly lower emissions, provided the right policies are in place. In addition, during the quarter, we expanded a previous agreement with alternative fuels developer, Global Clean Energy, to annually purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel. This is basically a drop in lower carbon fuel that meets all finished product specs for today's engines. Commercial production is expected to begin next year. In markets where low carbon fuels policies incentivize the development of lower-emission fuels, like California and Canada, scale opportunities exist. We see the potential to leverage our existing facility footprint, proprietary catalyst technology, and decades of experience in processing challenging feed streams to develop attractive low-emission fuels projects with competitive returns. An effectively designed low carbon fuel standard in the U.S. could accelerate significant CO2 reductions in the hard-to-abate transportation segment at a cost much lower than some existing policy. While we advocate for new policies, such as a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard and develop future projects, we continue to lead the industry in developing and deploying new technologies to address another important issue, reducing methane emissions. To that end, we have conducted more than 23,000 leak surveys on more than 5 million components at over 9,500 locations. We are eliminating high-bleed pneumatic devices across our U.S. unconventional production, and participating as a founding member in industry initiatives to improve detection and reduction of methane leaks. ExxonMobil is also the first company to file an application with the EPA to use airplanes equipped with methane detection technology to conduct large flyover inspections, and we're evaluating satellite technology in support of our 2025 reduction plans for both methane intensity and absolute methane emissions. These ongoing efforts to commercialize Low Carbon Solutions and reduce emissions are central to our long-term plan to grow shareholder value. As markets and policies continue to evolve, we will be there playing our part, contributing where we bring the most value. In the near term, as we begin the development of next year's plan, our organization is focused on continuing to deliver industry-leading operating performance, building on last year's record results in safety and reliability, and extending our trend of annual reductions in emissions intensity by accelerating the pace of reductions and establishing more aggressive objectives. This will enable us to reduce our own emissions at a pace faster than what the countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. It will also help accelerate our objective of industry leadership in greenhouse gas performance by the end of the decade. Of course, we remain focused on sustained financial discipline. We are developing plans consistent with our existing commitments to deliver $6 billion of annual structural savings by the end of 2023, manage future capital investments, including new low carbon projects within previously announced CapEx ranges, and restoring the strength of our balance sheet, returning debt to levels consistent with a strong AA rating. As our results demonstrate, we've made good progress in improving our competitiveness, but we're not satisfied. Our plans will focus on driving a further step change. We see a significant opportunity to capture scale and integration benefits from our recent reorganizations, improving efficiency, effectiveness, and growing additional cash flow. To strengthen the earnings and cash flow potential of our assets, our plans will continue to advance high-return, advantaged projects and high-grade our existing assets through accretive divestments. Finally, as I have illustrated, we're stepping up and accelerating efforts to ensure the company plays a meaningful role in the energy transition. Our plans will reflect the continuing development and deployment of needed technologies, and where the appropriate incentives are in place, accretive investments. As we finalize our plans later this year, we'll provide additional updates with a more detailed review at our next Investor Day. Reflecting back on the past half year, we're pleased with the results the organization's hard work has delivered in a recovering market. We've made a lot of progress, as demonstrated by our year-to-date performance, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. We appreciate your participation in today's call. I look forward to answering your questions.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, Darren. Operator, please open up the phone lines.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Woods, Mr. Williams, and Mr. Littleton. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh: Hey, good morning, Darren.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Phil.\nPhil Gresh: So just going back to your earlier remarks about all the discussions that you've had with the Board recently, I'm curious what you take away from that as to whether you have any new or incremental thoughts about the best way to drive increased value to shareholders from here. You kind of went through some items there at the very end, but on the margin, do you feel like you've learned anything different from these discussions? And if you could layer in some thoughts around CapEx and balance sheet in that, that'd be helpful? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes, thanks, Phil. Good to hear from you this morning. Yes, I think the one point I would make in terms of the context to the response is it's fairly early in the process, as I said in my opening comments. We've only had the one meeting with the Board, but I would tell you that meeting was very encouraging. The other point I would make is, actually, the new Board has formed at a very good time with respect to our typical cycle with to - and managing the business. We have just kicked off our corporate plan process that runs through the end of November. And so we, with the new Board, went through the basis of the plan and the objectives that we are setting ourselves. We had an opportunity for a very rich conversation about that and what we need the organization to deliver this year and continuing this year and into next year and the years ahead. We also have a bi-annual strategy process that we have in place, which this year, we are doing in September and the new Board will basically have an opportunity to really dig into and go through the strategies that we've developed with all of our business, including our new business, low-carbon solutions and the broader corporate profile. So I expect as we go through this year to get a lot of good conversations about where the company is going, the opportunities that are ahead of us, and where we want to put our emphasis. I think I would say the fundamental approach that we have taken is very, I'd say, is a pretty good alignment amongst the Board. I think they all recognize that the opportunity for us to take a leadership role in this space and just leveraging the capabilities and advantages we currently have. And so, finding the opportunities that fit well with where we can add the most value is, I think, a very aligned objective amongst the Board, and of course you've heard me talk about that, I mentioned in my opening comments. The broader conversation network this society is now having, governments are now having around the solution sets needed to address the transition, I think, opens the door to a much richer conversation about where ExxonMobil can play and contribute carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, biofuels, other areas potentially where that leverage our strength. So I think we're - the things are lining up very well within the company, and then I would say more externally in the broader environment. With respect to CapEx in the balance sheet, as you mentioned, I think, again, good alignment around the importance of rebuilding the strength of the balance sheet. Everyone recognizes this is a commodity market with some significant cycles and volatility, and making sure that we've got a balance sheet that we can lean on as we move through that volatile environment and manage the downs, as well as the ups, is a really important foundational piece of our strategy, and I think very good alignment on that. And that was reaffirmed in the conversations we had this week with our finance committee and the broader Board. And I think, too, given the improvements we've made around capital efficiencies, the work our global project organization has done to really make sure that we can deliver these projects with - at a very advantaged cost. We're very confident that we can do the things that we want to do, add some additional activities in the low-carbon solutions, and do all of that within the range of CapEx that we've previously communicated. And I think, again, good alignment on that and we will confirm that as we move to plan cycle and have those reviews with the Board later this year.\nPhil Gresh: Got it. Okay. And as a follow-up, just on the spending side and with respect to your comments, it sounds like, if you were to stick with the $20 billion to $25 billion range, which would be up a decent amount from the low end of the $16 billion to $19 billion range this year. Should we be seeing more of an acceleration around energy transition spending kind of embedded in that? Is that how you envision things moving forward versus how you thought about in the past?\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would say that the energy transition spending will be embedded in the range that we've laid out. I think though, it's good to keep some perspective in this space. If you think about the comments around the broader opportunity set opening up and a broader recognition of the need for that opportunity sets, I'm referring to carbon capture, hydrogen, that's a very rapidly evolving space. And so, while we've got a really, I think, good portfolio of opportunities, some of them very attractive that the time to transition from the planning and the development of those projects to steel in the ground is going to take some time, we'll be talking about that and the investments that we're planning going forward. And then, of course, the steel in the ground will come with time across the horizon that we typically talk about. And all of that's expected to be within the 20 to 25 range.\nPhil Gresh: Got it. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet, Phil.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jon Rigby with UBS.\nJon Rigby: Thank you. Yes. Can I ask a question on the Downstream? I listened to what Jack said about the Chemicals and the huge competitive advantage Exxon continues to demonstrate in Chemical. If you could turnaround that comment and sort of see it in reverse in the Downstream, where the series of loss-making quarters is pretty unusual and looks like underperformance versus your peers. Are there any takeaways from those quarters that you could share with us around sort of the structural makeup of that business, or are you just relying on the cycle for those earnings and cash flows to recover?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Thanks, Jon, and good morning. I'll - I'm going to hand it to Jack here to get maybe more specifics, maybe a couple of broader comments that you point, that it is unusual given the consecutive quarters of challenged results in the Downstream. But I would also say, going through the pandemic and losing over half of the jet demand, coming out of the refining circuit is very unusual as well. And I think a very discrete and unique event associated with the global pandemic. So I think that context is really important to keep in mind as you think about our Downstream business and the results. The other point that I would just make with respect to your comment or question is, I think, when you talk about the Downstream and compare across competitors, you've got to recognize the difference in the footprints and the investments in capital assets that we have. I would tell you, as you look across our competitive group, we are much more heavily weighted in refining than some of our competitors. And so, obviously, in an environment where refining margins are structurally down, performance is going to look different. And I think it's really important and certainly to what we focus on is making sure we normalize and understand what aspects are driving the performance. And I would say, our capital structure, the investments that we've made over the years are a really important part of that.  I'd also tell you that what I refer to as the physics of this business is, and you can't stay at these low levels and continue with the level of supply that has historically existed in the Downstream, and you see that today with the shutdowns that are incurring in the industry. And so, while that takes some time, this market will come back into balance and if it's anything like we've seen in the crude, when that economic recovery kicks in, we're going to see supply and demand tighten, I suspect, and I think we'll see a different level of performance with respect to the Downstream and with respect to our peers. But obviously, that will be a function of that balance and when that economic recovery comes back around again. And I'll just make one final point in terms of - we are not relying on just the cycle, we recognize the impact of the cycle, but I can assure you that that Downstream organization is very focused on ensuring that we're pulling as many of value levers as we can in the right way to build sustained and structural improvements that will benefit us obviously in this down cycle, but also in the up cycle. Well, with that, let me turn it over to Jack. I don't know if I left anything, Jack.\nJack Williams: Well, I did want to pick up on the refining exposure versus some of the others. We do have a - as the largest refiner, I would say refiner, we do have quite a bit exposure to that market. And we talked about in the fourth quarter how historical low that was, and we are seeing some recovery. But due to the jet demand, that's going to take a little bit of time. I did mention in my prepared remarks that these new investments that we are making will help, and the recent ones we have made have helped. The Rotterdam investment has made a couple hundred million dollars this year, and that will continue to help. So we are investing to continue to grow advantage in our - in what is a, difficult right now, fuels value chain. But picking up on the Rotterdam comment, our lubricants business has done quite well over the past couple of years. As a matter of fact, having a record year last year and extremely strong results so far this year. So that is a kind of balance to the fuels, a tough refining fuels market. We - I mentioned the integration of our refining with our chemicals. 75% of our refineries are integrated with chemicals and others are in advantaged market. So we're making sure - we want to make sure that refineries we have going forward are advantaged, and that's what these investments are about, making sure the ones that we think are - have natural advantages, we build on those advantages. And then just in terms of Darren's comment about kind of the physics of refining, we see about almost 3 million barrels a day rationalization over the past year, 18 months. So it's definitely quite a bit above where it has been historically, and we'll just have to see how that plays out, but we are seeing a slow - slower than we hoped recovery refining environment.\nJon Rigby: And just a follow-up. Darren, you mentioned at the start - you sort of referenced some of the responsibilities that Kathryn will be taking on when she takes on the role of the CFO, and I think you indicated IR responsibilities, strategic planning, et cetera. But it is unusual, very unusual to appoint somebody from outside of the organization at such a senior role and also somebody without oil and gas experience. So I just wondered whether you could just expand a little bit around the sort of qualities and experience that she brings that will add value, or will add to the process at the high level of Exxon.\nDarren Woods: Sure. And then maybe, just as, I think, very important context to understand what's enabled that change or evolution. And I've talked before, I think, with all of you about the reorganizations and the consolidations and the changes that we've been making in how we run the business. If you look at the senior, the corporate officers in the organization, we've reduced that group by almost 40% over the years in terms of - as we simplify the business, line up the value chains, reduce the overhead, and we were able to make significant simplifications in that structure and then reduce numbers. And that also allows us to concentrate consolidate some of the responsibility. So as we've made those changes with time, we've been able to shape the portfolio of the management committee members and focus them on core areas. And so, we're in a position today where as we've consolidated those responsibilities and focus them, that we're creating a management committee position that's much more aligned today with what would be typical CFO type responsibilities versus in the past where we had much broader number of businesses and therefore, a much broader reporting relationship up into Dallas. So that simplification has enabled our ability to focus and bring these portfolios in line with what would be some more industry standard opportunities, which then led us, and through Board discussions last year, to start thinking about how we can expand the capabilities, the skill sets, the experience on the management committee, and bring in what we think is some relevant experience into a portfolio that's consistent with and shaped with outside industry experience, and the - obviously understanding the industry is going to be an important role with that. I think we've got a pretty capable team and organization that understands that industry very well. It's going to support Kathy with respect to that, as she comes up the learning curve there. But I also think she will bring in a lot of perspective from the outside that's very relevant to the business, along some of those core areas, including procurement and supply chains, and some the other areas of responsibility. So I think there is - that change in our structure and approach to running the business has opened up some nice opportunities and we think bringing in that diversity of thought, experience, and perspective is actually going to benefit, and obviously we'll supplement that with our industry knowledge. I think the mix will be a very powerful combination.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Darren, I'm going to try and ask this as eloquently as I can, if you can bear with me for a minute, to address the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which obviously was the Board changings. The press would have us believe that you lost a climate fight. But all the discussions that we've had with some of your large shareholders suggest it was an issue of capital discipline, spending, dividend protection. And my question really is that Exxon is already a leader in carbon capture. You're already leading through the methane partnership. You've been doing a lot of things for a long time, and you have got one of the best portfolios of growth opportunities in the industry that can drive sustainable dividend growth. A lot of your peers mismanaged the cycle. Now, where some might say you spend a little bit too aggressively, the bottom line is, you've still got those opportunities. So can you give us some assurances that just to tick a box, you're not going to sacrifice returns relative - on a relative basis across the portfolio?\nDarren Woods: I think that's an easy answer to give you, Doug. That has been a primary focus for us for a long, long time, it's certainly when I've been in the job. And as you know from past conversations, the work that we've been doing to reshape the organization, to get more effective at running the business, and then importantly, recapitalizing the business with advantaged assets and supply has been a really important focus, and I think the work that we've done in the past has put us in a very solid position to continue to contribute. I think everybody on the Board is realistic with respect to the challenges facing society with this transition and the work that's going to be required by everybody, ourselves, the rest of industry, governments around the world, other industries, and consumers to make changes on that transition and that will take time. And I think as you look at a lot of the independent third-parties' assessments, they all recognize that this is a challenging area that's going to require a lot of work and expertise in that our industry has an important role to play in helping with that transition, but very importantly, and continuing to meet the need for energy and existing sources of energy. And so, that's the balance that we're trying to strike. And of course, I think one of the - and how that transition evolves and the uncertainty associated with it, obviously everyone could take a different view on that. Our view is the way you help manage some of that uncertainty while you're continuing to meet current demand is to make sure that what you're doing is very advantaged, and on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, which is what we've been focused on, what we've been talking about. So, we think we've got a really good portfolio of high-return projects that are advantaged versus the rest of industry. And so, as time goes on and that uncertainty begins to manifest itself, we think irrespective of how that - the shape of that curve, we're still going to be in a very good position. And so, I think strong recognition within the Board that's the advantage that we've created, and I think commitment to continue to leverage that advantage as we look at opportunities in this space of transition. And the final point I would make to try to reassure you, Doug, is, I think, one of the - if you go back 18 months, I would say, the litmus test for whether or not somebody was committed to helping manage the transition was whether we are investing in solar and wind. Of course, we were concerned about the returns you can generate in that and the value that we bring to that sector. My sense is, over the last 18 months, the broader conversation has quickly evolved and there is this recognition today that more solutions are needed and solutions that fit into our skill set and solutions where we have been working on creating advantage. So, I'm confident that as the need for carbon capture is recognized and projects are being advanced in that space, for biofuels or hydrogen, that the work that we've done and the technology and the fundamentals of carving out advantage there, that we will generate a above industry, above average return for the things that we do in that space.\nDoug Leggate: Go ahead.\nJack Williams: I would just add to that real quick. If you think about the projects that I talked about, the Chemical and Downstream projects, the Permian and Guyana, very, very good strong returns, industry leading returns from that portfolio. I feel as good about that portfolio as I've ever felt in terms of the projects - project returns we have, Doug. So, I think we're pursuing high returns.\nDoug Leggate: Yes, Thank you for the full answer, guys. My follow-up actually, Jack, is for you and hopefully, it's a quick one after that full answer. It really is a follow-up on the Downstream comment earlier, one of the questions about consecutive quarters of weakness, but I would also - my question, I guess, is Chemicals is hitting on all cylinders, and I understand your business after over 25 years, Jack. It's been about optimizing between those two. So to the extent you can, can you characterize to what extent decisions made to maximize Chemical's profitability may be detrimental in your system to refining? Should we look at the two businesses together? And I guess that - what I'm really trying to get at is coming out of this recovery, when would you see the investments in refining specific start to show up as improved returns.\nJack Williams: Yes. Doug, I think you're getting at the value of the integrated sites and the tight integration between our Chemicals and Downstream organizations, which is absolutely valuable and we can look at those integrated sites and find several hundred million dollars a quarter of value-add, real bottom line value-add with all of these streams moving back and forth. And what we're doing, I think, an even better job of in recent years is looking at the whole portfolio together. And for instance, the Singapore project is a both a Downstream and Chemicals project and you'll see more of those, I think, where we're involving both sides of the business and creating additional value there. So, I think that integration, we view is a real strength going forward, as you think about the whole energy transition and to move forward there, I think it's going to be even more valuable, as we think about molecule management and increase in the value of all those molecules coming into our integrated complexes.\nDarren Woods: I think, the other point I'd add, Doug is, you're right about is a little artificial to split between refining and chemical, because you've got molecules flowing back and forth, and the only other point I would add to what Jack said was if you think in the area of recycling plastic and some of the work we've been doing for advanced recycling, we're actually using our refinery footprint to recycle plastic into the Chemical business. And so, it is somewhat arbitrary. We try to make sure we understand the drivers behind each of those, but where you choose to draw the line, obviously, is an internal choice, and we're not thinking about it so much along those lines, it's really around how do you maximize the value at the whole.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: A couple of operating questions for me. There is a pretty clear inflection in Upstream U.S. earnings even compared to sort of the last cycle, right, when oil prices may have been very strong, but Upstream had a lot of capital employed and there was differentials. Now, all that seems to be out and Upstream net income in the U.S. is better than it's been in a long time. So I wonder if that's on plan. It seems like it is, because you invested a lot in infrastructure to enhance that, but just if that's altering any of your conceptions of sort of capital allocation and CapEx tilting here, particularly with respect to the Permian.\nJack Williams: Yes, let me, - I'll answer that one, Sam. I think when you're talking about U.S., you talking about the Permian. That's what - from the Upstream perspective, that's what's going to be driving our results there. And I think the slide I showed pretty much demonstrated why that - - you're seeing that bottom line earnings improvement. We're really improving the development efficiency in the Permian, really hitting on all cylinders, getting the sort of efficiencies that we've been targeting for last couple of years, and really hitting those three priorities we talked about, in terms of increasing cash flow and capital efficiency, and really driving those development costs. So as we look going forward in the Permian, we're going to be looking at making sure we hold on to those efficiencies that we've captured, making sure that we - those we sustainable, and then continue to work the technology there, and we see some additional benefits of technology being applied to that program. And as we do that, you get confidence that those benefits are sustainable, we've got the technology built in and we'll be growing that program over time.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I'd add, Sam, that we are actually ahead of our plan with respect to the improvements and the work that we did early on with the delineation, the infrastructure we put aboveground, all of that, spending at the front end to position ourselves as we move forward. And if you recall, the talk we had about technology and what we wanted to do there, that's all coming to fruition. And then, I think as we move forward, it's how we make sure we're continuing to leverage that effectively, and that's an ongoing area of focus and discussion because we see good value there, good opportunities, but we're going to make sure that we hang on to the gains and continue to leverage that effectively.\nJack Williams: So, we have the first train of the large infrastructure plant we have up in Poker Lake is full, and we have that connected to our Wink terminal, and our Wink terminal connected all the way into the Gulf Coast. So we have set up that infrastructure now and it's starting to click in terms of bottom line performance.\nSam Margolin: Thanks. And then just a follow-up on asset sales, you're paying down debt organically at a pretty healthy pace here. Asset sales were important in prior calls, because they were built into your production outlook too, and it created sort of a flat production outlook, even though you are reinvesting a lot in new assets. I wonder if asset sales are still something that is important to the program, or if we should think about kind of net production growth with a lower emphasis on asset sales over the next four years?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sam, I'd tell you that the emphasis has not changed and I think the way you've characterize it isn't exactly how we were thinking about. Our drive for divestments and asset sales is really around focusing on concentrating our assets in the areas where we have advantage, where we can leverage some of our organizational capabilities, and so it's really around focusing the portfolio and highgrading it, and that continues to be a really important part of our work there. And so, that whole divestment discussion that we've had in the past continues to hold. You'll recall, last year we said, given the market dynamics and the impact of the pandemic that that was probably going to slow the pace of those. It certainly didn't slow our activities, and I would tell you today, our activities haven't slowed, and what we're seeing now with additional buyer interest, my expectation is, as we move forward, if we can find deal space there, we'll continue to continue to see those things play themselves out.\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Coming back to some of the opening comments you had, Darren, and some of the questions you've got on here, as we think about new Board, strategies that you've had, maybe some changes, do you think we wait until next March at the Investor Day for any sort of new unveiling of what a different Board could provide, or do you think from what you've seen so far, most of what we've heard makes sense right, get the balance sheet fixed, you've already made a lot of changes on the CapEx front, you do have a tremendous backlog of projects across the Upstream and the Chemicals and Downstream, which you've highlighted here, or do you think that we're in kind of a stasis and we simply have to wait six months to find out anything you run different?\nDarren Woods: No, I would say - I think, actually, we started a different approach last year that was maybe overwhelmed or mixed up with some of proxy action that was going on, but we had committed last year to start a more of a continuum and discussions and talking and put less emphasis on the Investor Day big bang and more, what I would say is, continuing dialog about where the business is going. And so, after we had our plan endorsed by the Board, we put out a press release that gave some highlights. I talked about it in our fourth quarter call and then rolled into the Investor Day. I would tell you that continues to be the new approach that we want to take. I think that was reinforced by a lot of the discussions that we had with shareholders and this desire for continued transparency and more engaged dialogues. And so, we're committed to continuing to do that. My expectation was, as the Board goes through its deliberations, as our organization develop plans and options, that you're going to see a more of a continuum in the discussion and the evolution of those plans going forward. I think again, I'd just reiterate, if you look at the foundational elements of our strategy, which is really leveraging the strengths of our corporation, the technology, the ability to scale, our projects organization, the capital capabilities that we have, a lot of those fundamentals, those have not changed. And the work that we are doing in technology to advance as what we believe are going to be important solutions to adjust to address transition - the transition, that hasn't changed. In fact, what I would tell you is, there's probably even more appetite around that. So if you think about the fundamentals, what we can bring to the equation, and then what's needed, given that those remain fairly constant, I think, I wouldn't see huge shifts in the strategy, but you may see accelerations, additional emphasis in areas, and continuing to leverage on those cores and how they manifest themselves. We're committed to leveraging the new perspectives and experience and capabilities we've brought into the Board. That was part - in part, some of the reasons that we made some of those changes. And so, we've got a really good experience set today, and how we leverage that in our thinking and what opportunities that develops, I think we'll come out of our strategy and plan discussions and we'll talk to you all about that as that thinking evolves and gets translated into plans and actions.\nRoger Read: That is great, thanks. Glad it won't be months of wondering what's next. Second question I had for you, looking at the Upstream performance this quarter, which actually was pretty good and then dovetailing that with the expectation for the additional $3 billion of OpEx savings, which I recognize is spread across the company, but if we look at your peer that reported today, they returned about the same amount of net income on a lower production volume number. And I know at any quarter, there is moving parts and doing an exact comparison is a little bit unfair, but it is a meaningful number of equality across two different companies. And I was wondering as you think about the OpEx savings to come, that $3 billion, and the Q2 performance, kind of where you think you are today and where you think you might be by the end of 2023 when all that's run through, as we think about profitability of the Upstream?\nDarren Woods: Well, I would - I guess, a couple of thoughts with respect to that - to your question, Roger. First of all, I'd link back to the comment that we had in the Downstream, not all volumes are created equal. And so, when you talk about Upstream and volumes, I think you really got to step back and look at the mix of those volumes and the resource types that you're in and the location of the resources. And so, I think again, while it ultimately is a function of what you deliver and so, no excuses there, it's just understanding that and what leverage you have to affect it, which ties into - so I think you start with your portfolio and how do you feel about that and where are the opportunities to improve it are, which comes back to the capital we've been investing in the Upstream with the view that we got to - we're focused on bringing in more profitable, higher-value barrels and the divestment work that we've been doing, which we just touched on, which is taking the areas, the volumes in some of the projects were an asset that you feel like it may have a higher value to others and shifting those out of our portfolio. So that highgrading of the portfolio and the resulting change in the mix of our barrels and volumes, I think, is a very important part of the equation and one of the things we've been very focused on. I would just tell you, that is a big driver as you look across the competitive landscape, and one of the reasons why we've been so focused on that space. And then above and beyond that, when you think about the organizational construct, how you're managing that, the focus that you've got, end-to-end focus along that value chain, that has been a very big change that we've made in the organization. I think we're seeing the benefits of that today in how we're running Upstream, and my expectation is we'll continue to see additional benefits manifest themselves with time. And that's with respect to effectiveness and responding more effectively to market signals and delivering value there, and it's also a function of efficiency in terms of additional cost reduction. So, I would expect to continue to see an evolving, improving business in the Upstream, just as I expect to see that in our Chemical and Downstream business.\nRoger Read: Great, thank you.\nJack Williams: In addition, Roger, to the divestments and the OpEx and efficiency work we're doing, just the profitability of the investments, I've mentioned earlier, there is not any other - Guyana doesn't have a peer out there right now, and we have a large position there and continue to grow it. So it's going to make a big impact over time.\nDarren Woods: Operator, we probably have time for one more question.\nOperator:\nQ - Jason Gabelman:\nJason Gabelman: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I first wanted to come back to shareholder distributions, if I can. It looks like the quarterly dividend has been flat for, now, a couple of years. Can you just discuss if there was start, an increase in the dividend this quarter, what needs to happen to increase the dividend moving forward, and maybe connect that to debt levels, and connected to that, what do you consider some sort of shareholder distribution strategy that gives cash to shareholders as oil prices are kind of above any long-term trend you expect? And then my second question is on Chemicals. It seems like the segment kind of has a lack of transparency with two respects, one in their performance product earnings, and two, on benefits to greenhouse gas emissions. So on the performance products, can you discuss what that's contributing currently, if there was kind of an outsized benefit because of the overall Chemicals' environment strength, and what kind of a normalized earnings looks like moving forward in that performance products? And then related to emissions, you mentioned that the performance products really helped with emissions reductions, but Exxon maybe doesn't get that benefit because it's not like a Scope 3 reduction, or your own emissions reductions. Is there any thought to supporting kind of emissions reporting scheme that awards Exxon for producing products that helps the world reduce emissions, even if it doesn't reduce your own emissions? That's it. Sorry, I know that was a lot, but I appreciate it.\nDarren Woods: I appreciate your questions, Jason, and I'm going to - I will let Jack talk to the chemical piece of your question and I'll address the capital allocation. I will though, just on the Chemical one, we do look at that in terms of the product emissions and we do recognize the opportunity that Chemicals brings in terms of helping society achieve that lower emissions. That is something that we talk a lot about. We've - gas is another one I would add, with respect to the alternatives that are out there today. So it is an important part of the equation that we think about and continue to work. And I'm less focused on how you take credit for it, more focused on making sure that it happens. But I'll let Jack spend some more time on that. With respect to your capital allocation and the dividends, I would tell you that the foundational elements of our capital allocation remain unchanged with respect to making sure that we're finding high-return, industry-advantaged investments, because that underpins basically everything else we do for the long term. We are a capital-intensive industry and so you better be making sure that you've got a good program of investments in capital, particularly in the depletion side of the business. And maintaining the balance sheet has always been an important part we do down heavily and that advantage paid off last year, and we're going to rebuild that. So as you said, that's part of our strategy. And then shareholders distributions have been the third leg of that stool and an important aspect. And so with respect to that question you heard, we think we've got a good plan on our investments and the range that we'll be investing going forward. We're making good progress on the debt, particularly given the higher-price environments than anticipated. And then on distribution, it is part of the conversation and discussions we've had. I would tell you, we have always felt a very strong commitment to our base shareholders to deliver on a dividend, a reliable and growing dividend, and that continues to be part of the conversation, and I would say the Board would like to continue to deliver on that commitment. And so we're continued - we're committed to that, a reliable dividend and one that grows with time. And obviously, if we're maintaining capital in the range that we won't - we get our debt back to levels that assure us the ability to ride through the cycles, and we've got a manageable dividend that's reliable and growing, recognizing anytime you raised the dividend, that brings of the burden up. We want to - we're going to continue to do that, but at the same time there, we want to manage that total outlay in the dividend. And so, buybacks and other distributions become part of that equation, particularly when to redistribute cash. So that's all on the table, and I think as we move through this year, and depending on where price is at, those opportunities will grow in relevance. And with a capital program that's pretty well defined and a debt that we - objective that's pretty well defined, you've got this opportunity on the distributions that I think the Board will continue to evaluate as we go forward.\nJack Williams: So back on the performance products, there are - it's about, think about - that's about a third of our product portfolio in Chemicals, and I showed you that's going to grow at 70% by 2027 and, importantly, grow earnings more, and that's because that 10% to 25% uplift we generally get on our performance products. And I think that was demonstrated, if you look at this quarter. A lot of - almost all the chemical companies benefited from the dynamics we had in the quarter, but you saw the earnings power of our Chemicals company because of this higher margin, because of the technology we bring in those performance products. And the other advantage those have and when you think about all our investments going forward, these investments are focused on generating those performance products, and they're not more capital-intensive, this is catalyst technology. So it's not more capital-intensive and yet, we get - we're having - we're generating a product that gets 10% to 25% more margin. So you can imagine those investments look more profitable as well. So it's a key part of our strategy going forward and we're - we'll just continue to double down on that in terms of the technology improvements and growing those products preferential to the rest of our Chemical portfolio.\nStephen Littleton: Okay, Thank you. I want to thank Darren and Jack for joining us on the call. And I also want to thank all those on the line. We appreciate your interest and opportunity to highlight our second quarter results. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, and please be safe.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jack Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first six months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow, and debt reduction. We've also made progress in our efforts to reduce emissions, advance lower carbon solutions, and further advance the depth and quality of our portfolio. I'll spend a few minutes providing some highlights and perspectives on this progress, and let's start with a look at the business environment. Second quarter saw a rapidly recovering environment with significant improvement in all our product markets. Oil and gas prices increased materially since the fourth quarter of last year and we're back within the 10-year range, driven largely by economic recovery as the pandemic-related restrictions were relaxed. Downstream margins moved close to the low end of the 10-year band. They continue to be impacted by an unbalanced global refining system, resulting primarily from an oversupply of distillates from low international jet demand. Nonetheless, U.S. demand growth drove substantial improvements from the historic lows of the fourth quarter. Importantly, significant earnings potential remains as the Downstream continues to recover from the lingering effects of the pandemic. And to build on that point and demonstrate just how quickly things can change, Chemical prices and margins were far above the 10-year band and drove record earnings. Chemical's record results were driven by strong base reliability, robust demand, and tight supply for both polyethylene and polypropylene in the North American and European markets. Looking ahead, although we anticipate lengthening of supply and rising feed across the regions, our outlook is for Chemical margins to remain strong in the coming months. Given the dynamic market and record results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking more deeply about the Chemical markets and our business. Starting with a closer look at the current market environment, the last 18 months have been a testament to the underlying resiliency in demand for chemical products, and that is especially true in a surging global economic recovery, as these products are widely needed for food packaging, hygiene, and the recovering automobile sector among others. This year, polyethylene and polypropylene margins across North America and Europe increased by more than 140% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The recovery in Asia has been more challenging due to pockets of COVID resurgence, higher supply, and increased crude and naphtha prices. The strong margins in the Atlantic Basin are the result of several factors, first, hurricane impacts in late 2020, followed by winter storm Uri earlier this year, which reduced inventory levels; second, unplanned industry shutdowns and turnarounds; third, global shipping constraints of finished products caused by port congestion, container availability, and increased shipping costs from Asia to the U.S.; and then finally, demand growth in the U.S. commensurate with growth in GDP. Our Chemical business has benefited from this tightness, with 70% of our polyethylene capacity located in these regions. A material portion of this is typically exported to Asia, but was redirected to Europe and North America, enabling us to capture more than our share of demand growth. The scale, global footprint, and multitude of product lines in our Chemical business provides competitive advantage and strong earnings potential, as amplified in tight markets like today, and is also durable when looking at longer time frames. ExxonMobil Chemical's earnings over the past decade were 80% higher than the industry average. In the first quarter, our earnings were double the industry average and our second quarter result is materially higher than the first. The core strategy of our Chemicals business is growing technology-driven, higher -value performance products. These have proven over the test of time to add significant value for our customers versus commodity chemical products. Our diverse product offerings and global reach are significant advantages. ExxonMobil Chemical is number one or number two in more than 80% of the markets where we compete. This provides resiliency across a wide range of market scenarios and upside in the market like today. In addition to the product diversity, I want to highlight the benefits we've seen this year from three important drivers. First, our ability to optimize feed and unit operations at our integrated facilities and leverage regional feedstock supply chains has generated about $1.4 billion of earnings for the first six months of this year. Second, as we discussed during Investor Day, we've sharpened our focus on making our Chemicals business a leader in cost efficiency. As a result, costs were down significantly in 2020 and even with the higher sales volumes this year, ongoing structural efficiencies, such as digital enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies, and previously announced staffing reductions are expected to support $1 billion in annual reductions versus 2019. And third, the recent advantaged project investments, including the world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker and polyethylene reactors delivered $600 million in earnings in the first half of this year. And there are more advantaged projects in flight today that will grow our supply of performance products and have an even larger impact on earnings. These projects will grow our supply of performance products by 70% by 2027 and grow the earnings contribution by 100% due to the higher-value slate of new products. These products bring significant benefits to our customers. They support lower emissions, improve the performance of technologies that enable the energy transition, and improve efficiencies. And those advantages ultimately are reflected in higher margins. For example, polyethylene packaging has lower lifecycle emissions compared to alternatives. Performance polyethylene like our Exceed XP is stronger, enabling thinner films for the same applications. We're developing the capability to produce certified circular polymers from plastic waste using our proprietary advanced recycling technology and polypropylene used to reduce the way the vehicles improve fuel economy and battery life. The projects gain advantage not just from the higher margin products they produce, but also from advantaged feed, scale, proprietary catalyst technology, and the integration with our existing chemical and downstream facilities and logistics. Our focus going forward remains on advancing a number of major chemical and also downstream projects that will further strengthen our integrated manufacturing platforms and upgrade our product mix to meet a range of future demand scenarios. As you may recall, many of these projects were paced to preserve cash during the market downturn last year. Our Global Projects organization has done an excellent job managing this activity to preserve long-term value. This group of projects are expected to still be completed within the FID estimate. As an aside, this is the same organization that will be delivering future carbon capture projects, advancing through our Low Carbon Solutions business. This capability continues to be an enduring competitive advantage and will only increase in importance going forward. In the Chemical business, our large Corpus Christi chemical complex is ahead of schedule and under budget. We just announced a mechanical completion of the three derivative units, including a monoethylene glycol unit and two polyethylene reactors. Full site start-up is anticipated by year-end. Progress is ongoing at the polypropylene growth project in Baton Rouge, with start-up anticipated next year. Our Baytown chemical plant expansion will include a new Vistamaxx unit and a full range, linear alpha olefins unit. It's on track for a 2023 start-up. Our China1 venture captures the advantage of being located in the world's largest growth market. We signed several important agreements to advance the project, including a contract with Sinopec for basic engineering design, procurement, and construction. In the Downstream, we're moving crude to the Wink to Webster pipeline from the Permian Basin and are preparing to ship third party production in the fourth quarter of this year. At Beaumont, process unit modules are on-site and we're ramping up construction activity for start-up in 2023. And our Singapore and Fawley projects are also progressing. However, they are a bit further out in terms of full project restart. Even in the current challenging refining environment, these Downstream projects are still attractive and materially improve the competitiveness of our integrated sites. If these four projects were online at today's margins, they would be contributing more than $1 billion in annual earnings. For example, our Singapore resid project will produce 20,000 barrels a day of high quality lube basestocks that would have added to our strong lubricants result this quarter. Collectively, this world-class Chemical and Downstream project portfolio delivers 30% returns at 10-year average margins. That's more than $4 billion of annual earnings at 10-year average margins and $2 billion at 10-year low margins. We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive Upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 4,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans. Relative to 2019, we've more than double the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling the Delaware Basin 12,500 foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately three times more efficient than in 2019. Another way to think about this is that the eight rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just two years ago. Completions are improving too. Our frac rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%. Our environmental performance also continues to improve. We achieved record-low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantage short cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameters setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns at $35 a barrel or less. This low price resiliency also applies to our deepwater developments in Guyana and Brazil. In Guyana Stabroek block, we've added three new discoveries since the first quarter, including the Whiptail discovery announced this week. The Uaru-2 well encountered 220 feet of high quality oil bearing reservoirs. The Longtail-3 well encountered 230 feet of net pay, and both of these results included newly identified intervals below the zones originally discovered. Resource quantification is ongoing. The Whiptail-1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay and drilling is ongoing at the Whiptail-2 well, which has encountered 167 feet of net pay, both in high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. This additional resource will add to the 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels we discussed at Investor Day, further increasing our confidence in the resource size and quality in the area east of Liza and supporting our view of an ultimate block-wide footprint of seven to 10 developments. The projects in progress remain on schedule, with the expected arrival of the Liza Phase 2 Unity FPSO in Guyanese waters early in the fourth quarter. Payara, the third major development on the block is on track for a 2024 start-up, with topsides construction ongoing. And pending government approval, we're targeting a final investment decision on Yellowtail, our fourth major development later this year, with start-up planned for 2025. Offshore Brazil, we confirmed the final investment decision on the Bacalhau development during the second quarter and expect this 220,000 barrel a day project to start up in 2024. It will deliver more than a 15% rate of return at $50 a barrel. I'll now turn the call back over to Darren to discuss our Low Carbon Solutions business and long-term plans. Well, I did want to pick up on the refining exposure versus some of the others. We do have a - as the largest refiner, I would say refiner, we do have quite a bit exposure to that market. And we talked about in the fourth quarter how historical low that was, and we are seeing some recovery. But due to the jet demand, that's going to take a little bit of time. I did mention in my prepared remarks that these new investments that we are making will help, and the recent ones we have made have helped. The Rotterdam investment has made a couple hundred million dollars this year, and that will continue to help. So we are investing to continue to grow advantage in our - in what is a, difficult right now, fuels value chain. But picking up on the Rotterdam comment, our lubricants business has done quite well over the past couple of years. As a matter of fact, having a record year last year and extremely strong results so far this year. So that is a kind of balance to the fuels, a tough refining fuels market. We - I mentioned the integration of our refining with our chemicals. 75% of our refineries are integrated with chemicals and others are in advantaged market. So we're making sure - we want to make sure that refineries we have going forward are advantaged, and that's what these investments are about, making sure the ones that we think are - have natural advantages, we build on those advantages. And then just in terms of Darren's comment about kind of the physics of refining, we see about almost 3 million barrels a day rationalization over the past year, 18 months. So it's definitely quite a bit above where it has been historically, and we'll just have to see how that plays out, but we are seeing a slow - slower than we hoped recovery refining environment. I would just add to that real quick. If you think about the projects that I talked about, the Chemical and Downstream projects, the Permian and Guyana, very, very good strong returns, industry leading returns from that portfolio. I feel as good about that portfolio as I've ever felt in terms of the projects - project returns we have, Doug. So, I think we're pursuing high returns. Yes. Doug, I think you're getting at the value of the integrated sites and the tight integration between our Chemicals and Downstream organizations, which is absolutely valuable and we can look at those integrated sites and find several hundred million dollars a quarter of value-add, real bottom line value-add with all of these streams moving back and forth. And what we're doing, I think, an even better job of in recent years is looking at the whole portfolio together. And for instance, the Singapore project is a both a Downstream and Chemicals project and you'll see more of those, I think, where we're involving both sides of the business and creating additional value there. So, I think that integration, we view is a real strength going forward, as you think about the whole energy transition and to move forward there, I think it's going to be even more valuable, as we think about molecule management and increase in the value of all those molecules coming into our integrated complexes. Yes, let me, - I'll answer that one, Sam. I think when you're talking about U.S., you talking about the Permian. That's what - from the Upstream perspective, that's what's going to be driving our results there. And I think the slide I showed pretty much demonstrated why that - - you're seeing that bottom line earnings improvement. We're really improving the development efficiency in the Permian, really hitting on all cylinders, getting the sort of efficiencies that we've been targeting for last couple of years, and really hitting those three priorities we talked about, in terms of increasing cash flow and capital efficiency, and really driving those development costs. So as we look going forward in the Permian, we're going to be looking at making sure we hold on to those efficiencies that we've captured, making sure that we - those we sustainable, and then continue to work the technology there, and we see some additional benefits of technology being applied to that program. And as we do that, you get confidence that those benefits are sustainable, we've got the technology built in and we'll be growing that program over time. So, we have the first train of the large infrastructure plant we have up in Poker Lake is full, and we have that connected to our Wink terminal, and our Wink terminal connected all the way into the Gulf Coast. So we have set up that infrastructure now and it's starting to click in terms of bottom line performance. In addition, Roger, to the divestments and the OpEx and efficiency work we're doing, just the profitability of the investments, I've mentioned earlier, there is not any other - Guyana doesn't have a peer out there right now, and we have a large position there and continue to grow it. So it's going to make a big impact over time. So back on the performance products, there are - it's about, think about - that's about a third of our product portfolio in Chemicals, and I showed you that's going to grow at 70% by 2027 and, importantly, grow earnings more, and that's because that 10% to 25% uplift we generally get on our performance products. And I think that was demonstrated, if you look at this quarter. A lot of - almost all the chemical companies benefited from the dynamics we had in the quarter, but you saw the earnings power of our Chemicals company because of this higher margin, because of the technology we bring in those performance products. And the other advantage those have and when you think about all our investments going forward, these investments are focused on generating those performance products, and they're not more capital-intensive, this is catalyst technology. So it's not more capital-intensive and yet, we get - we're having - we're generating a product that gets 10% to 25% more margin. So you can imagine those investments look more profitable as well. So it's a key part of our strategy going forward and we're - we'll just continue to double down on that in terms of the technology improvements and growing those products preferential to the rest of our Chemical portfolio."

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter, starting with the extensive engagement that Board and I had with our shareholders in the months leading up to our Annual Meeting. We received some very explicit feedback that we found valuable, and are incorporating in our plans as we move the company forward. In future, the directors, the management committee, and I look forward to continuing the active shareholder engagement, and discussing the good work going on at the company and the progress we are making on all fronts. Since our Annual Meeting, we welcomed our new directors: Greg Goff, Kaisa Hietala, and Andy Karsner, with a number of discussions that included myself, our Lead Director Ken Frazier, other Board members, and senior managers of the company. In June, we began the new members' onboarding process with in-depth reviews of our businesses and key topics, such as our energy outlook and our approach to the energy transition. While the Board has met virtually on a couple of topics since the Annual Meeting, this week was the first in-person regular meeting of the Board. We had very substantive and productive discussions across both the committees and the full Board. They were informed by the extensive shareholder engagements over the past several months. I'm pleased to say, that without exception, our directors are focused on improving the performance of the company, addressing the challenges faced by our industry, and increasing long-term shareholder value. There is very good alignment on the importance of leveraging the diverse experience and skills of the Board, the important role ExxonMobil will have in the transition helping to lead to the development and deployment of critical technologies, advocating for necessary policy, and making strategically and financially accretive investments, the need to improve transparency and engagement with our shareholders, actively listening and more explicitly addressing concerns, and of course, driving total shareholder return in both the short and long run. While there is still much to do, I think we're working from a very strong foundation. ExxonMobil is proud to be a global leader in the industry. As the energy system evolves with society's needs, we look forward to continuing our role as a leader, helping lead society through the transition, leveraging the deep thinking and analytical rigor of our 20,000 scientists and engineers, and the hard work of all of our people. Another important development in the quarter was the addition of Kathy Mikells to our management committee as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Board, the other members of the management committee, and our entire organization, I want to welcome Kathy and express how excited we are to have her on board. She joins us formally next month and brings significant CFO and Investor Relations experience from her time at Diageo, Xerox, United Airlines, and ADT. In addition to the financial functions, Kathy's portfolio will include Corporate Strategic Planning, Investor Relations, and a number of our global business services like IT and procurement. We look forward to the depth of experience and perspective she will bring. While welcoming Kathy, I'd like to also recognize Andy Swiger's retirement, which was also recently announced. I'd like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the many contributions Andy has made during his 43 years with the company. He has certainly earned his retirement and we all wish him and his wife Sherry the very best. Also of significance in the quarter was the continuing market recovery, which obviously underpins our results. As you will hear, the organization remains very focused on continuing to leverage the changes we've implemented over the last several years and on delivering the plans we've discussed with you in March. As the margin improves, we've maintained a disciplined approach, doing more with less. We remain focused on delivering industry-leading operating performance, continuing to significantly reduce costs, advancing our portfolio of high-return, advantaged projects, executing value-accretive divestments, and rebuilding the strength of our balance sheet. In addition, as a need for climate solutions beyond wind, solar, and electric vehicles grow, we are working to expand our portfolio of strategically and financially accretive low-carbon solutions investments. While still in the early stages, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. I'll come back to this later in the call. At this time, I'll hand it back to Stephen. Thanks, Jack. Let me shift focus now to the wide range of activities we are pursuing to ensure ExxonMobil plays a key role in the energy transition, while continuing to grow shareholder value. You will recall that earlier this year, we established our Low Carbon Solutions business to develop potential carbon capture and storage opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies and progress commercialization of other lower-emissions technologies. We believe that the depth and breadth of our operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution, subsurface expertise, and ability to scale technology gives us a competitive advantage in what is expected to be a fast-growing market for Low Carbon Solutions. We also believe that the time is right, given the developing market for emission reduction credits and growing recognition of the importance of carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels by both governments and investors, all critical for broad-scale commercialization. The new organization is making steady progress in developing a wide range of attractive opportunities weighted initially towards carbon capture and storage. We've provided a few examples here to give you a sense of the opportunities. Next year, we anticipate final investment decisions for a large CCS expansion at our LaBarge facility in Wyoming and a new carbon capture technology pilot associated with the Porthos project in Rotterdam. This quarter, we signed an MOU to explore the development of CO2 infrastructure to help decarbonize the industrial basin in the Normandy region of France, and an MOU to participate in the recently announced Acorn CCS project in Scotland. We are continuing to pursue several Gulf Coast opportunities, including our Houston hub concept, which are all gaining industry and third-party support. In addition to carbon capture and storage, we're advancing a number of options to produce low-emissions biofuels. These include new projects, repurposing existing refinery units, co-processing bio feeds and purchase agreements. These plans would enable the production of more than 40,000 barrels per day of low-emission fuels by 2025. We also recently completed a successful trial to co-process bio feed across our existing refining circuit. Co-processing bio feeds is a key technology that can be rapidly scaled to help society quickly lower emissions, provided the right policies are in place. In addition, during the quarter, we expanded a previous agreement with alternative fuels developer, Global Clean Energy, to annually purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel. This is basically a drop in lower carbon fuel that meets all finished product specs for today's engines. Commercial production is expected to begin next year. In markets where low carbon fuels policies incentivize the development of lower-emission fuels, like California and Canada, scale opportunities exist. We see the potential to leverage our existing facility footprint, proprietary catalyst technology, and decades of experience in processing challenging feed streams to develop attractive low-emission fuels projects with competitive returns. An effectively designed low carbon fuel standard in the U.S. could accelerate significant CO2 reductions in the hard-to-abate transportation segment at a cost much lower than some existing policy. While we advocate for new policies, such as a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard and develop future projects, we continue to lead the industry in developing and deploying new technologies to address another important issue, reducing methane emissions. To that end, we have conducted more than 23,000 leak surveys on more than 5 million components at over 9,500 locations. We are eliminating high-bleed pneumatic devices across our U.S. unconventional production, and participating as a founding member in industry initiatives to improve detection and reduction of methane leaks. ExxonMobil is also the first company to file an application with the EPA to use airplanes equipped with methane detection technology to conduct large flyover inspections, and we're evaluating satellite technology in support of our 2025 reduction plans for both methane intensity and absolute methane emissions. These ongoing efforts to commercialize Low Carbon Solutions and reduce emissions are central to our long-term plan to grow shareholder value. As markets and policies continue to evolve, we will be there playing our part, contributing where we bring the most value. In the near term, as we begin the development of next year's plan, our organization is focused on continuing to deliver industry-leading operating performance, building on last year's record results in safety and reliability, and extending our trend of annual reductions in emissions intensity by accelerating the pace of reductions and establishing more aggressive objectives. This will enable us to reduce our own emissions at a pace faster than what the countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. It will also help accelerate our objective of industry leadership in greenhouse gas performance by the end of the decade. Of course, we remain focused on sustained financial discipline. We are developing plans consistent with our existing commitments to deliver $6 billion of annual structural savings by the end of 2023, manage future capital investments, including new low carbon projects within previously announced CapEx ranges, and restoring the strength of our balance sheet, returning debt to levels consistent with a strong AA rating. As our results demonstrate, we've made good progress in improving our competitiveness, but we're not satisfied. Our plans will focus on driving a further step change. We see a significant opportunity to capture scale and integration benefits from our recent reorganizations, improving efficiency, effectiveness, and growing additional cash flow. To strengthen the earnings and cash flow potential of our assets, our plans will continue to advance high-return, advantaged projects and high-grade our existing assets through accretive divestments. Finally, as I have illustrated, we're stepping up and accelerating efforts to ensure the company plays a meaningful role in the energy transition. Our plans will reflect the continuing development and deployment of needed technologies, and where the appropriate incentives are in place, accretive investments. As we finalize our plans later this year, we'll provide additional updates with a more detailed review at our next Investor Day. Reflecting back on the past half year, we're pleased with the results the organization's hard work has delivered in a recovering market. We've made a lot of progress, as demonstrated by our year-to-date performance, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. We appreciate your participation in today's call. I look forward to answering your questions. Good morning, Phil. Sure. Yes, thanks, Phil. Good to hear from you this morning. Yes, I think the one point I would make in terms of the context to the response is it's fairly early in the process, as I said in my opening comments. We've only had the one meeting with the Board, but I would tell you that meeting was very encouraging. The other point I would make is, actually, the new Board has formed at a very good time with respect to our typical cycle with to - and managing the business. We have just kicked off our corporate plan process that runs through the end of November. And so we, with the new Board, went through the basis of the plan and the objectives that we are setting ourselves. We had an opportunity for a very rich conversation about that and what we need the organization to deliver this year and continuing this year and into next year and the years ahead. We also have a bi-annual strategy process that we have in place, which this year, we are doing in September and the new Board will basically have an opportunity to really dig into and go through the strategies that we've developed with all of our business, including our new business, low-carbon solutions and the broader corporate profile. So I expect as we go through this year to get a lot of good conversations about where the company is going, the opportunities that are ahead of us, and where we want to put our emphasis. I think I would say the fundamental approach that we have taken is very, I'd say, is a pretty good alignment amongst the Board. I think they all recognize that the opportunity for us to take a leadership role in this space and just leveraging the capabilities and advantages we currently have. And so, finding the opportunities that fit well with where we can add the most value is, I think, a very aligned objective amongst the Board, and of course you've heard me talk about that, I mentioned in my opening comments. The broader conversation network this society is now having, governments are now having around the solution sets needed to address the transition, I think, opens the door to a much richer conversation about where ExxonMobil can play and contribute carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, biofuels, other areas potentially where that leverage our strength. So I think we're - the things are lining up very well within the company, and then I would say more externally in the broader environment. With respect to CapEx in the balance sheet, as you mentioned, I think, again, good alignment around the importance of rebuilding the strength of the balance sheet. Everyone recognizes this is a commodity market with some significant cycles and volatility, and making sure that we've got a balance sheet that we can lean on as we move through that volatile environment and manage the downs, as well as the ups, is a really important foundational piece of our strategy, and I think very good alignment on that. And that was reaffirmed in the conversations we had this week with our finance committee and the broader Board. And I think, too, given the improvements we've made around capital efficiencies, the work our global project organization has done to really make sure that we can deliver these projects with - at a very advantaged cost. We're very confident that we can do the things that we want to do, add some additional activities in the low-carbon solutions, and do all of that within the range of CapEx that we've previously communicated. And I think, again, good alignment on that and we will confirm that as we move to plan cycle and have those reviews with the Board later this year. Yes, I would say that the energy transition spending will be embedded in the range that we've laid out. I think though, it's good to keep some perspective in this space. If you think about the comments around the broader opportunity set opening up and a broader recognition of the need for that opportunity sets, I'm referring to carbon capture, hydrogen, that's a very rapidly evolving space. And so, while we've got a really, I think, good portfolio of opportunities, some of them very attractive that the time to transition from the planning and the development of those projects to steel in the ground is going to take some time, we'll be talking about that and the investments that we're planning going forward. And then, of course, the steel in the ground will come with time across the horizon that we typically talk about. And all of that's expected to be within the 20 to 25 range. You bet, Phil. Yes. Thanks, Jon, and good morning. I'll - I'm going to hand it to Jack here to get maybe more specifics, maybe a couple of broader comments that you point, that it is unusual given the consecutive quarters of challenged results in the Downstream. But I would also say, going through the pandemic and losing over half of the jet demand, coming out of the refining circuit is very unusual as well. And I think a very discrete and unique event associated with the global pandemic. So I think that context is really important to keep in mind as you think about our Downstream business and the results. The other point that I would just make with respect to your comment or question is, I think, when you talk about the Downstream and compare across competitors, you've got to recognize the difference in the footprints and the investments in capital assets that we have. I would tell you, as you look across our competitive group, we are much more heavily weighted in refining than some of our competitors. And so, obviously, in an environment where refining margins are structurally down, performance is going to look different. And I think it's really important and certainly to what we focus on is making sure we normalize and understand what aspects are driving the performance. And I would say, our capital structure, the investments that we've made over the years are a really important part of that.  I'd also tell you that what I refer to as the physics of this business is, and you can't stay at these low levels and continue with the level of supply that has historically existed in the Downstream, and you see that today with the shutdowns that are incurring in the industry. And so, while that takes some time, this market will come back into balance and if it's anything like we've seen in the crude, when that economic recovery kicks in, we're going to see supply and demand tighten, I suspect, and I think we'll see a different level of performance with respect to the Downstream and with respect to our peers. But obviously, that will be a function of that balance and when that economic recovery comes back around again. And I'll just make one final point in terms of - we are not relying on just the cycle, we recognize the impact of the cycle, but I can assure you that that Downstream organization is very focused on ensuring that we're pulling as many of value levers as we can in the right way to build sustained and structural improvements that will benefit us obviously in this down cycle, but also in the up cycle. Well, with that, let me turn it over to Jack. I don't know if I left anything, Jack. Sure. And then maybe, just as, I think, very important context to understand what's enabled that change or evolution. And I've talked before, I think, with all of you about the reorganizations and the consolidations and the changes that we've been making in how we run the business. If you look at the senior, the corporate officers in the organization, we've reduced that group by almost 40% over the years in terms of - as we simplify the business, line up the value chains, reduce the overhead, and we were able to make significant simplifications in that structure and then reduce numbers. And that also allows us to concentrate consolidate some of the responsibility. So as we've made those changes with time, we've been able to shape the portfolio of the management committee members and focus them on core areas. And so, we're in a position today where as we've consolidated those responsibilities and focus them, that we're creating a management committee position that's much more aligned today with what would be typical CFO type responsibilities versus in the past where we had much broader number of businesses and therefore, a much broader reporting relationship up into Dallas. So that simplification has enabled our ability to focus and bring these portfolios in line with what would be some more industry standard opportunities, which then led us, and through Board discussions last year, to start thinking about how we can expand the capabilities, the skill sets, the experience on the management committee, and bring in what we think is some relevant experience into a portfolio that's consistent with and shaped with outside industry experience, and the - obviously understanding the industry is going to be an important role with that. I think we've got a pretty capable team and organization that understands that industry very well. It's going to support Kathy with respect to that, as she comes up the learning curve there. But I also think she will bring in a lot of perspective from the outside that's very relevant to the business, along some of those core areas, including procurement and supply chains, and some the other areas of responsibility. So I think there is - that change in our structure and approach to running the business has opened up some nice opportunities and we think bringing in that diversity of thought, experience, and perspective is actually going to benefit, and obviously we'll supplement that with our industry knowledge. I think the mix will be a very powerful combination. I think that's an easy answer to give you, Doug. That has been a primary focus for us for a long, long time, it's certainly when I've been in the job. And as you know from past conversations, the work that we've been doing to reshape the organization, to get more effective at running the business, and then importantly, recapitalizing the business with advantaged assets and supply has been a really important focus, and I think the work that we've done in the past has put us in a very solid position to continue to contribute. I think everybody on the Board is realistic with respect to the challenges facing society with this transition and the work that's going to be required by everybody, ourselves, the rest of industry, governments around the world, other industries, and consumers to make changes on that transition and that will take time. And I think as you look at a lot of the independent third-parties' assessments, they all recognize that this is a challenging area that's going to require a lot of work and expertise in that our industry has an important role to play in helping with that transition, but very importantly, and continuing to meet the need for energy and existing sources of energy. And so, that's the balance that we're trying to strike. And of course, I think one of the - and how that transition evolves and the uncertainty associated with it, obviously everyone could take a different view on that. Our view is the way you help manage some of that uncertainty while you're continuing to meet current demand is to make sure that what you're doing is very advantaged, and on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, which is what we've been focused on, what we've been talking about. So, we think we've got a really good portfolio of high-return projects that are advantaged versus the rest of industry. And so, as time goes on and that uncertainty begins to manifest itself, we think irrespective of how that - the shape of that curve, we're still going to be in a very good position. And so, I think strong recognition within the Board that's the advantage that we've created, and I think commitment to continue to leverage that advantage as we look at opportunities in this space of transition. And the final point I would make to try to reassure you, Doug, is, I think, one of the - if you go back 18 months, I would say, the litmus test for whether or not somebody was committed to helping manage the transition was whether we are investing in solar and wind. Of course, we were concerned about the returns you can generate in that and the value that we bring to that sector. My sense is, over the last 18 months, the broader conversation has quickly evolved and there is this recognition today that more solutions are needed and solutions that fit into our skill set and solutions where we have been working on creating advantage. So, I'm confident that as the need for carbon capture is recognized and projects are being advanced in that space, for biofuels or hydrogen, that the work that we've done and the technology and the fundamentals of carving out advantage there, that we will generate a above industry, above average return for the things that we do in that space. I think, the other point I'd add, Doug is, you're right about is a little artificial to split between refining and chemical, because you've got molecules flowing back and forth, and the only other point I would add to what Jack said was if you think in the area of recycling plastic and some of the work we've been doing for advanced recycling, we're actually using our refinery footprint to recycle plastic into the Chemical business. And so, it is somewhat arbitrary. We try to make sure we understand the drivers behind each of those, but where you choose to draw the line, obviously, is an internal choice, and we're not thinking about it so much along those lines, it's really around how do you maximize the value at the whole. Yes, I'd add, Sam, that we are actually ahead of our plan with respect to the improvements and the work that we did early on with the delineation, the infrastructure we put aboveground, all of that, spending at the front end to position ourselves as we move forward. And if you recall, the talk we had about technology and what we wanted to do there, that's all coming to fruition. And then, I think as we move forward, it's how we make sure we're continuing to leverage that effectively, and that's an ongoing area of focus and discussion because we see good value there, good opportunities, but we're going to make sure that we hang on to the gains and continue to leverage that effectively. Yes. Sam, I'd tell you that the emphasis has not changed and I think the way you've characterize it isn't exactly how we were thinking about. Our drive for divestments and asset sales is really around focusing on concentrating our assets in the areas where we have advantage, where we can leverage some of our organizational capabilities, and so it's really around focusing the portfolio and highgrading it, and that continues to be a really important part of our work there. And so, that whole divestment discussion that we've had in the past continues to hold. You'll recall, last year we said, given the market dynamics and the impact of the pandemic that that was probably going to slow the pace of those. It certainly didn't slow our activities, and I would tell you today, our activities haven't slowed, and what we're seeing now with additional buyer interest, my expectation is, as we move forward, if we can find deal space there, we'll continue to continue to see those things play themselves out. No, I would say - I think, actually, we started a different approach last year that was maybe overwhelmed or mixed up with some of proxy action that was going on, but we had committed last year to start a more of a continuum and discussions and talking and put less emphasis on the Investor Day big bang and more, what I would say is, continuing dialog about where the business is going. And so, after we had our plan endorsed by the Board, we put out a press release that gave some highlights. I talked about it in our fourth quarter call and then rolled into the Investor Day. I would tell you that continues to be the new approach that we want to take. I think that was reinforced by a lot of the discussions that we had with shareholders and this desire for continued transparency and more engaged dialogues. And so, we're committed to continuing to do that. My expectation was, as the Board goes through its deliberations, as our organization develop plans and options, that you're going to see a more of a continuum in the discussion and the evolution of those plans going forward. I think again, I'd just reiterate, if you look at the foundational elements of our strategy, which is really leveraging the strengths of our corporation, the technology, the ability to scale, our projects organization, the capital capabilities that we have, a lot of those fundamentals, those have not changed. And the work that we are doing in technology to advance as what we believe are going to be important solutions to adjust to address transition - the transition, that hasn't changed. In fact, what I would tell you is, there's probably even more appetite around that. So if you think about the fundamentals, what we can bring to the equation, and then what's needed, given that those remain fairly constant, I think, I wouldn't see huge shifts in the strategy, but you may see accelerations, additional emphasis in areas, and continuing to leverage on those cores and how they manifest themselves. We're committed to leveraging the new perspectives and experience and capabilities we've brought into the Board. That was part - in part, some of the reasons that we made some of those changes. And so, we've got a really good experience set today, and how we leverage that in our thinking and what opportunities that develops, I think we'll come out of our strategy and plan discussions and we'll talk to you all about that as that thinking evolves and gets translated into plans and actions. Well, I would - I guess, a couple of thoughts with respect to that - to your question, Roger. First of all, I'd link back to the comment that we had in the Downstream, not all volumes are created equal. And so, when you talk about Upstream and volumes, I think you really got to step back and look at the mix of those volumes and the resource types that you're in and the location of the resources. And so, I think again, while it ultimately is a function of what you deliver and so, no excuses there, it's just understanding that and what leverage you have to affect it, which ties into - so I think you start with your portfolio and how do you feel about that and where are the opportunities to improve it are, which comes back to the capital we've been investing in the Upstream with the view that we got to - we're focused on bringing in more profitable, higher-value barrels and the divestment work that we've been doing, which we just touched on, which is taking the areas, the volumes in some of the projects were an asset that you feel like it may have a higher value to others and shifting those out of our portfolio. So that highgrading of the portfolio and the resulting change in the mix of our barrels and volumes, I think, is a very important part of the equation and one of the things we've been very focused on. I would just tell you, that is a big driver as you look across the competitive landscape, and one of the reasons why we've been so focused on that space. And then above and beyond that, when you think about the organizational construct, how you're managing that, the focus that you've got, end-to-end focus along that value chain, that has been a very big change that we've made in the organization. I think we're seeing the benefits of that today in how we're running Upstream, and my expectation is we'll continue to see additional benefits manifest themselves with time. And that's with respect to effectiveness and responding more effectively to market signals and delivering value there, and it's also a function of efficiency in terms of additional cost reduction. So, I would expect to continue to see an evolving, improving business in the Upstream, just as I expect to see that in our Chemical and Downstream business. Operator, we probably have time for one more question. I appreciate your questions, Jason, and I'm going to - I will let Jack talk to the chemical piece of your question and I'll address the capital allocation. I will though, just on the Chemical one, we do look at that in terms of the product emissions and we do recognize the opportunity that Chemicals brings in terms of helping society achieve that lower emissions. That is something that we talk a lot about. We've - gas is another one I would add, with respect to the alternatives that are out there today. So it is an important part of the equation that we think about and continue to work. And I'm less focused on how you take credit for it, more focused on making sure that it happens. But I'll let Jack spend some more time on that. With respect to your capital allocation and the dividends, I would tell you that the foundational elements of our capital allocation remain unchanged with respect to making sure that we're finding high-return, industry-advantaged investments, because that underpins basically everything else we do for the long term. We are a capital-intensive industry and so you better be making sure that you've got a good program of investments in capital, particularly in the depletion side of the business. And maintaining the balance sheet has always been an important part we do down heavily and that advantage paid off last year, and we're going to rebuild that. So as you said, that's part of our strategy. And then shareholders distributions have been the third leg of that stool and an important aspect. And so with respect to that question you heard, we think we've got a good plan on our investments and the range that we'll be investing going forward. We're making good progress on the debt, particularly given the higher-price environments than anticipated. And then on distribution, it is part of the conversation and discussions we've had. I would tell you, we have always felt a very strong commitment to our base shareholders to deliver on a dividend, a reliable and growing dividend, and that continues to be part of the conversation, and I would say the Board would like to continue to deliver on that commitment. And so we're continued - we're committed to that, a reliable dividend and one that grows with time. And obviously, if we're maintaining capital in the range that we won't - we get our debt back to levels that assure us the ability to ride through the cycles, and we've got a manageable dividend that's reliable and growing, recognizing anytime you raised the dividend, that brings of the burden up. We want to - we're going to continue to do that, but at the same time there, we want to manage that total outlay in the dividend. And so, buybacks and other distributions become part of that equation, particularly when to redistribute cash. So that's all on the table, and I think as we move through this year, and depending on where price is at, those opportunities will grow in relevance. And with a capital program that's pretty well defined and a debt that we - objective that's pretty well defined, you've got this opportunity on the distributions that I think the Board will continue to evaluate as we go forward."

And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in Exxon Mobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. I\u2019m pleased to welcome Darren Woods, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Exxon Mobil, who will be joining me for the call today. After I cover the quarterly financial and operational results, Darren will provide his perspective on the quarterly results and how we are positioned for 2021. Following those remarks, Darren and I\u2019ll be happy to address any questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and to the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I\u2019ll now highlight development since the fourth quarter of 2020 on the next slide. Across all three businesses, improved results reflect encouraging signs of the recovery from the pandemic as vaccinations are administered and some restrictions are lifted. In the Upstream, liquids and gas realizations improved significantly versus the fourth quarter. Production was higher driven by lower government mandated curtailments and higher seasonal gas demand in Europe. And as part of ongoing efforts to high-grade our portfolio, we announced the sale of most of our non-operated assets in the United Kingdom, Central and Northern North Sea. The sale price of more than $1 billion is subject to closing adjustments and has potential upside of approximately $300 million in contingent payments, based on commodity prices. In the Downstream, we continue to realize improvements in the North America refining margins. However, in Europe margins remained impacted by COVID lockdowns. While we have seen improved demand for gasoline and diesel, jet demand remains impacted by global travel restrictions. During the winter storm our Texas refineries were able to provide power to more than 200,000 homes through our cogeneration facilities. During the quarter, we announced the intent to convert both, the Altona Australia refinery and the Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals, as overall industry rationalization continues. In the quarter, there were approximately 500,000 barrels of industry rationalizations announced. In Chemical, tight industry supply, shipping constraints and strong demand resulted in global average margins improving to the top of the historic 10-year range. We were able to capture the benefits of these improved margins with strong reliability and the rapid recovery of our operations from the winter storm. In addition, we have continued to deliver further cost efficiencies. Across the corporation, improved prices and margins in addition to cost reduction initiatives, resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of more than $4 billion in the quarter. In February, operations across all three businesses were impacted by winter storm Uri. Repairs were completed and operations fully recovered by the end of the quarter. Finally, we established a low carbon solutions business to commercialize and deploy our portfolio of emission reduction technologies. The new business will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net zero emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Let\u2019s move to slide 4, for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative to the prior quarter. First quarter earnings were $2.7 billion, including $31 million of identified items related to severance. Earnings, excluding identified items were $2.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion versus the fourth quarter. Despite the impacts of the winter storm, which you will see caught out in the table, earnings improved across all businesses, primarily due to higher prices and margins. There was a $300 million benefit in the quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives, for which the physical trading strategy has not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings impact of these trading strategies, when they close in the future. Also, we have continued to benefit from structurally lower operating costs, in all of our business lines. On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items. Upstream earnings improved by over $1.8 billion in the first quarter with liquid realizations increasing by 42%, and gas realizations by 33%. The earnings change associated with volumes was negatively impacted by mix and timing effects, which offset higher production versus the prior quarter. Lower expenses including structural efficiencies, contributed approximately $170 million in earnings. On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of Upstream volumes. Upstream volumes increased by an average of approximately 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Gas volumes were 12% higher, mainly due to seasonal gas demand and lower scheduled maintenance. Liquids were down 3% with winter storm impacts and higher maintenance. Lower entitlements due to higher prices, negatively impacted volumes by approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Reduced government mandated curtailments increased volumes by about 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day and gas demand was higher by approximately 70,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, mainly due to seasonal gas demand in Europe. Guyana and Permian production were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2020. However, compared to the first quarter of 2020, Permian production was approximately 20% higher excluding the impact of the winter storm, an average of around 395,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the quarter. Guyana production increased by approximately 70% or 19,000 barrels per day over the same period. Moving to slide 7. Downstream earnings improved by over $300 million in the first quarter, despite the impacts of the winter storm. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $500 million as North America product demand continued to rebound. There was almost $400 million of earnings benefits from the expense reductions in the quarter, including structural efficiencies related to maintenance, optimization, logistics, and marketing. We also had unfavorable foreign exchange effects in the absence of prior period inventory impacts during the quarter. A reserve for announced terminal conversion is included in the other factor. Moving to Chemical on slide 8. Chemical had a strong quarter, delivering over $1.4 billion in earnings, more than a $700 million improvement versus the fourth quarter. Margins improved by $500 million, driven by tightly supplied polyethylene and polypropylene markets, impacted by the winter storm where at its peak, approximately 75% of U.S. polyethylene capacity was offline. Performance products demand into packaging and durable goods was resilient through the period. During the quarter, we had strong reliability, which positioned us to capture the improved margins. We continued to deliver cost reductions through turnaround and maintenance scope optimizations, contributing an additional $150 million to earnings in the quarter. On the next slide, I will summarize results versus the first quarter of 2020. Versus the first quarter of 2020, earnings increased by around $500 million. There was a total price margin improvement of about $1.3 billion, driven by higher Upstream prices and Chemical margins as the market recovered. This is partially offset by lower Downstream margins, but excludes the mark-to-market impact of unsettled derivatives, which was driven by the absence of a benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Cost reduction efforts, including structural efficiencies and maintenance, supply chain optimization, and the announced workforce reductions contributed over $1 billion of improvement to earnings. Moving to slide 10, I\u2019ll provide further details on our cost savings and CapEx reductions. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $9.2 billion in the first quarter, $1 billion lower than the same quarter last year. This reflects the significant structural improvements achieved in 2020 from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, on track towards the lower end of our full-year guidance. This reduction of over $4 billion versus the first quarter of 2020 was enabled by the flexibility of our short cycle unconventional assets and by our ability to pace Downstream and Chemical projects, consistent with market conditions. As Dan will cover later, we were able to do this, while preserving the long-term value of the opportunities. Moving on to a summary of cash flow on a slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this was up $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting our ability to capture higher prices and margins, and the results of our cost reduction efforts. We reduced debt by more than $4 billion, consistent with our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 12, I will cover a few key considerations for the second quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to be in line with the first quarter. We expect lower volumes with seasonal gas demand and higher maintenance. The sale of the UK Central and Northern North Sea assets is expected to close near midyear, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement in line with third-party forecasts with jet continuing to recover at a slower pace than gasoline and diesel. Higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds are planned for the quarter. In Chemical, we anticipate a tight supply and demand balance with ongoing industry maintenance impacting global supply, and we have higher planned turnarounds in the quarter. Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be about $600 million. And we expect to further reduce debt if price and margins remain at current levels. With that, I will now turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s good to be back with you. This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action was clear. We made some tough decisions and committed to bold actions. In our fourth quarter call, I reviewed our results, the success we had in meeting, and in some cases, beating those bold commitments. We made a lot of progress over the course of a challenging year. The positive results we announced today reflect not only last year\u2019s work, the work we started years ago, work that has positioned us to take advantage of market improvements. Today, I joined the call to put that work in context. I\u2019ll discuss the foundation for success that we\u2019ve laid and how it will manifest in growing shareholder value, value that will further materialize as markets continue to recover and as the world transitions to a lower carbon future. Our successful response to the unprecedented challenges of 2020 has its roots in two critical initiatives started years earlier. The first was our focus on developing an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investments to recapitalize our businesses and increase capacity to generate earnings and cash. Prioritized investments in these opportunities last year are paying dividends this year and will continue to well into the future. The second initiative, which began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, was a significant restructuring of our businesses, reducing functional silos, organizing along value chains and consolidating competencies. This greatly reduced organizational complexity, interfaces and overhead. We provided a clearer line of sight to the market, increased ownership for earnings at all levels and improved the speed and quality of decision-making across the corporation. Importantly, it helped our people better relate their work to our bottom line results. We see the benefits of this in the first quarter results. Through structural changes, we\u2019ve permanently reduced operating expenses, capturing $3 billion in 2020 versus 2019, with further efficiencies in the first quarter and more expected through the year. In total, we expect to achieve $6 billion of annual savings by 2023 versus 2019. At the same time, we reduced emissions, operated safely and delivered best-ever reliability performance. Our focus in this area also paid off in the first quarter with a well-managed response to the Texas ice storms, minimizing impacts and speeding recovery. Throughout 2020, we worked to strike a difficult balance, dramatically reducing near-term spend without compromising longer term value. We used our balance sheet to maintain spending that was critical to shareholder value, including sustaining a strong dividend. We also maintained our work in advancing low-carbon technologies and developing projects with the potential to significantly reduce society\u2019s emissions. This work is crucial in underpinning our long-term future and in continuing to grow shareholder value. It also facilitated the launch of our Low Carbon Solutions business in the first quarter, a strategic business that we expect to grow with significant investments as we advance low-carbon technologies. We prioritized maintenance activities, ensuring essential work was completed last year and the remainder early this year, ahead of the anticipated demand recovery. We reduced 2020 CapEx by 30% versus our original plan. We did this by pacing project execution and leveraging our global projects organization to prioritize and optimally slow projects. We are continuing to pace projects to rebuild the balance sheet and pay down debt. In the first quarter, we made significant progress. Investments are in line with our outlook for the year of $16 billion to $19 billion, and debt was reduced by over $4 billion. Throughout this time, we\u2019ve never lost sight of the long-term fundamentals of our business. We knew economies will recover, populations and living standards would continue to grow, ultimately driving demand for our products and an industry recovery. Today, we are beginning to see this and are well positioned. Thanks to our efforts over the last few years, we are a stronger company with an improving outlook. You will, of course, recognize this chart, which we\u2019ve used since our third quarter call last year. At that time, we made the point that the pandemic had driven industry prices and margins to unsustainably low levels. And while hard to predict when that margins and prices would rebound. And today, we\u2019re seeing this rebound, which is happening faster than we thought and for some sectors, rising to higher levels than anticipated. The Upstream is back within the 10-year range with Brent prices improving by roughly 40% since the fourth quarter and natural gas up by about a third. In the Downstream, margins remain well below the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins, on the other hand, has swung from the bottom to the top. One thing is for sure, these margins and prices will continue to move. We\u2019ve based our plans on a conservative outlook and are positioning our businesses to be successful at or below the bottom of these ranges. At the same time, we\u2019re making sure that when the upswings come, we take advantage, which is why we went to great efforts to preserve our portfolio of investments while building in flexibility. It\u2019s also why we test each investment against a wide range of market scenarios and insist on structural advantages to generate leading returns at any price. Today\u2019s portfolio of opportunities is the best we\u2019ve seen in 20 years. 90% of our Upstream investments and resource additions over the next five years, including Guyana, Brazil and the Permian, generate 10% returns at $35 a barrel or less. In Guyana, we\u2019re continuing to progress Liza Phase 2. Payara is on schedule, and we\u2019ve begun planning for the next development, Yellowtail. The Bacalhau development offshore Brazil is advancing toward a final investment decision, and we\u2019re delivering greater efficiencies in the Permian, efficiencies that are driving down costs for drilling and completions while improving recovery rates and growing production. Based on these improvements and without additional capital, we\u2019ve increased our 2021 outlook to between 410,000 and 430,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day. The Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is ahead of schedule with a projected start-up in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the project for about 25% less than the average cost of a Gulf Coast steam cracker. This facility is a key development in our plan to grow sales of high-value performance products by 60% through 2027. As we focused our activities on the highest value investments, we also worked hard to preserve the value of the projects we were pacing. As I mentioned, our global projects organization played a critical role in this, working closely with contractors, partners and resource owners to find efficiencies and reduce spend. Every project was reevaluated and tested against conditions informed by the pandemic, while all remained attractive and in our portfolio, the highest-value opportunities were given priority. Pace projects were evaluated for optimum breakpoints, with work continuing until these were reached. You can see this in the photos, which show the project status at the time the pandemic hit and when they were paused. Working closely with contractors, our team successfully offset deferral costs with efficiencies and market savings and preserved portfolio returns of greater than 30%. The CapEx outlook we provided incorporates resumptions of these project activities over time as the market recovers and we make progress deleveraging. Striking the right balance in our capital allocation priority was critical, as demonstrated by the price and margin chart. This was particularly true in the depleting businesses of the Upstream. The value of the choices made here are shown in the next couple of slides. We are excited by the results of the significant work and strategic investments made since 2017 to reshape our portfolio into one of the most price competitive in the industry, generating strong returns in a variety of price environments. Chart on the left, similar to the one used on Investor Day, shows the Brent price needed for upstream resource investments made in 2020 to generate a 10% return. As you can see, more than 90% of the investments require Brent price at or below $35 a barrel. On the right are the anticipated cash flows resulting from the projects retained in our 2020 investment program for this year and in 2025. As you can see, the investments we made in 2020 are making a significant contribution now and into the future. This is particularly true in the Permian, shown on the next slide. Last year, we reduced Permian CapEx by about 35%, but maintained a level of investment to support our technology efforts and drive improvements. This work contributed to an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2020 versus 2019 and an increase of 60,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year. This work also drove significant progress across a number of variables, as shown on the left. Higher well productivity and lower costs resulted in positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year, which will continue through 2021. In addition, with the Poker Lake processing facility online and pipelines commissioned, we can ensure production is delivered to the highest value outlet at the lowest cost. Hopefully, these last two charts help illustrate the importance of striking the right capital allocation balance to preserve longer term value, particularly in trying times. Our first quarter results helped demonstrate this. We maintained our strong dividend, generated strong cash flow, delivered further cost reductions, remained flexible and disciplined in our capital spend, delivered excellent safety, environmental and reliability performance, and advanced solutions for a lower carbon economy. As we progress through this year, we\u2019ll maintain our capital priorities and a balanced approach. Our planned capital range for 2021 remains $16 billion to $19 billion with the outyears at $20 billion to $25 billion. If markets take an unexpected downturn, we have the flexibility to adjust. If margins and prices stay higher than planned, we\u2019ll deleverage faster, rebuilding the balance sheet. As the price and margin chart I reviewed earlier demonstrated, things can change quickly. A strong balance sheet remains a critical advantage in a capital-intensive commodity business. It also provides an important foundation for managing an uncertain future and the transition of the energy sector, which I\u2019ll turn to next. I\u2019ll start by restating our strategy and addressing the risks of climate change and the energy transition, a strategy based on four pillars we\u2019ve had in place for many years. It begins with mitigating emissions in our operations, which has been a focus for decades. Versus 2016, 2020 GHG emissions are down 11%. We met the methane and flaring reductions we committed to in 2018 and established aggressive emission reduction plans through 2025, putting us on a trajectory consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are committed to providing product to help customers reduce their emissions. Across the globe, we\u2019re helping economies decarbonize by providing natural gas for power generation, reducing emissions by more than a half versus coal. Our chemical products reduced vehicle weight, lowering transportation emissions and preserve shelf life of food, reducing waste and agricultural emissions. Our fuels and lube products, improve efficiency, also helping to reduce emissions. We\u2019re also proactively engaging on climate policy. We\u2019ve demonstrated this through our support for the Paris agreement and economy-wide price on carbon, consistent regulations to reduce methane emissions and frameworks to support investment in carbon abatement. And finally, we\u2019re focusing on developing and deploying scalable technology solutions that are needed to reduce emissions on a larger scale. We\u2019re focusing on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors of power generation, heavy-duty transport and industrial manufacturing. We\u2019ve launched our Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize technologies and accelerate large-scale emission reductions in these areas. Since 2000, we\u2019ve invested more than $10 billion in lower emissions technologies and have plans to invest an additional $3 billion by 2025. Our initial emphasis is on carbon capture and storage, or CCS, a technology critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. I expect the magnitude of investments to grow as we work with industry, governments and communities to advance attractive project concepts that also generate shareholder value. Having said this, it\u2019s important to keep the current level of planned investments in perspective. When you compare the investment levels of our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses with the size of their markets, our spend represents less than 0.3% of the total addressable market. We do the same for our planned investments in CCS. They represent over 3% of the total addressable market, more than 10 times the level of investments in our traditional businesses. We think this is reasonable given the early stage of this market\u2019s development. With our industry-leading position and decades of experience in CCS, we\u2019re well positioned to successfully compete in this growing and potentially large future market. As we tried to illustrate in this chart, today, we\u2019re the global leader in capturing CO2. In fact, we\u2019ve captured more anthropogenic CO2 than anyone in the world. We have an interest in over one-fifth of the world\u2019s CCS capacity and significant holdings in CO2 pipelines. Grass roots, large-scale CCS projects leverage our competitive advantages in technology and project management as well as decades of experience bringing new ventures to market. This is important, particularly for this potentially fast-growing large market, and it\u2019s why we launched the Low Carbon Solutions business, which is evaluating and advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities around the world. Last week, we introduced the concept of a multi-industry CCS hub to capture and store CO2 emissions from the heavy industry around the Houston Ship Channel. We think a carbon capture innovation zone, similar to an enterprise zone where incentives and policies are designed to encourage economic growth, is a smart way to advance this idea. We help bring together government incentives and private sector investments along with new policies and regulations that would encourage innovation. Houston is an ideal location for a major project. The plants along the heavily industrialized ship channel represents some of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. They\u2019re also relatively close together, providing project scale and reducing unit costs. Houston\u2019s proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also provides direct access to suitable storage locations. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the geology beneath the seafloor has the capacity to safely store all the CO2 that the entire country currently produces for the next 100 years. As currently envisioned, the project could capture 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. This would put Houston well on its way to reaching its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. This concept will need support from many different parties, both private and public. Regulatory and legal support at all levels of government will be crucial for establishing incentives and attracting investment. The federal government already provides some carbon reduction incentives such as tax credits for electric vehicle, wind, solar and CCS. Enhancing these credits or establishing a market price on carbon emissions, combined with appropriate rules and oversight, would accelerate solutions. We\u2019ve long talked about the importance of innovation. This multiuser hub concept is just one example of how we\u2019re looking to take on large, complex challenges and find solutions to help meet society\u2019s demand for a lower carbon future. This can play an important role in positioning the Company to deliver long-term shareholder value. The first quarter results clearly show that we\u2019re on the right path and well positioned for a continued market recovery. We will remain flexible while focusing on disciplined investing in high-return, competitively advantaged projects. This will provide the foundation for strong cash flows, a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet. We will remain relentless in structurally reducing costs by fully leveraging our new organization. We will continue to deliver industry-leading safety and reliability performance, meet our emission reduction plans, and help society transition to a lower carbon future, and we will do all this to grow shareholder value. I look forward to taking your questions.\nStephen Littleton: Thank you for your comments, Darren. We\u2019ll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Woods and Mr. Littleton. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results. Good to see some of the cost reductions and growth investments really paying dividends here in 2021. My first question is actually building on some of the last points you were making, Darren, on carbon reduction efforts in the Houston hub specifically. I think it\u2019s a very interesting concept, has a lot of potential. I was wondering if you could elaborate from a policy standpoint, what types of things are needed or policies need to be put in place in order to bring these types of projects to fruition. And then, are there other parts within your portfolio globally where there are already policies in place to make these types of investments viable today?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Thanks, Devin. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we\u2019re looking at doing in this space and reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn\u2019t have clear market drivers. And the governments have demonstrated, in other industries when they\u2019re looking to reduce CO2, they provide stimulus to catalyze advancements of new technology. I think the big difference with what we\u2019re talking about here versus some of the other initiatives that the government has supported is there\u2019s not an existing business or market that provides some level of financial incentives. And so, I think the work that has to be done with the government is aligning on the incentives to drive investments across industries to drop and lower the CO2 price. And we think we can do that and do it at a very attractive rate of return at much lower prices than what the government is currently spending to reduce CO2. If you recall from our Investor Day, we had a chart that showed the costs associated with reducing CO2 through carbon capture and compare that to the cost of CO2 removal through other mechanisms. And we have the opportunity to reduce significant levels of CO2 at a much lower cost than current policy. So, that will be an important part, policy to drive incentives. You\u2019ll need policies and frameworks to support the legal regime for storing CO2. We\u2019ll need permitting to put the facilities in place and run the pipelines. You\u2019ll need some frameworks to support the storage and access to the storage offshore. So, there\u2019s a number of areas that will need to be addressed. And then, obviously, we\u2019ll have to work with the industries involved here and work with them collaboratively to bring the CO2 in, and then also, of course, the communities that we\u2019ll be operating in. We\u2019ll have to work with them. And we think that\u2019s all possible. If you think about the work we do around the world in establishing new ventures, bringing new ventures to market, this is very consistent with our experience base. And I\u2019ll just point to Guyana, where essentially where we have started from grassroots, a brand-new oil and gas industry, working very closely with the government and community there in Guyana. So we\u2019ve got experience in this space. We\u2019ve got experience working in collaboration with other industry partners and experience working with governments to bring these complicated things together at scale and make a significant contribution.\nDevin McDermott: Great. That makes a lot of sense. And my second question is just on the cost reductions. So, you realized $3 billion last year. And if you look at the slide deck in the first quarter ray, you\u2019re down about $1 billion in the first quarter of \u201821 versus the first quarter of last year. So, annualized, a $4 billion reduction so far. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect the reductions to increase and move through this year, and I know you have a longer term target of $3 billion of incremental cost reduction. My question specifically though is, how should we think about the cadence of these cost reductions flowing through for the balance of this year and over the next few years. And as you\u2019ve embarked on these restructuring initiatives, have you found opportunities that might allow you to exceed this target over time, the $6 billion total target?\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. I guess, let me just maybe start with where you ended and with respect to the $6 billion. And I just want to make the point, it\u2019s not a target. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve laid out and asked the organization to figure out how to achieve it. It\u2019s actually part of the plans that we\u2019ve built. And so, the organization has a clear line of sight to the reductions, and there\u2019s -- they\u2019ve built that into their plans. We\u2019re stewarding the businesses every month versus those plans. And so, we feel very good about what we\u2019ve identified and the work that we have going on. And the first quarter demonstrates that we are continuing to achieve the reductions. I would not take the first quarter results and try to multiply those and move them out. I think you\u2019re going to see things move with activities as you go through the year. But, my expectation is, the theme that you\u2019re seeing with these reductions will continue, and we will -- we\u2019re on track to deliver the $6 billion by the end of 2023. I guess, the final point I would make here, Devin, is my expectation, as we\u2019ve been working our way through this and translating those plans into action is we\u2019ll find more opportunities. I would expect it will beat the target of the plans that we put out there. We\u2019ve got work going on now that kind of goes across the corporation. I mentioned the fact that we have structurally change the way we run our businesses. That change has now aligned each of the sectors in terms of how we\u2019re organized and a lot of the processes that were used to execute the business. That gives us an opportunity to take advantage of this consistency and processes and execution and find additional efficiencies and synergies, and that work\u2019s underway, which we\u2019ll continue to develop as we move through this year, and I suspect we\u2019ll have more to talk about it as we finalize our plans for the year at the back end and into the next year\u2019s Investor Day. So, I\u2019m real optimistic that the groundwork that we\u2019ve laid since 2017 and looking at the businesses and how we reorganize are paying dividends today and are going to continue to pay dividends, well into the future.\nStephen Littleton: I guess, Darren, if I can add, the other piece that we\u2019re seeing, Devin, is as we\u2019ve invested in technology, that\u2019s starting to see its benefits in terms of reducing our overall cost structure with the technology and IT investments.\nOperator: Next question will be from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: I hope you can hear me okay, because I think the storms here in Houston are affecting my connection a little bit. So, apologies\u2026\nDarren Woods: You\u2019re loud and clear, Roger.\nRoger Read: Great. Darren, great performance this quarter from the Chemicals business. I know a lot of issues with storms, everything like that, some crazy moves in the pricing. I was just curious, do you think the Chemicals business is, in a sense, hit a reset here and this -- I don\u2019t want to say Q1 performance continues, but a much better than, let\u2019s say, the last six to eight quarters in this business. And as you think about that, is it mostly demand? Is it a pricing performance? We hear a lot of talk about inflation across the industry -- across industries, I should say. So, I\u2019m just curious what all we should think about with Chemicals.\nDarren Woods: Sure. And thanks for the question, Roger. I would say, the first quarter performance in Chemicals, first and foremost, reflects that organization\u2019s focus on running their operations reliably and safely, a lot of hard work to make sure that the integrity of the operations and the reliability of those operations are maintained. And we did a lot of work over last year. And I think moving into the first quarter. That focus has really helped our manufacturing facilities deal with the freeze and recover very rapidly from that. So, real proud of that effort. It wasn\u2019t easy, but that organization really delivered. I think the other thing it demonstrates is the focus that they\u2019ve had for several years on growing their high-performance products. And we knew that the demand for chemicals has been consistently strong and has been growing in excess of GDP growth around the world. And that fundamental, we think, will continue for some time since chemical plays such an important role in people\u2019s modern life and the convenience of the modern life and actually the critical importance of some of the products that chemicals make. Of course, the -- so the big challenge there though is as supply comes on in fairly large chunks, with different plants, that tends to result in supply and demand imbalances and lower margins. And of course, we saw that last year. And frankly, going into this year, we kind of anticipated a lot of capacity coming on, which would squeeze the margins and make for a challenging year. I think what we\u2019ve seen is with the impact of last year and the pullback in spending that was required due to the pandemic and then probably exacerbated by the Texas storm here with all the capacity in the Gulf Coast area, the supply has gotten pretty tight as demand has continued to move. And then, with the economic recovery and the rebound that we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s put some more demand into the system. So, it\u2019s -- I think the first quarter reflects good operations, good performance, good focus on growing our high-performance products and some really helpful market conditions from a supply and demand standpoint. My expectation as you move forward is we\u2019ll see some of that supply come back on, a recovery from the ice storms and some of this new capacity that was deferred will start to make its way back into the market, and that will help probably ease some of the tightness. But, our expectation is, we\u2019ll continue to see a pretty good market here this year for the Chemical business.\nRoger Read: And then, my other question, balance sheet. Obviously, you made the debt repayments this quarter commentary about excess cash will go towards debt repayments. Don\u2019t expect you to fix the balance sheet in one year, but kind of reaffirm for us where you\u2019d like to take the balance sheet over time, above and beyond just understanding you want to sustain the dividend, but like what\u2019s the right way to think about whether it\u2019s debt-to-EBITDA or debt-to-cap number, something along those lines?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Well, as we\u2019ve said, with our capital allocation priorities, there is three legs to the stool, so to speak. And, obviously, really important for the foundation of success for the future is investing in the right projects, particularly in the Upstream with the depletion nature of that business. We\u2019ve got to find industry advantaged investment opportunities. In the Chemical business, making sure that we\u2019re investing in the high-performance products that meet the demand, the growing demand that we\u2019re seeing around the world. And in the Downstream, investing in strategic sites to high-grade their production and make sure that the production is in line with the demand in the marketplace. And so, that\u2019s critical element, and that\u2019s something that we stay focused on as we went through 2020, making sure that we didn\u2019t compromise the value of that particular capital allocation priority. The dividend obviously a critical part of that, and sustaining that dividend was a commitment that we\u2019ve had for a long, long time, and we stay committed to that. So that\u2019s obviously going to be an important factor going forward. And then, the balance sheet is making sure that we maintain the capacity to ride through the commodity cycles and not compromise those first two priorities that I talked to you about. And that\u2019s what we did in 2020. Obviously, the pandemic was a very unusual year, much deeper than any typical commodity cycle. So, we had to lean harder on that than we normally would. We\u2019re very committed now to making sure that we rebuild that in anticipation of future commodity cycles. I think what we said during the Investor Day was we\u2019re going to shoot for something between 20% and 25% debt to capital. And that still feels like a reasonable place to be, and we\u2019ll work our way towards that as we go through this year and probably into next, obviously, depending upon the price and margin environment that we find ourselves in.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: The first question that we have is on the balance sheet, and we\u2019re just maybe looking for a little update here. Based on what you\u2019re seeing so far on the macro and with your own operations, is there any update to the $45 to $50 breakeven for 2021 to cover CapEx to maintain the dividend? I know Chem\u2019s margins, they\u2019ve dramatically improved; Downstream margins, they\u2019re still kind of below the 10-year band.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And so, if you remember how we did that breakeven as we made some assumptions about kind of low end of Chemical and Downstream margins and then average Chemical margin and Downstream margins going forward. And recognizing that that wasn\u2019t necessarily forecast, it was just one way to characterize it. And the important point we were trying to make, and I think we\u2019ve made historically, is as you look at our breakeven, you can\u2019t just focus on the crude price that we\u2019ve got significant businesses in both the Downstream and Chemicals that obviously impact that. I would say, we haven\u2019t tried to update that number. I think what we tried to do with the Investor Day is just give you and others the confidence that with our portfolio and the plans that we had, we were robust to a very wide range of prices. The fact that the Chemical margins are as good as they are today says that that breakeven has come down. But frankly, we\u2019re not really sharpening our pencils anymore on that because we\u2019ve got a plan, and the foundations of that plant haven\u2019t changed. I just think we feel better about the position that we\u2019re in today, given where the market is at. We\u2019ll take advantage of it while it\u2019s here. But, I would tell you that our plans aren\u2019t based on those sustaining themselves. And as I said, we will pay down the debt and deleverage faster, given the help that we\u2019re getting from the market right now. That\u2019s just put us in a stronger position for the future.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. My second question is on CapEx. So, for the \u201821 budget, Q1 was in line with your plan. You reiterated the $16 billion to $19 billion for the year. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it somewhere, but are you still targeting the lower half of the range, given what you\u2019re seeing on the macro performance? For example, in the Permian, you slightly raised your production guidance only slightly. But, is that based on the same level of activity that you originally forecasted? Are you going faster than expected? We saw in the slide, you cited the performance improvement. But, some of those performance improvements would indicate that you are going faster, so you could be doing more activity. So, just wanted an update on if you\u2019re still thinking about the lower half for the year.\nDarren Woods: Yes. So, I think the guidance that we gave was $16 billion to $19 billion. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that has not changed. And what I said during the Investor Day is that I expect to be on the lower end of that range, and that expectation remains today. They\u2019re not necessarily targets. We have a plan that the business is executing, and that plan includes a spend level. That spend level has not changed. What we\u2019re seeing in the Permian and the point that I tried to make in the slide in the prepared remarks is what\u2019s changed really is the progress that the improvements that that business is making. And what the chart shows you, I think, is really, really impressive performance stuff that we had talked about. And I believe in reorganizing and better leveraging our technology, better leveraging the competencies of the entire organization in this very important resource that we would see significant improvements with time. I think, I\u2019ve been talking about that now for several years. And what that organization is demonstrating is, indeed, they are making improvements and making them at a faster rate than we had planned. And so, that update with the production is a function of that performance improvement. We have not increased the capital allocation to that business. They\u2019re basically running at their planned spend. And obviously, that is -- that plan is across the full year, and that number will change over the year, based on their plan.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Phil Gresh with JP Morgan.\nPhil Gresh: My first question is a bit of a follow-up on the capital spending. Obviously, the run rate in the first quarter is very low, and you\u2019re expecting the full year to be towards the lower end of the range, so call it, $16 billion to $17 billion. You have the $20 billion to $25 billion target out there for the long term, which would obviously be still a pretty big step up from, say, $16 billion to $17 billion. So, just more intermediate term, as we think out to, say, 2022, should we think of the spending being more gradual in terms of the ramp back up, in terms of getting to the 20, 25 long term? Just any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Sure. No, I think what\u2019s important -- so we\u2019ve put the plan out, our plan. We\u2019ve got plans through 2025 with specific numbers. We\u2019re not managing the business to ranges. We have plans. And those ranges frankly reflect the recognition that -- this is -- we got a big business, a lot of variables impacting our projects, things are going to move, and we can\u2019t precisely call exactly when things will occur. But, we\u2019ve got a pretty good basis for that, and that\u2019s the plan. And that range that we\u2019re showing reflects what I would say is how all these pieces tend to kind of come together and manifest themselves in any one quarter or a year. And so, that range gives us, I think, right kind of flexibility to make sure that what we\u2019re talking to you about, some of that inherent variability in the plant. So, we\u2019re not kind of wondering which end of that range we\u2019ll be at. We\u2019ve got plans within that range and what I said continues to be the case that we\u2019re focused on delivering on those plans. I think, the way to think about the spending is, recognize we put these plans together and reviewed them initially with the Board in October and finalized them in November and then very quickly came out with the release that talked about that. If you think about the October time frame and where prices were at, reflect on the chart that I showed you, there was uncertainty as to exactly how the future would manifest itself. We knew that recovery would come just based on some of those underlying fundamentals, but really difficult to call. So, our plans basically were more back-end loaded. And so, what you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter is a reflection of the recognition that while things will recover that we may still have some very challenging times here in the first quarter and into the second quarter, so making sure that we were building plans that comprehended that and anticipated that and would be robust to that. And so, that\u2019s kind of how we built and why the numbers that you see in the first quarter are lower than maybe what would be a ratable run rate is because we had anticipated a probably more challenging environment than certainly that we\u2019re seeing today. So, that will ramp up. I think, the other point I\u2019d make, Phil, is just the point I made about our pace projects and the good work that our project organization did and thinking through, given a portfolio of very attractive, high-return projects. And as I said, we tested all those informed by what we are seeing with the pandemic, tested whether or not they were going to generate the returns and bring the value that we had expected, and all of them continue to look attractive. And so, we wanted to make sure that in the short term, we can serve spend to respond to the challenges of the pandemic, but make sure that we didn\u2019t compromise that longer term value. And that was the real challenge of last year and the plans that we laid out reflect that. And so, as you move forward, in the back half of this year and into next year, what you\u2019re seeing is some of those projects resuming activities on those products -- projects and seeing that spend go up. And so, that\u2019s, I think, how I would suggest you think about that is feathering in those projects in a very managed way that our project organization is working very closely with our partners and contractors to make sure that we bring those things back online and get that work going in a very efficient and effective manner.\nPhil Gresh: Okay. Got it. Thank you. My second question would just be coming back to the Gulf Coast carbon capture opportunity. I\u2019m frequently getting asked for ExxonMobil whether this would be more of just an opportunity to reduce your own GHG commissions, or is it something where it can be a third-party business that\u2019s actually a long-term earnings driver for the Company. So, I\u2019m curious how you would answer that.\nDarren Woods: I\u2019d say yes. I think that project has opportunities to do both. If you -- and again, what we\u2019ve been talking about for some time, and I think if I go back a year ago, the litmus test with respect to whether or not the Company was focused on managing the risk of climate change and position for an energy transition was whether or not you\u2019re investing in solar and wind. Frankly, I\u2019ve been very encouraged at how quickly that conversation has evolved and the recognition that there remains a significant challenge above and beyond the rule that wind and solar and electric vehicles, which they will play an important role. But above and beyond that, how do you decarbonize some of these very difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and do it in a way that is efficient and the lowest cost to society. And so that\u2019s the work that certainly we\u2019ve been talking about for some time and the work that we\u2019ve been investing in with respect to technologies to bring down the cost of the technologies that we believe will be required to achieve that. That\u2019s the venture that we launched in 2018, our carbon capture venture to start looking at how we could commercialize some of that technology and start looking for opportunities around the world. So, all that was happening with this view of what I would say is a business opportunity to meet an evolving demand of society, which is a reduction in CO2. And the way we\u2019re thinking about that, that\u2019s a new business. That\u2019s a new demand for that society, I think, is a strong desire for. And so, we\u2019re at the early stages of a new business. And what we\u2019ve put out there is the opportunity to leverage the skills that we have, the competencies that we\u2019ve developed over decades the experience that we have in bringing new ventures to market, working with governments and leveraging our own capabilities. And this Houston Ship Channel represents exactly that. And we\u2019d be working with a number of companies and industries there, so collaborating with others, working with the government. And our own facilities would be involved in that. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a mix of all those things that you brought up, Phil. It\u2019s an opportunity to reduce our own emissions, an opportunity for others to contribute at scale and a cost-effective way to reduce their emissions. And then, again, potentially, there is a emerging market for CO2 reduction credits, maybe a way to meet that market demand as well. And so, I think it\u2019s early to take a real sharp pencil and lay all that out, but we think the fundamentals are there. And it just becomes -- comes down to then working with the relevant parties to shape the policies and the frameworks and the constructs of that project to take advantage of that -- of those emerging fundamentals.\nStephen Littleton: And Phil, I guess, I\u2019d add. What we\u2019re also seeing is policies being established in other parts of the world where we look at Europe over in Asia Pacific region that are interested in doing similar type of efforts to decarbonize in these hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the industry.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: I also have two questions, if that\u2019s okay.\nDarren Woods: Sure.\nDoug Leggate: Darren, when you laid out the Analyst Day, I think you talked about -- or Neil had talked about something around 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent of disposal impacts in your five-year plan. I realize you\u2019ve gotten UK away now, but can you just bring us up to date that in this, I guess, stronger oil price environment, whether the pace is picking up and how you see that playing out?\nDarren Woods: Sure, Doug. Thanks for the question. What I\u2019d say is, we laid that plan out quite some time ago. Neil talked about the work we had been doing in assessing the portfolio and upgrading that portfolio. And obviously, two -- a couple of levers to that. One, one lever is clearly the additional investments in bringing in more profitable lower cost production opportunities and then working on some of the tail items of our portfolio to see if others put a higher value on them, particularly given how rich the new opportunities were for us. And so, that portfolio of opportunities remains. We\u2019ve been out actively marketing a number of those. And as you can imagine, last year really slowed that pace down just because of the number of buyers, and I\u2019d say the range of uncertainty with where the future was going. The way I\u2019d characterize it today is we\u2019re continuing that activity on those assets. And I\u2019d say, the work that we did in 2020 puts us in a really good position this year. We did not compromise the value that we expected to achieve, and that slowed things down. But I think as we go into this year, there\u2019s different view that\u2019s being taken on the future and the horizon and the price environment, which is generating more interest. And so, the way I\u2019d characterize it right now, same set of assets, a lot more interest and discussions happening. And we\u2019ll see if we can find the right buyer and settle on a value that\u2019s kind of a win-win proposition, and that work goes on. And I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll see that accelerate a bit. But, it will be accelerated based on a lot of work that\u2019s already happened and will continue to happen.\nDoug Leggate: Great. I appreciate that. My follow-up is really more of a kind of philosophical question, Darren. I guess, a year ago, your yield was getting up there. So, very -- you could see uncompetitive level in terms of if you ever wanted to do anything in your equity. It\u2019s obviously a consolidation question. You\u2019ve got a fantastic organic portfolio, and some of your peers are now kind of starting with an investment case, you could argue, meaning growth is off the table for investors for the -- at least on EVs. So, when you rack all that together, I\u2019m just wondering how does Exxon think about participating or not in consolidation, whether it be Permian or whether it be international.\nDarren Woods: Well, I would say, you point out that we have a very strong organic portfolio. And so, I think that gives us a lot of flexibility where we don\u2019t -- we aren\u2019t in a position where we have to go out and transact and look at acquisitions or mergers. But, I would also tell you that at the end of the day, we\u2019re very focused on maximizing our growth in shareholder value, and so, keeping a kind of a firm eye on the opportunity set. And if things develop, if market conditions drive an opportunity that would be accretive and consistent with the existing portfolio and the capital allocation priorities that we\u2019ve talked about, then that would certainly be an opportunity that we\u2019d look at. I don\u2019t think we take anything off the table when it comes to thinking about the future and how we might leverage our capacities. And then, if we find somebody where we can find some synergies with their capabilities and ours and to take advantage of that and together grow value at a rate faster than we can organically. But, I\u2019ll come back to and finish on the point that I started with is we -- the portfolio we\u2019ve got is pretty attractive. It\u2019s going to -- whatever we do is going to have to compete with that attractive portfolio. We feel real good about that. We\u2019ll keep an eye open, but it\u2019s nice not to be in a position where we have to do something.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our last question then from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, guys. And Darren, thanks for coming on these calls. I know investors value the transparency. And hopefully, you can keep this up regularly, not just once a year. I guess, my first question is just on the Board changes. Exxon has announced some changes to Board representation. You\u2019re obviously in the middle of a proxy contest going into the shareholder meeting. Can you just talk about, from your perspective, Darren, why you think that the current set of Boards -- the current Board best represents the interest of shareholders and some of the changes that you made and what these changes are able to deliver for the shareholder?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Well, good morning, Neil. And I\u2019d just start by pointing out, this is the second time this year I\u2019ve been on the call. So, I\u2019ve doubled from your once a year. With respect I think to the Board and how we think about that, the first comment I would make is, since I\u2019ve been in this job, been engaging with shareholders pretty consistently and listening to their perspectives and taking their feedback on. And I think as a result of that, you\u2019ve seen quite a bit of change in terms of how we interface with the shareholders and in fact, with you and your community. So, I think we are responding to the feedback that we get. I would tell you that every decision that the Board has made with new directors, and we\u2019ve brought on six since I came into the chair in 2017, have all been in response to and related to the feedback that we\u2019ve been getting to our shareholders. In terms of the types of competencies and skill sets that they think would benefit our Company and managing for the future. And frankly, that continues to be an ongoing dialogue, and we continue to look for what are the capabilities and skills required to successfully manage a business like ours. If you look at the Board we have today, and how we -- the Board Affairs Committee goes through the processes, I think, first, you got to recognize this is a big business that spans the globe and also spans a number of different industrial sectors, consumer product sectors, very complicated, a lot of challenges across the different countries and across the different businesses. And so, really look to make sure that the folks that we bring into the Board have the perspective and the experience of managing global businesses, complex businesses, ones that span the globe and ones that have the kind of challenges that we see. Obviously, if you look at the industry and our Company over time, technology and the evolution of technology and how that applies to our business has been a really important part of the value creation that we\u2019ve driven over the years and a really important part in terms of the future and how that evolves. And so, technology and understanding of the technology, engineering science is an important part of things that we look for in terms of the skills and capabilities of the investors of our Board members. If you think about the capital intensity of the business and how we are so intimately tied into economic growth in economies around the world and people standards of living, directors have had that experience in managing, I think, is important. And you can see that in some of our directors that have that experience in capital-intensive link closely to economic activity. So, that\u2019s important. And then, I think the third point I would make is understanding of and experience in transitioning businesses. And from our perspective, it\u2019s not necessarily transitioning an energy company. It\u2019s transitioning business with fundamental drivers, how you think about the changes in those fundamental drivers and how you effectively respond to those changes while creating shareholder value. If you look at the folks that we have on the Board, a number of our individuals have really pertinent and relevant experience to managing large corporations successfully through transitions, albeit potentially in different industries. We also look to bring on industry experience that I would tell you has been a capability and competencies that we\u2019ve been working to fill for quite some time. It\u2019s challenging to find someone who has the relevant experience and can relate to all the businesses that we\u2019re in, the scale that we\u2019re in and the global coverage. And I think we were very lucky last year to engage with Wan Zul after he retired in the middle of 2020, and very pleased that he came on the Board and brings some of the experience from Asia, which is obviously a really important region for our Company and the fact that that\u2019s where a lot of the growth is happening. So, that was a big advantage. And then, the final point I\u2019ll make with respect to some of the new directors that we brought on is thinking about a transition with all the uncertainties associated with it and the challenge is how to best allocate your capital in that space and make sure that, one, that you\u2019re moving the business in the direction consistent with some of those broader trends, but doing it in a way that protects shareholder value and generates returns. And so, I think some of the new directors have got some really good -- a really good track record in thinking through and doing that and has been bringing some of that additional perspective to many of our existing directors who also have that capital allocation experience. And so, I think we\u2019ve got a really experienced Board with a lot of complementary skills. And the final point I would make, which is really, really important is the chemistry of the Board, the culture that we have, the willingness for those directors to work collectively, collaboratively to engage, discuss, debate, I think, is absolutely critical. And what we find today is our Board meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of exploring, debating and all done in a very constructive way, all done focused on driving -- ultimately driving value. And so, it\u2019s, I think, a very healthy Board that respects one another, but is very focused at the same time in driving value. And they\u2019ve been a big part in helping reshape the Company and setting us on the path that we\u2019re on now.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks so much, Darren. The follow-up question is just on slide 16. As you think about your growth projects, you talked a little bit about Guyana. Can you just flush out more just how big do you see this asset becoming over time? And what are the next big milestones we should be looking out for? And you didn\u2019t mention greenfield LNG projects. As you think about those in the Q, where do those stand in terms of the projects that you\u2019d look to move forward over the next five years?\nDarren Woods: Sure. I would think with Guyana, with respect to the potential of that resource base, it is -- we\u2019ve talked about 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. I would tell you that is the current estimate and that I would expect it to grow. The recent announcement we made with Uaru-2 confirmed a deeper play. And so, I think additional opportunity or suggestive of an additional opportunity and resources that we haven\u2019t fully quantified yet. So, I think it\u2019s a very rich set of opportunities that we\u2019re going to continue to progress. And I wouldn\u2019t look for a big bang per se. I would look for a continued and steady progression of bringing those opportunities to market. I think, we\u2019ve laid out a plan that\u2019s pretty consistent with that, working very closely with the government and the people of Guyana to continue to progress that resource, and really bring a lot of economic opportunity to the country and the people of Guyana. And I think we\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of that manifest themselves, and will continue to contribute on a ratable basis there. So, I would just say a good, steady drumbeat of improvement as we move through those development and those projects. I think today, we\u2019re talking a potential for 7 to 10 FPSOs, 6 projects online by 2027. So, yes, we feel really good about what we\u2019re finding in Guyana and a very constructive engagement with the government in terms of those developments. With respect to LNG, obviously, gas is going to continue to play a really important role. As economies around the world develop, populations grow, people standards of living grow is all going to require power generation, and gas is going to continue to play an important role, in part because it\u2019s a really good substitute for coal and the fact that it\u2019s got much lower emissions, obviously and lower particulate. It also has the potential with time to basically be used in making hydrogen, and that could play a role going forward as well. So, I think gas is going to continue to be a really important part as societies and economies grow and as we move into lower carbon future. And so, in that context, the LNG opportunities remain an important part of the portfolio. And we continue to work very closely with the governments around progressing discussions on how we continue to build on the portfolio that we have and expand those opportunities, and do it in a way that both benefits the countries and the communities in those countries but at the same time are attractive to us and compete within our portfolio. And so, that work goes on. We\u2019re continuing to have very constructive conversations. And I would expect to see those advance at a pace that\u2019s consistent with those conversations landing at the right frameworks for progressing those projects.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Darren. Congrats on a good quarter.\nDarren Woods: Thanks, Neil.\nStephen Littleton: Okay. Thank you, Darren, for participating. I want to thank the audience for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate your interest and the opportunity to highlight our first quarter results. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. And please be safe.\nOperator: That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be back with you. This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action was clear. We made some tough decisions and committed to bold actions. In our fourth quarter call, I reviewed our results, the success we had in meeting, and in some cases, beating those bold commitments. We made a lot of progress over the course of a challenging year. The positive results we announced today reflect not only last year's work, the work we started years ago, work that has positioned us to take advantage of market improvements. Today, I joined the call to put that work in context. I'll discuss the foundation for success that we've laid and how it will manifest in growing shareholder value, value that will further materialize as markets continue to recover and as the world transitions to a lower carbon future. Our successful response to the unprecedented challenges of 2020 has its roots in two critical initiatives started years earlier. The first was our focus on developing an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investments to recapitalize our businesses and increase capacity to generate earnings and cash. Prioritized investments in these opportunities last year are paying dividends this year and will continue to well into the future. The second initiative, which began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, was a significant restructuring of our businesses, reducing functional silos, organizing along value chains and consolidating competencies. This greatly reduced organizational complexity, interfaces and overhead. We provided a clearer line of sight to the market, increased ownership for earnings at all levels and improved the speed and quality of decision-making across the corporation. Importantly, it helped our people better relate their work to our bottom line results. We see the benefits of this in the first quarter results. Through structural changes, we've permanently reduced operating expenses, capturing $3 billion in 2020 versus 2019, with further efficiencies in the first quarter and more expected through the year. In total, we expect to achieve $6 billion of annual savings by 2023 versus 2019. At the same time, we reduced emissions, operated safely and delivered best-ever reliability performance. Our focus in this area also paid off in the first quarter with a well-managed response to the Texas ice storms, minimizing impacts and speeding recovery. Throughout 2020, we worked to strike a difficult balance, dramatically reducing near-term spend without compromising longer term value. We used our balance sheet to maintain spending that was critical to shareholder value, including sustaining a strong dividend. We also maintained our work in advancing low-carbon technologies and developing projects with the potential to significantly reduce society's emissions. This work is crucial in underpinning our long-term future and in continuing to grow shareholder value. It also facilitated the launch of our Low Carbon Solutions business in the first quarter, a strategic business that we expect to grow with significant investments as we advance low-carbon technologies. We prioritized maintenance activities, ensuring essential work was completed last year and the remainder early this year, ahead of the anticipated demand recovery. We reduced 2020 CapEx by 30% versus our original plan. We did this by pacing project execution and leveraging our global projects organization to prioritize and optimally slow projects. We are continuing to pace projects to rebuild the balance sheet and pay down debt. In the first quarter, we made significant progress. Investments are in line with our outlook for the year of $16 billion to $19 billion, and debt was reduced by over $4 billion. Throughout this time, we've never lost sight of the long-term fundamentals of our business. We knew economies will recover, populations and living standards would continue to grow, ultimately driving demand for our products and an industry recovery. Today, we are beginning to see this and are well positioned. Thanks to our efforts over the last few years, we are a stronger company with an improving outlook. You will, of course, recognize this chart, which we've used since our third quarter call last year. At that time, we made the point that the pandemic had driven industry prices and margins to unsustainably low levels. And while hard to predict when that margins and prices would rebound. And today, we're seeing this rebound, which is happening faster than we thought and for some sectors, rising to higher levels than anticipated. The Upstream is back within the 10-year range with Brent prices improving by roughly 40% since the fourth quarter and natural gas up by about a third. In the Downstream, margins remain well below the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins, on the other hand, has swung from the bottom to the top. One thing is for sure, these margins and prices will continue to move. We've based our plans on a conservative outlook and are positioning our businesses to be successful at or below the bottom of these ranges. At the same time, we're making sure that when the upswings come, we take advantage, which is why we went to great efforts to preserve our portfolio of investments while building in flexibility. It's also why we test each investment against a wide range of market scenarios and insist on structural advantages to generate leading returns at any price. Today's portfolio of opportunities is the best we've seen in 20 years. 90% of our Upstream investments and resource additions over the next five years, including Guyana, Brazil and the Permian, generate 10% returns at $35 a barrel or less. In Guyana, we're continuing to progress Liza Phase 2. Payara is on schedule, and we've begun planning for the next development, Yellowtail. The Bacalhau development offshore Brazil is advancing toward a final investment decision, and we're delivering greater efficiencies in the Permian, efficiencies that are driving down costs for drilling and completions while improving recovery rates and growing production. Based on these improvements and without additional capital, we've increased our 2021 outlook to between 410,000 and 430,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day. The Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is ahead of schedule with a projected start-up in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the project for about 25% less than the average cost of a Gulf Coast steam cracker. This facility is a key development in our plan to grow sales of high-value performance products by 60% through 2027. As we focused our activities on the highest value investments, we also worked hard to preserve the value of the projects we were pacing. As I mentioned, our global projects organization played a critical role in this, working closely with contractors, partners and resource owners to find efficiencies and reduce spend. Every project was reevaluated and tested against conditions informed by the pandemic, while all remained attractive and in our portfolio, the highest-value opportunities were given priority. Pace projects were evaluated for optimum breakpoints, with work continuing until these were reached. You can see this in the photos, which show the project status at the time the pandemic hit and when they were paused. Working closely with contractors, our team successfully offset deferral costs with efficiencies and market savings and preserved portfolio returns of greater than 30%. The CapEx outlook we provided incorporates resumptions of these project activities over time as the market recovers and we make progress deleveraging. Striking the right balance in our capital allocation priority was critical, as demonstrated by the price and margin chart. This was particularly true in the depleting businesses of the Upstream. The value of the choices made here are shown in the next couple of slides. We are excited by the results of the significant work and strategic investments made since 2017 to reshape our portfolio into one of the most price competitive in the industry, generating strong returns in a variety of price environments. Chart on the left, similar to the one used on Investor Day, shows the Brent price needed for upstream resource investments made in 2020 to generate a 10% return. As you can see, more than 90% of the investments require Brent price at or below $35 a barrel. On the right are the anticipated cash flows resulting from the projects retained in our 2020 investment program for this year and in 2025. As you can see, the investments we made in 2020 are making a significant contribution now and into the future. This is particularly true in the Permian, shown on the next slide. Last year, we reduced Permian CapEx by about 35%, but maintained a level of investment to support our technology efforts and drive improvements. This work contributed to an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2020 versus 2019 and an increase of 60,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year. This work also drove significant progress across a number of variables, as shown on the left. Higher well productivity and lower costs resulted in positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year, which will continue through 2021. In addition, with the Poker Lake processing facility online and pipelines commissioned, we can ensure production is delivered to the highest value outlet at the lowest cost. Hopefully, these last two charts help illustrate the importance of striking the right capital allocation balance to preserve longer term value, particularly in trying times. Our first quarter results helped demonstrate this. We maintained our strong dividend, generated strong cash flow, delivered further cost reductions, remained flexible and disciplined in our capital spend, delivered excellent safety, environmental and reliability performance, and advanced solutions for a lower carbon economy. As we progress through this year, we'll maintain our capital priorities and a balanced approach. Our planned capital range for 2021 remains $16 billion to $19 billion with the outyears at $20 billion to $25 billion. If markets take an unexpected downturn, we have the flexibility to adjust. If margins and prices stay higher than planned, we'll deleverage faster, rebuilding the balance sheet. As the price and margin chart I reviewed earlier demonstrated, things can change quickly. A strong balance sheet remains a critical advantage in a capital-intensive commodity business. It also provides an important foundation for managing an uncertain future and the transition of the energy sector, which I'll turn to next. I'll start by restating our strategy and addressing the risks of climate change and the energy transition, a strategy based on four pillars we've had in place for many years. It begins with mitigating emissions in our operations, which has been a focus for decades. Versus 2016, 2020 GHG emissions are down 11%. We met the methane and flaring reductions we committed to in 2018 and established aggressive emission reduction plans through 2025, putting us on a trajectory consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are committed to providing product to help customers reduce their emissions. Across the globe, we're helping economies decarbonize by providing natural gas for power generation, reducing emissions by more than a half versus coal. Our chemical products reduced vehicle weight, lowering transportation emissions and preserve shelf life of food, reducing waste and agricultural emissions. Our fuels and lube products, improve efficiency, also helping to reduce emissions. We're also proactively engaging on climate policy. We've demonstrated this through our support for the Paris agreement and economy-wide price on carbon, consistent regulations to reduce methane emissions and frameworks to support investment in carbon abatement. And finally, we're focusing on developing and deploying scalable technology solutions that are needed to reduce emissions on a larger scale. We're focusing on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors of power generation, heavy-duty transport and industrial manufacturing. We've launched our Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize technologies and accelerate large-scale emission reductions in these areas. Since 2000, we've invested more than $10 billion in lower emissions technologies and have plans to invest an additional $3 billion by 2025. Our initial emphasis is on carbon capture and storage, or CCS, a technology critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. I expect the magnitude of investments to grow as we work with industry, governments and communities to advance attractive project concepts that also generate shareholder value. Having said this, it's important to keep the current level of planned investments in perspective. When you compare the investment levels of our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses with the size of their markets, our spend represents less than 0.3% of the total addressable market. We do the same for our planned investments in CCS. They represent over 3% of the total addressable market, more than 10 times the level of investments in our traditional businesses. We think this is reasonable given the early stage of this market's development. With our industry-leading position and decades of experience in CCS, we're well positioned to successfully compete in this growing and potentially large future market. As we tried to illustrate in this chart, today, we're the global leader in capturing CO2. In fact, we've captured more anthropogenic CO2 than anyone in the world. We have an interest in over one-fifth of the world's CCS capacity and significant holdings in CO2 pipelines. Grass roots, large-scale CCS projects leverage our competitive advantages in technology and project management as well as decades of experience bringing new ventures to market. This is important, particularly for this potentially fast-growing large market, and it's why we launched the Low Carbon Solutions business, which is evaluating and advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities around the world. Last week, we introduced the concept of a multi-industry CCS hub to capture and store CO2 emissions from the heavy industry around the Houston Ship Channel. We think a carbon capture innovation zone, similar to an enterprise zone where incentives and policies are designed to encourage economic growth, is a smart way to advance this idea. We help bring together government incentives and private sector investments along with new policies and regulations that would encourage innovation. Houston is an ideal location for a major project. The plants along the heavily industrialized ship channel represents some of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. They're also relatively close together, providing project scale and reducing unit costs. Houston's proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also provides direct access to suitable storage locations. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the geology beneath the seafloor has the capacity to safely store all the CO2 that the entire country currently produces for the next 100 years. As currently envisioned, the project could capture 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. This would put Houston well on its way to reaching its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. This concept will need support from many different parties, both private and public. Regulatory and legal support at all levels of government will be crucial for establishing incentives and attracting investment. The federal government already provides some carbon reduction incentives such as tax credits for electric vehicle, wind, solar and CCS. Enhancing these credits or establishing a market price on carbon emissions, combined with appropriate rules and oversight, would accelerate solutions. We've long talked about the importance of innovation. This multiuser hub concept is just one example of how we're looking to take on large, complex challenges and find solutions to help meet society's demand for a lower carbon future. This can play an important role in positioning the Company to deliver long-term shareholder value. The first quarter results clearly show that we're on the right path and well positioned for a continued market recovery. We will remain flexible while focusing on disciplined investing in high-return, competitively advantaged projects. This will provide the foundation for strong cash flows, a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet. We will remain relentless in structurally reducing costs by fully leveraging our new organization. We will continue to deliver industry-leading safety and reliability performance, meet our emission reduction plans, and help society transition to a lower carbon future, and we will do all this to grow shareholder value. I look forward to taking your questions. Sure. Thanks, Devin. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we're looking at doing in this space and reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn't have clear market drivers. And the governments have demonstrated, in other industries when they're looking to reduce CO2, they provide stimulus to catalyze advancements of new technology. I think the big difference with what we're talking about here versus some of the other initiatives that the government has supported is there's not an existing business or market that provides some level of financial incentives. And so, I think the work that has to be done with the government is aligning on the incentives to drive investments across industries to drop and lower the CO2 price. And we think we can do that and do it at a very attractive rate of return at much lower prices than what the government is currently spending to reduce CO2. If you recall from our Investor Day, we had a chart that showed the costs associated with reducing CO2 through carbon capture and compare that to the cost of CO2 removal through other mechanisms. And we have the opportunity to reduce significant levels of CO2 at a much lower cost than current policy. So, that will be an important part, policy to drive incentives. You'll need policies and frameworks to support the legal regime for storing CO2. We'll need permitting to put the facilities in place and run the pipelines. You'll need some frameworks to support the storage and access to the storage offshore. So, there's a number of areas that will need to be addressed. And then, obviously, we'll have to work with the industries involved here and work with them collaboratively to bring the CO2 in, and then also, of course, the communities that we'll be operating in. We'll have to work with them. And we think that's all possible. If you think about the work we do around the world in establishing new ventures, bringing new ventures to market, this is very consistent with our experience base. And I'll just point to Guyana, where essentially where we have started from grassroots, a brand-new oil and gas industry, working very closely with the government and community there in Guyana. So we've got experience in this space. We've got experience working in collaboration with other industry partners and experience working with governments to bring these complicated things together at scale and make a significant contribution. Yes, sure. I guess, let me just maybe start with where you ended and with respect to the $6 billion. And I just want to make the point, it's not a target. It's not something that we've laid out and asked the organization to figure out how to achieve it. It's actually part of the plans that we've built. And so, the organization has a clear line of sight to the reductions, and there's -- they've built that into their plans. We're stewarding the businesses every month versus those plans. And so, we feel very good about what we've identified and the work that we have going on. And the first quarter demonstrates that we are continuing to achieve the reductions. I would not take the first quarter results and try to multiply those and move them out. I think you're going to see things move with activities as you go through the year. But, my expectation is, the theme that you're seeing with these reductions will continue, and we will -- we're on track to deliver the $6 billion by the end of 2023. I guess, the final point I would make here, Devin, is my expectation, as we've been working our way through this and translating those plans into action is we'll find more opportunities. I would expect it will beat the target of the plans that we put out there. We've got work going on now that kind of goes across the corporation. I mentioned the fact that we have structurally change the way we run our businesses. That change has now aligned each of the sectors in terms of how we're organized and a lot of the processes that were used to execute the business. That gives us an opportunity to take advantage of this consistency and processes and execution and find additional efficiencies and synergies, and that work's underway, which we'll continue to develop as we move through this year, and I suspect we'll have more to talk about it as we finalize our plans for the year at the back end and into the next year's Investor Day. So, I'm real optimistic that the groundwork that we've laid since 2017 and looking at the businesses and how we reorganize are paying dividends today and are going to continue to pay dividends, well into the future. You're loud and clear, Roger. Sure. And thanks for the question, Roger. I would say, the first quarter performance in Chemicals, first and foremost, reflects that organization's focus on running their operations reliably and safely, a lot of hard work to make sure that the integrity of the operations and the reliability of those operations are maintained. And we did a lot of work over last year. And I think moving into the first quarter. That focus has really helped our manufacturing facilities deal with the freeze and recover very rapidly from that. So, real proud of that effort. It wasn't easy, but that organization really delivered. I think the other thing it demonstrates is the focus that they've had for several years on growing their high-performance products. And we knew that the demand for chemicals has been consistently strong and has been growing in excess of GDP growth around the world. And that fundamental, we think, will continue for some time since chemical plays such an important role in people's modern life and the convenience of the modern life and actually the critical importance of some of the products that chemicals make. Of course, the -- so the big challenge there though is as supply comes on in fairly large chunks, with different plants, that tends to result in supply and demand imbalances and lower margins. And of course, we saw that last year. And frankly, going into this year, we kind of anticipated a lot of capacity coming on, which would squeeze the margins and make for a challenging year. I think what we've seen is with the impact of last year and the pullback in spending that was required due to the pandemic and then probably exacerbated by the Texas storm here with all the capacity in the Gulf Coast area, the supply has gotten pretty tight as demand has continued to move. And then, with the economic recovery and the rebound that we're seeing, that's put some more demand into the system. So, it's -- I think the first quarter reflects good operations, good performance, good focus on growing our high-performance products and some really helpful market conditions from a supply and demand standpoint. My expectation as you move forward is we'll see some of that supply come back on, a recovery from the ice storms and some of this new capacity that was deferred will start to make its way back into the market, and that will help probably ease some of the tightness. But, our expectation is, we'll continue to see a pretty good market here this year for the Chemical business. Yes. Well, as we've said, with our capital allocation priorities, there is three legs to the stool, so to speak. And, obviously, really important for the foundation of success for the future is investing in the right projects, particularly in the Upstream with the depletion nature of that business. We've got to find industry advantaged investment opportunities. In the Chemical business, making sure that we're investing in the high-performance products that meet the demand, the growing demand that we're seeing around the world. And in the Downstream, investing in strategic sites to high-grade their production and make sure that the production is in line with the demand in the marketplace. And so, that's critical element, and that's something that we stay focused on as we went through 2020, making sure that we didn't compromise the value of that particular capital allocation priority. The dividend obviously a critical part of that, and sustaining that dividend was a commitment that we've had for a long, long time, and we stay committed to that. So that's obviously going to be an important factor going forward. And then, the balance sheet is making sure that we maintain the capacity to ride through the commodity cycles and not compromise those first two priorities that I talked to you about. And that's what we did in 2020. Obviously, the pandemic was a very unusual year, much deeper than any typical commodity cycle. So, we had to lean harder on that than we normally would. We're very committed now to making sure that we rebuild that in anticipation of future commodity cycles. I think what we said during the Investor Day was we're going to shoot for something between 20% and 25% debt to capital. And that still feels like a reasonable place to be, and we'll work our way towards that as we go through this year and probably into next, obviously, depending upon the price and margin environment that we find ourselves in. Yes. And so, if you remember how we did that breakeven as we made some assumptions about kind of low end of Chemical and Downstream margins and then average Chemical margin and Downstream margins going forward. And recognizing that that wasn't necessarily forecast, it was just one way to characterize it. And the important point we were trying to make, and I think we've made historically, is as you look at our breakeven, you can't just focus on the crude price that we've got significant businesses in both the Downstream and Chemicals that obviously impact that. I would say, we haven't tried to update that number. I think what we tried to do with the Investor Day is just give you and others the confidence that with our portfolio and the plans that we had, we were robust to a very wide range of prices. The fact that the Chemical margins are as good as they are today says that that breakeven has come down. But frankly, we're not really sharpening our pencils anymore on that because we've got a plan, and the foundations of that plant haven't changed. I just think we feel better about the position that we're in today, given where the market is at. We'll take advantage of it while it's here. But, I would tell you that our plans aren't based on those sustaining themselves. And as I said, we will pay down the debt and deleverage faster, given the help that we're getting from the market right now. That's just put us in a stronger position for the future. Yes. So, I think the guidance that we gave was $16 billion to $19 billion. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that has not changed. And what I said during the Investor Day is that I expect to be on the lower end of that range, and that expectation remains today. They're not necessarily targets. We have a plan that the business is executing, and that plan includes a spend level. That spend level has not changed. What we're seeing in the Permian and the point that I tried to make in the slide in the prepared remarks is what's changed really is the progress that the improvements that that business is making. And what the chart shows you, I think, is really, really impressive performance stuff that we had talked about. And I believe in reorganizing and better leveraging our technology, better leveraging the competencies of the entire organization in this very important resource that we would see significant improvements with time. I think, I've been talking about that now for several years. And what that organization is demonstrating is, indeed, they are making improvements and making them at a faster rate than we had planned. And so, that update with the production is a function of that performance improvement. We have not increased the capital allocation to that business. They're basically running at their planned spend. And obviously, that is -- that plan is across the full year, and that number will change over the year, based on their plan. Sure. No, I think what's important -- so we've put the plan out, our plan. We've got plans through 2025 with specific numbers. We're not managing the business to ranges. We have plans. And those ranges frankly reflect the recognition that -- this is -- we got a big business, a lot of variables impacting our projects, things are going to move, and we can't precisely call exactly when things will occur. But, we've got a pretty good basis for that, and that's the plan. And that range that we're showing reflects what I would say is how all these pieces tend to kind of come together and manifest themselves in any one quarter or a year. And so, that range gives us, I think, right kind of flexibility to make sure that what we're talking to you about, some of that inherent variability in the plant. So, we're not kind of wondering which end of that range we'll be at. We've got plans within that range and what I said continues to be the case that we're focused on delivering on those plans. I think, the way to think about the spending is, recognize we put these plans together and reviewed them initially with the Board in October and finalized them in November and then very quickly came out with the release that talked about that. If you think about the October time frame and where prices were at, reflect on the chart that I showed you, there was uncertainty as to exactly how the future would manifest itself. We knew that recovery would come just based on some of those underlying fundamentals, but really difficult to call. So, our plans basically were more back-end loaded. And so, what you're seeing in the first quarter is a reflection of the recognition that while things will recover that we may still have some very challenging times here in the first quarter and into the second quarter, so making sure that we were building plans that comprehended that and anticipated that and would be robust to that. And so, that's kind of how we built and why the numbers that you see in the first quarter are lower than maybe what would be a ratable run rate is because we had anticipated a probably more challenging environment than certainly that we're seeing today. So, that will ramp up. I think, the other point I'd make, Phil, is just the point I made about our pace projects and the good work that our project organization did and thinking through, given a portfolio of very attractive, high-return projects. And as I said, we tested all those informed by what we are seeing with the pandemic, tested whether or not they were going to generate the returns and bring the value that we had expected, and all of them continue to look attractive. And so, we wanted to make sure that in the short term, we can serve spend to respond to the challenges of the pandemic, but make sure that we didn't compromise that longer term value. And that was the real challenge of last year and the plans that we laid out reflect that. And so, as you move forward, in the back half of this year and into next year, what you're seeing is some of those projects resuming activities on those products -- projects and seeing that spend go up. And so, that's, I think, how I would suggest you think about that is feathering in those projects in a very managed way that our project organization is working very closely with our partners and contractors to make sure that we bring those things back online and get that work going in a very efficient and effective manner. I'd say yes. I think that project has opportunities to do both. If you -- and again, what we've been talking about for some time, and I think if I go back a year ago, the litmus test with respect to whether or not the Company was focused on managing the risk of climate change and position for an energy transition was whether or not you're investing in solar and wind. Frankly, I've been very encouraged at how quickly that conversation has evolved and the recognition that there remains a significant challenge above and beyond the rule that wind and solar and electric vehicles, which they will play an important role. But above and beyond that, how do you decarbonize some of these very difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and do it in a way that is efficient and the lowest cost to society. And so that's the work that certainly we've been talking about for some time and the work that we've been investing in with respect to technologies to bring down the cost of the technologies that we believe will be required to achieve that. That's the venture that we launched in 2018, our carbon capture venture to start looking at how we could commercialize some of that technology and start looking for opportunities around the world. So, all that was happening with this view of what I would say is a business opportunity to meet an evolving demand of society, which is a reduction in CO2. And the way we're thinking about that, that's a new business. That's a new demand for that society, I think, is a strong desire for. And so, we're at the early stages of a new business. And what we've put out there is the opportunity to leverage the skills that we have, the competencies that we've developed over decades the experience that we have in bringing new ventures to market, working with governments and leveraging our own capabilities. And this Houston Ship Channel represents exactly that. And we'd be working with a number of companies and industries there, so collaborating with others, working with the government. And our own facilities would be involved in that. So, I think it's kind of a mix of all those things that you brought up, Phil. It's an opportunity to reduce our own emissions, an opportunity for others to contribute at scale and a cost-effective way to reduce their emissions. And then, again, potentially, there is a emerging market for CO2 reduction credits, maybe a way to meet that market demand as well. And so, I think it's early to take a real sharp pencil and lay all that out, but we think the fundamentals are there. And it just becomes -- comes down to then working with the relevant parties to shape the policies and the frameworks and the constructs of that project to take advantage of that -- of those emerging fundamentals. Sure. Sure, Doug. Thanks for the question. What I'd say is, we laid that plan out quite some time ago. Neil talked about the work we had been doing in assessing the portfolio and upgrading that portfolio. And obviously, two -- a couple of levers to that. One, one lever is clearly the additional investments in bringing in more profitable lower cost production opportunities and then working on some of the tail items of our portfolio to see if others put a higher value on them, particularly given how rich the new opportunities were for us. And so, that portfolio of opportunities remains. We've been out actively marketing a number of those. And as you can imagine, last year really slowed that pace down just because of the number of buyers, and I'd say the range of uncertainty with where the future was going. The way I'd characterize it today is we're continuing that activity on those assets. And I'd say, the work that we did in 2020 puts us in a really good position this year. We did not compromise the value that we expected to achieve, and that slowed things down. But I think as we go into this year, there's different view that's being taken on the future and the horizon and the price environment, which is generating more interest. And so, the way I'd characterize it right now, same set of assets, a lot more interest and discussions happening. And we'll see if we can find the right buyer and settle on a value that's kind of a win-win proposition, and that work goes on. And I'm optimistic that we'll see that accelerate a bit. But, it will be accelerated based on a lot of work that's already happened and will continue to happen. Well, I would say, you point out that we have a very strong organic portfolio. And so, I think that gives us a lot of flexibility where we don't -- we aren't in a position where we have to go out and transact and look at acquisitions or mergers. But, I would also tell you that at the end of the day, we're very focused on maximizing our growth in shareholder value, and so, keeping a kind of a firm eye on the opportunity set. And if things develop, if market conditions drive an opportunity that would be accretive and consistent with the existing portfolio and the capital allocation priorities that we've talked about, then that would certainly be an opportunity that we'd look at. I don't think we take anything off the table when it comes to thinking about the future and how we might leverage our capacities. And then, if we find somebody where we can find some synergies with their capabilities and ours and to take advantage of that and together grow value at a rate faster than we can organically. But, I'll come back to and finish on the point that I started with is we -- the portfolio we've got is pretty attractive. It's going to -- whatever we do is going to have to compete with that attractive portfolio. We feel real good about that. We'll keep an eye open, but it's nice not to be in a position where we have to do something. Yes. Well, good morning, Neil. And I'd just start by pointing out, this is the second time this year I've been on the call. So, I've doubled from your once a year. With respect I think to the Board and how we think about that, the first comment I would make is, since I've been in this job, been engaging with shareholders pretty consistently and listening to their perspectives and taking their feedback on. And I think as a result of that, you've seen quite a bit of change in terms of how we interface with the shareholders and in fact, with you and your community. So, I think we are responding to the feedback that we get. I would tell you that every decision that the Board has made with new directors, and we've brought on six since I came into the chair in 2017, have all been in response to and related to the feedback that we've been getting to our shareholders. In terms of the types of competencies and skill sets that they think would benefit our Company and managing for the future. And frankly, that continues to be an ongoing dialogue, and we continue to look for what are the capabilities and skills required to successfully manage a business like ours. If you look at the Board we have today, and how we -- the Board Affairs Committee goes through the processes, I think, first, you got to recognize this is a big business that spans the globe and also spans a number of different industrial sectors, consumer product sectors, very complicated, a lot of challenges across the different countries and across the different businesses. And so, really look to make sure that the folks that we bring into the Board have the perspective and the experience of managing global businesses, complex businesses, ones that span the globe and ones that have the kind of challenges that we see. Obviously, if you look at the industry and our Company over time, technology and the evolution of technology and how that applies to our business has been a really important part of the value creation that we've driven over the years and a really important part in terms of the future and how that evolves. And so, technology and understanding of the technology, engineering science is an important part of things that we look for in terms of the skills and capabilities of the investors of our Board members. If you think about the capital intensity of the business and how we are so intimately tied into economic growth in economies around the world and people standards of living, directors have had that experience in managing, I think, is important. And you can see that in some of our directors that have that experience in capital-intensive link closely to economic activity. So, that's important. And then, I think the third point I would make is understanding of and experience in transitioning businesses. And from our perspective, it's not necessarily transitioning an energy company. It's transitioning business with fundamental drivers, how you think about the changes in those fundamental drivers and how you effectively respond to those changes while creating shareholder value. If you look at the folks that we have on the Board, a number of our individuals have really pertinent and relevant experience to managing large corporations successfully through transitions, albeit potentially in different industries. We also look to bring on industry experience that I would tell you has been a capability and competencies that we've been working to fill for quite some time. It's challenging to find someone who has the relevant experience and can relate to all the businesses that we're in, the scale that we're in and the global coverage. And I think we were very lucky last year to engage with Wan Zul after he retired in the middle of 2020, and very pleased that he came on the Board and brings some of the experience from Asia, which is obviously a really important region for our Company and the fact that that's where a lot of the growth is happening. So, that was a big advantage. And then, the final point I'll make with respect to some of the new directors that we brought on is thinking about a transition with all the uncertainties associated with it and the challenge is how to best allocate your capital in that space and make sure that, one, that you're moving the business in the direction consistent with some of those broader trends, but doing it in a way that protects shareholder value and generates returns. And so, I think some of the new directors have got some really good -- a really good track record in thinking through and doing that and has been bringing some of that additional perspective to many of our existing directors who also have that capital allocation experience. And so, I think we've got a really experienced Board with a lot of complementary skills. And the final point I would make, which is really, really important is the chemistry of the Board, the culture that we have, the willingness for those directors to work collectively, collaboratively to engage, discuss, debate, I think, is absolutely critical. And what we find today is our Board meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of exploring, debating and all done in a very constructive way, all done focused on driving -- ultimately driving value. And so, it's, I think, a very healthy Board that respects one another, but is very focused at the same time in driving value. And they've been a big part in helping reshape the Company and setting us on the path that we're on now. Sure. I would think with Guyana, with respect to the potential of that resource base, it is -- we've talked about 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. I would tell you that is the current estimate and that I would expect it to grow. The recent announcement we made with Uaru-2 confirmed a deeper play. And so, I think additional opportunity or suggestive of an additional opportunity and resources that we haven't fully quantified yet. So, I think it's a very rich set of opportunities that we're going to continue to progress. And I wouldn't look for a big bang per se. I would look for a continued and steady progression of bringing those opportunities to market. I think, we've laid out a plan that's pretty consistent with that, working very closely with the government and the people of Guyana to continue to progress that resource, and really bring a lot of economic opportunity to the country and the people of Guyana. And I think we're beginning to see the benefits of that manifest themselves, and will continue to contribute on a ratable basis there. So, I would just say a good, steady drumbeat of improvement as we move through those development and those projects. I think today, we're talking a potential for 7 to 10 FPSOs, 6 projects online by 2027. So, yes, we feel really good about what we're finding in Guyana and a very constructive engagement with the government in terms of those developments. With respect to LNG, obviously, gas is going to continue to play a really important role. As economies around the world develop, populations grow, people standards of living grow is all going to require power generation, and gas is going to continue to play an important role, in part because it's a really good substitute for coal and the fact that it's got much lower emissions, obviously and lower particulate. It also has the potential with time to basically be used in making hydrogen, and that could play a role going forward as well. So, I think gas is going to continue to be a really important part as societies and economies grow and as we move into lower carbon future. And so, in that context, the LNG opportunities remain an important part of the portfolio. And we continue to work very closely with the governments around progressing discussions on how we continue to build on the portfolio that we have and expand those opportunities, and do it in a way that both benefits the countries and the communities in those countries but at the same time are attractive to us and compete within our portfolio. And so, that work goes on. We're continuing to have very constructive conversations. And I would expect to see those advance at a pace that's consistent with those conversations landing at the right frameworks for progressing those projects. Thanks, Neil."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning everyone and welcome to ExxonMobil fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our fourth quarter earnings news release is posted in the same location and will be joined by the transcript, once it's available. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from his presentation. That will analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at about 8:30 A.M. Central Time. During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, so we encourage you to read our cautionary statement on slide two. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments is listed in our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Also, as a reminder, we posted our Advancing Climate Solutions report, Sustainability Report, and Energy Outlook online in mid-December. We reference them in today\u2019s presentation, and you can find them on our website under the Sustainability tab. Lastly, in the past we\u2019ve held an annual Investor Day in March. We won\u2019t be hosting an Investor Day in 2023. Last December, we laid out comprehensive plans for 2023 through 2027 as part of our Corporate Plan Update and the company is already executing on these plans. We\u2019ve been enjoying the higher level of investor engagement that we\u2019ve been having. We\u2019ll continue to seek your feedback, to host events that give you access to our leaders and insights on parts of the business that interest you, and to share with you information about the company and our plans on more of a real-time basis. With that, I'll hand it over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thanks Jennifer. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Before covering our 2022 results, I want to start by recognizing our people. Their hard work and commitment, not only to the company, but to meeting the critical needs of society, are what drove the strong results we reported this morning. Their work is not easy, whether it\u2019s achieving industry-leading safety, driving record levels of environmental performance, increasing production, offsetting run-away inflation, effectively responding to expropriations, or quickly recovering from winter storms, to name just a few of the challenges, our people delivered while, I\u2019ll add, continuing to manage significant, ongoing organizational changes. As I cover our results, I think you\u2019ll see why we, and the entire management team are so proud of their efforts. Of course, our results clearly benefited from a favorable market but, to take full advantage of the undersupplied market, our work began years ago, well before the pandemic when we chose to invest counter-cyclically. We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom. We continued with these investments through the pandemic and into today. This year, our improved asset portfolio, organizational changes, and strong operating performance came together to deliver industry-leading results; industry-leading earnings, cash flows, return on capital employed, and total shareholder returns. Excluding asset sales, we had our best cash flow performance since the merger. And, despite lower revenues, we delivered higher profits than 2012, our previous record year with a 400-basis point improvement in profit margin, reflecting upgrades to our product mix, structural cost reductions, and disciplined expense management. 2022 was also a year of strong progress across our five strategic priorities. Importantly, we\u2019ve continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian at a time when the world needed it most. We implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage our scale and integration, improve effectiveness, and better serve our customers. We combined our downstream and chemical companies to form Product Solutions, the world\u2019s largest fuels, chemicals, and lubricants business. This new integrated business is focused on developing high value products, improving portfolio value, and leading in sustainability. We\u2019re also now supporting our businesses with corporate-wide organizations including projects, technology, engineering, operations, safety, and sustainability. We see further opportunities in supply chain, procurement, and finance. We continued to expand our Low Carbon Solutions business, recently signing the first-of-its kind customer contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This agreement, in a hard-to-decarbonize sector, highlights how ExxonMobil can leverage our advantages to help others reduce their emissions and build an attractive business with strong returns and significant opportunities for growth. The recent passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes both hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, further reinforces this. To that end, in December, we shared our plans to invest approximately $17 billion in lower-emission opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in our prior plan. We also made significant progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our existing operations and remain on track with our 2030 emissions reduction plans, including net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. In addition to investing in industry advantaged projects, we took advantage of the strong markets to further high grade our asset portfolio with approximately $5 billion in divestments of non-core assets. CapEx was in line with our guidance. To further increase transparency, in 2022, we introduced three new reports; The Lobbying Report, which provides additional disclosure of our lobbying activities and expenditures; The Climate Lobbying Report, which provides details on our US activities at the federal and state level; and our Investing in People supplement, an addition to our updated Sustainability Report. Lastly, as I mentioned, the hard work of our people underpinned our success this past year, as it has done for decades. We build on this advantage every year by attracting and developing the best talent. This past year, we were once again recognized as top in industry for most attractive employer among US engineering students, an honor we\u2019ve received 10 years in a row. Our 2022 financial results, which led the industry, further confirmed the strength of the strategy we developed five years ago. We grew earnings to nearly $56 billion -- $59 billion excluding identified items; significantly outpacing peers. We delivered an industry-leading total shareholder return of 87% and a return on capital employed of 25%, our highest one-year ROCE since 2012. Cash flow from operating activities was nearly $77 billion, also leading the industry. This enabled us to reduce net debt to 5%, fortifying the balance sheet and positioning us to continue our strategy of counter cyclically investing. Our continued focus on leveraging scale and integration drove further efficiencies with nearly $6.9 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019, up from $5.3 billion at the end of 2021. We remain on plan to meet our target of $9 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2023. Consistent with our capital-allocation strategy, we continue to share our success with shareholders through a reliable and growing dividend. In 2022, we boosted the quarterly dividend by more than 3% and marked the 40th consecutive annual increase. Additionally, we increased our share repurchase program twice during the year. In total, we returned $30 billion to shareholders in 2022, including about $15 billion in dividends, which also led peers. These actions reflect the confidence we have in our strategy, the performance we\u2019ve seen across our businesses, and the strength of our company\u2019s future. We\u2019re proud of our people and their work to meet the evolving needs of society. As we advance our strategy and the and equation, we\u2019re committed to sharing their progress. Consistent with this, we continue to enhance our disclosures and increase transparency. In December, we updated several important online publications. Our latest Sustainability Report describes the 14 focus areas where we believe our company can have the most impact. The Advancing Climate Solutions 2023 Progress Report outlines our approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net-zero future. It includes updated resiliency modeling under the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, including the addition of carbon and pricing assumptions, and an audit statement from Wood Mackenzie. In addition, it includes a discussion on the value of a life-cycle approach to measuring company specific emissions vs. Scope 3 targets. We believe a life-cycle approach for companies is more aligned with the principles of ESG, better reflects a company\u2019s efforts to reduce society\u2019s emissions, and avoids the negative consequences of a company-specific Scope 3 target. The update also contains more information on how we\u2019re driving reductions in methane emissions. And finally, it includes a look at the role of plastics in the energy transition, and how we\u2019re expanding our capacity for advanced recycling to help address the issue of plastic waste. Separately, we\u2019ve updated our outlook for energy, which is our latest view of energy supply and demand through 2050. It forms the basis for our business planning. In addition to assessing trends in economic development, technology advances, and consumer behavior, our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often target specific sectors. We encourage you to read these publications to gain a better understanding of how we\u2019re working to be a leader in the energy transition. They\u2019re available on our website under the Sustainability tab. Our plan for 2023 remains anchored in our existing strategy and builds on our continuing success. I\u2019ll wrap up by highlighting a few key areas. Critically, we\u2019ll continue our efforts to lead the industry in safety, operating, and financial performance. We\u2019ll continue to profitably grow the business through advantaged investments to meet the world\u2019s evolving needs and reduce emissions. We\u2019ll further leverage our new organization to fully realize our advantages in scale and integration and improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver another $2 billion in structural cost reductions, meeting our target of $9 billion in savings versus 2019. We\u2019ll look to capture additional organizational synergies by consolidating our supply chain activities and centralizing a majority of our finance and procurement operations. This will help us take better advantage of our scale and greatly improve our customer, vendor, and employee experience. We anticipate 2023 capital and exploration expenses of $23 billion to $25 billion. This includes investments in the next development in Guyana, and increased spending in US unconventional assets. It also includes advancing our China chemical complex and numerous emission reduction opportunities. We\u2019ll advance our work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity in our operated assets and help customers reduce theirs focusing on hard to decarbonize sectors. We\u2019ll continue to progress our blue hydrogen project in Baytown, that consists of a billion cubic foot per day blue hydrogen plant, the world\u2019s largest, and a CCS project with potential to store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year. We\u2019ll also leverage our recent success in Louisiana to grow the customer base for our Low Carbon Solutions business. As the energy system evolves, our focus on the fundamentals and investments in an integrated but diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses will play a crucial role in capturing value and outperforming competition irrespective of the pace or path of the transition. As you\u2019ve seen, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities: investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage across the commodity cycles, and sharing our success through shareholder distributions. We\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and further sharing our success through the share repurchase program with up to $35 billion in cumulative repurchases in 2023 and 2024. 2022 demonstrated the importance of the and equation and the strength of our strategy. We feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made and even better about the opportunities ahead. With that, let me call over to Jennifer.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Dan. Now, let's move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. With that, Jennifer, please open up the lines for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jeanine Wai with -- I apologize. We\u2019ll go first to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Two things. First on your comment Darren on runaway inflation. Obviously, the Permian gets a lot the headlines there. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the offshore environment, ExxonMobil is one of the most active in the space there. So, I just want to get a sense of what you're seeing inflation in offshore? And then second question is on CapEx and I probably shouldn't do this. But if I take the 4Q numbers and annualize them, it would be above the 2023 guide, obviously I have to adjust for a little bit seasonality there. But I would have thought you'd be adding growth CapEx 2023 versus 2022, plus you have the inflationary pressures as you mentioned. How much contingency is there in the 2023 CapEx guidance? And what are the risks there, the upside or downside? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes, good morning Biraj. Let me start with your last question and then move to the first. With respect to CapEx, if you look at the range we've given, I think we've indicated in the comments and I just -- the comments I just made that we'll be at the upper end of that range, which is consistent with a slight increase given the work that we're doing. But I would reiterate that the broader range that we've given over the years continues to fit well with our plans and is consistent with the pacing that we established when we came out of the pandemic. As I mentioned before, we had worked with our contractors to lay out a plan for how we continue to progress those investments. And I would tell you today with our projects organization feel really good about the progress we're making, the efficiencies that we're gaining with our CapEx. If you look at the pause that we had to take due to the pandemic, we basically offset any of those costs to maintain the same level of productivity of our spend going forwards. So, something real proud of the projects organization is doing. So, I would expect to continue to stay within that range. And if that changes, obviously, in the years to come, we'll update you as our plans develop and make sure you all stay aware of that. With respect to the inflation, I would say, from an operating expense standpoint, one point I'd make is if you look at what the organization did year-on-year, essentially, with all the synergies that we are capturing, some of the scale advantages and purchasing power we had, essentially, the businesses collectively came in on plants. We're able to offset the inflation that we were seeing from an expense standpoint, which was obviously no easy task. I think on the -- if you look at the different projects around the world, it really is a function of when we chose to engage the contractors and engage the equipment that we're using. I mean, if you look at the Permian, it's the short cycle and where there's a lot of activity. And so like other parts of our business, supply and demand gets tight and puts pressure on pricing, there's less of that supply/demand pressure in other parts of the business and so not seeing the same kind of pressure that we're seeing in the Permian, that tends to be the one area that's really, really hot. But I think in all those areas, we're using the size of the business that we have and the long-term plans that we have and long-term commitments that we can make with our contracting partners to make sure that we're keeping those in check and that our partners are playing the long game here with us. So, I think we've done a pretty good job of keeping capital productivity pretty high, feel pretty good about that. Kathy, anything you want to add?\nKathryn Mikells: Just the other thing I would add is I'd really caution you about taking the fourth quarter CapEx and exploration expense and kind of annualizing it because we tend to run a bit higher in the fourth quarter and the expenses and kind of prorated over the years. Overall, 2022 came in right about where we expected it. And when we talked about our Corporate Plan in December, we said we expect it to be at about $23 billion to $25 billion in 2023. And that we expected to see a little bit of an increase year-over-year, in part because Payara has been pulled forward, so we have a little more spending there. China One is starting to spool up and obviously, our emission plans are also spooling up. So, right now I'd say we're very consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we've given you.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nDarren Woods: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question.\nDarren Woods: Good morning Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: Good morning Kathy, good morning Darren. Questions on the downstream which was a nice positive in 2022. And how do you think the EU embargo on Russian product imports on February 5th will impact your refining margins? And I guess what we're thinking is that there's a number of moving pieces between your refining footprint, particularly in the Gulf Coast and Europe and then there's potential tailwinds for diesel margins as Russian exports dissipate. But there's also probably need to take into account the likely incremental tightness in [BTO] (ph) supplies? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I'll take that Jeanine. I think -- start with just the market in general and I think the driver behind the refining margins that we've seen here of late is driven by the pandemic impacts of shutting down capacity and then not having that capacity available as demand has recovered. So, the world remains pretty tight and it will stay I think tight, while we wait for additional refinery expansions to come online, primarily out in Asia and the Middle East. I think the Russia impact and the ban on products going into Europe could potentially have some short-term implications. At the end of the day that -- those products are going to be needed. So, it really is around logistics, I'll call it, disoptimization to where the market is pretty efficient and we've got the most efficient supply chains and logistics systems lined out. We're going to disrupt those and I think it's a question of how does that disruption manifest itself in the market and what kind of disconnects and discontinuities do you see in the short-term? And then ultimately, we'll read that -- the system will stabilize, reoptimize and I expect higher costs just because of your moving to a less optimum logistics approach, but more stable. I don't know -- that's -- that -- I see how that\u2019s going to play out. So, I don't think there'll be a long-term impact, it'll be a short-term one and then there's just a question how long it takes for the systems to rebalance. I think more fundamental to refining is the shortness and with the economies picking up and with China coming out of its COVID lockdown and the economic growth there and then the view that you take on the economic impacts and how severe recessions are here this year, that's probably going to play a much bigger role. If demand picks up, economies continue to grow, we're going to see that tightness manifests itself and continued higher refining margins, which I think will mean a fairly high margins this year and potentially going into 2024 as well.\nJeanine Wai: Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thank you, Darren and Kathy. I wanted to spend some time on the Permian outlook for 2023, you made some comments in the prepared remarks about getting to over 600,000 barrels a day. So, I guess that's about 10% growth as we think about 2023. But just your thoughts on volumes and then ultimately, where should we think about plateau?\nDarren Woods: Yes, thanks, Neil. I would take you back to 2018 when we were talking about our strategy in the Permian and we've said at that time, our plan was to grow to 1 million barrels a day of production by 2025. When the pandemic hit, we basically said, there's going to be a delay in a lot of our plans and pushed out those objectives by about two years. So, moving from 2025 to 2027. If you'll look at my comments and the plans, we're now forecasting that our Permian production will reach about 1 million barrels a day by 2027. So, very much in line, going all the way back to 2018. And then the comments that we made around the pandemic and the delay that I was introducing. So, I think that's the context to think about what we're doing in the Permian and that development. If you look at 2021, we added about 90,000 barrels a day of production. 2022, very similar number, 90,000 barrels a day. And that in part was what I'd call, the organic development and drilling into production as well as clearing our DUCs inventory. So, as we were in the pandemic, obviously, not a lot of incentive to bring production on and so we concentrated our spend on drilling. And then as we got into higher-priced environments, concentrated on clearing that inventory and bringing those wells to production, and so we were bringing our DUC inventory down. As we go into next year, we're going to rebuild that inventory, get to an optimum level that we can then use and maintain as we go through the next several years. So, that's kind of a strategy of how we're working out. If you think about, ultimately getting to 1 million barrels a day by 2027, that's roughly at 13% compounded annual growth rate. That's going to -- that's not going to be steady every year, that'll kind of fluctuate, call it, plus or minus 5%. That's kind of order of magnitude how we'll see that playing out. And any one year's production will be a function of the development plans we have and how those development plans manifest themselves in that specific timeframe. But I think bottom-line is we're basically on plan moving at the pace that we anticipated. And I'm hopeful that as we continue to focus on the technology developments and continuing to improve efficiency, we'll see either that production bottom-line with more effectively at lower cost, or in fact, more productivity and higher production. But that's a function of the ongoing work we've got to bring our technology and operational capabilities to bear in the Permian continue to improve what we're doing there.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks Darren.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nDarren Woods: Morning.\nDevin McDermott: So, I wanted to ask about the Chemicals business and if we look at the margin chart that you have in the slide deck, it's the one part of the portfolio where margins are still below the 10-year range. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing there as you move into early 2023 with China reopening and that potentially being a positive driver for margins. And then also just talk through some of the discrete growth projects we got coming on over the next few years to drive that that earnings growth you talked about at the Investor Day last year, I think Baytown, you noted later this year and get the China Chemicals Complex still a few years out, but some of the growth projects and the progress there as well?\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. I think maybe just take both sides of the equation with Chemicals. I'll start with the demand side of the equation, which you referenced and you're right. I think one of the things we saw last year was with the China lockdowns and the lack of growth in China, which is a big, as you know, chemical market that that had an impact on the demand side of the equation. My expectation as we move into this year and the China economy continues to open up, we'll see that demand pick back up again. And then again, a function of whether how deep and how widespread the recessions are around the world, that's going to have an impact. If current conventions and thinking holds and recessions are milder than people anticipated, I think that'll see a benefit in the chemical on the demand side as well. From a supply side, which is a big part of what's suppressing margins today, as we came out -- went into the pandemic, there were a lot of chemical projects that got put on hold and deferred investments. And you're now seeing as we came out of the pandemic and you look at margins in 2021, 2022, very strong chemical margins, we saw those investments get leaned into and a lot of that capacity coming online. So, we've got this a large capacity additions coming on at the same time where we've had some demand slowdown. So, I think what we're seeing play out here is that what I would say is the typical supply/demand swings in that commodity cycle exacerbated somewhat by the effects of the pandemic, still kind of playing itself out, but not inconsistent with what we had anticipated coming out of the pandemic. And so it'll be -- it'll take a little time for that demand to pick up and fill that capacity, but it will get back on the growth trajectory, markets will get tight again. So, that's how we're thinking about the Chemical business. With respect to our projects, feel really good about -- we had to pause those, as you know coming out of the pandemic where we had to make some tough choices about how we spend our capital. We'd never done that before in terms of stopping some projects in midstream. But I again, I'll tell you the organization did a great job of putting those on pause, preserving where we're at, continuing to work with contractors to drive efficiency, and now we're bringing those back on basically in line with the plans that we've laid out in the pandemic. We just brought on the polypropylene unit in Baton Rouge. We've got our Baytown Vistamaxx, and LAO projects, which we anticipate coming on here middle of this year, and then China One is making really good progress and expect that to come on in 2025. So, I think all those investments we feel really good about and are on the path that we had anticipated.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning Darren.\nDarren Woods: Morning Doug.\nDoug Leggate: I don't know what show whether you -- or Kathy, which one of you two would like to take this, but I want to ask you about your treatment of the European windfall taxes. I'm understanding as you are, I guess suing to try and get some resolution there and treating these as non-recurring. So, can you can you walk us through your rationale versus how your peers are thinking about this? And any cash impacts that you had to incur in the current quarter I guess, would be my clarification question? But thank you for taking my question.\nKathryn Mikells: Sure. So, I'll first I'll first just talk about the financial impacts. In the current quarter, we wouldn't have had material impacts. Obviously, there were some countries in Europe that had passed incremental taxes earlier this year. So, I'll point to Italy and the UK, as an example. And so we would have been accruing those appropriately. You would have seen as part of our identified items that we booked $1.8 billion associated with 2022. Overall, increased additional European taxes. Now, in terms of the cash impact that doesn't really hit in 2022, we just took the we took the overall accrual and those payments will end up occurring both in 2023 and in 2024. It just depends on the individual countries. But if I take an overall step back and say we looked at what happened in the EU and said, it's not legal and it's the opposite of what is needed, right. So, what's needed right now is more supply and instead, what's been put in place is a penalty on the broad energy sector. So, I'll contrast that with what's happened more recently in the United States with the Inflation Reduction Act, right. There you see policy that's put out to incent industry, both to accelerate technology and decelerate investment, that's greatly needed, especially in areas where the industries in terms of lowering emissions are still pretty nascent, things like hydrogen and CCS, and you're already seeing investment start to flow into those industries.\nDarren Woods: And I would just add, Doug, I think, obviously, we're -- we've been engaged with governments throughout Europe. And I do think there is a sensitivity to the impact on future investments and industries' appetite to continue to invest in what is a challenging market environment in the first place with respect to Europe, becoming more uncertain and less stable. So, I think there was some concern going into this and my suspicion will be many in industry, this will be yet another reason to pull back on their investments in Europe. And I'm not sure you're going to then see that begin to propagate around the world just because of the negative impact it has on an industry that requires stable policy and some certainty when you're making the size of investments that the industry makes over the time horizon that we make them in. So, my sense is that there will be a lot of unintended negative consequences that come from this and as that manifest itself, a lot less appetite for doing this.\nDoug Leggate: Appreciate your perspectives, guys. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: Thanks very much Darren and Kathy. Darren could you just make some sort of high-level comments about the competitive landscape you see across the business? I know this is sort of a broad question, but upstream Energy Products, Low Carbon Solutions, how do you see competitors' behavior [ph]?\nDarren Woods: Sure, yes, this is obviously a real important focus area for us. And I may just maybe start with a broad strategy and philosophy that you've seen us executing here over the last five years. And as I mentioned on CNBC this morning, I think we see that paying off with respect to the profit margins and the improvements that we're seeing in the profit margins. If we look at 2012, when we had extremely -- our last -- higher revenues than we've got today, we made more money this year with less revenues and that's really a function of the improvement in net profit margin, where we went from about 10% net profit margin in 2012 to 14% in 2022. So, I think a reflection of the work that we've been doing to better position ourselves competitively. If I go down each of the sectors that we're in, I'll start with the upstream where our emphasis has really been making sure that our -- projects that we're pursuing are advantage versus industry and very importantly, are on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. So, our strategy there is we can't call the cycles, we can't predict where the markets will go and over what timeframe. But we can control the cost of the barrels that we're bringing on and making sure that irrespective of the environment that we find ourselves in, that we are competitively positioned, versus our competition, that and that our barrels are lower cost. And that's been the strategy and then for the portfolio, where we don't see some of those advantages is to exit those businesses in the hybrid portfolio. That's what we've been doing. I think you're seeing the benefits of that. We've also been very focused on kind of leaning in when others lean out to use the language I used in the press release and that that I think, is paying off as well. And I think resource owners around the world recognize our commitment to that industry and our capabilities with respect to effectively producing barrels. So, I think that's what we're doing there, I think we're very well-positioned. We got a really good portfolio, I think, competitive advantage portfolio. And not only in the cost of supply, but in the quantity and the quality of the projects that we've got there. In the Chemical business, it's really around focused on performance project -- products and making sure that we're leveraging our technology to develop products that have a high value to customers and therefore a higher margin. We build world-scale facilities, start them out on commodity grades, and then quickly upgrade those and fill -- transition to performance products. That strategy continues to play out well. We're continuing to see a lot of poll on our performance products and so that's our strategy there and we continue to invest in that high-end high-value product slate in the Chemical business. In refining, it's really around evolving the yield and the products that we make in our plants. I think contrary to maybe some of the conventional wisdom out there, we actually think the refineries that we're investing in position as well for again, a very uncertain future continuing to make the products that society meets needs today and doing that across a very diversified slate of products. So, think chemicals, fuels products, and lubricants. And then at the same time investing to produce low emissions fuels to address the low carbon demand. And as that piece of the market picks up, we've got a really good competitively advantaged base to shift that production. And you see us doing that the Strathcona project is one example. But we have many, many other concepts in mind to transition, our refinery production in line with that demand evolution. And it's really just a function of pacing. And again, I think that advantages versus the rest of competition, big refining footprint that's going to be needed for these heavy advantaged in making low emissions fuel. So, I think we're well-positioned there. Our Chemical business is well-positioned with the technology and the performance products that were making. So, think we've got a leg up in that space. And then finally low carbon solutions, there's a lot of activity in this space, a lot of interest, particularly with the IRA here in the US. But more generally, around the world, I think, a real focus on low carbon opportunities. I think we're very well-positioned there. This is not a game for startups. This is -- these are large world-scale projects that require the kind of project expertise that we have require the kind of size and balance sheet capacity that we have, requires the technology and operating experience that we have. So, there's a lot of, I'd say, skills and capabilities needed in this market that lend themselves and are consistent with our capabilities and advantages. So, I think it'll take a while for that to shake out, but I am convinced that we are very well competitively positioned in the low carbon solutions business. And if you think about security of supply and counting on your partner to say sequester carbon for 100 plus years, I think you're going to want somebody who's been around for a while and knows how to do that. I think we're the company to do that. If you want somebody who's going to guarantee that when they say they're going to have the barrels available to you, they're there. I think people will look to ExxonMobil to deliver on that. I feel pretty good about our position as well.\nAlastair Syme: Thanks very much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Alastair.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI\nStephen Richardson: Thanks. Couple for Kathy, if I may. One is wondered if you could just address the balance sheet and how we're thinking about the differences in the cycle. So, obviously, significant deleveraging and at 5% net debt to cap, I know that's not your target, but it is notable. So, just wondering if you could address at what point do you start to think of the balance sheet as a bit of a drag and also your willingness to kind of continue to delever here acknowledging that there was a long time in the corporation's history where the balance sheet was effectively unlevered? Thank you.\nKathryn Mikells: So, I would start by saying we view our balance sheet very much as a competitive advantage, right and we know that during the upper part of the cycle, we've got to build a fortress balance sheet, to make sure we have all the firepower we need, and all the flexibility we need to then manage the downturn, which will inevitably come. So, that's how we think about the balance sheet. I think we've made terrific progress. I mean, if you look overall, this year, we paid down about $7 billion of debt, you already mentioned that our net debt to cap is about 5%. We obviously also learned a number of lessons during the pandemic and we have said, we have a willingness to carry a higher cash balance. Our cash balance is around $30 billion right now. So, I'd say overall, at any given point in time, our cash balance is ultimately going to depend on how the market environment ensues. But we know having a really strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage for us. We've been very clear about our capital allocation priorities and at the very top of that priority list is making sure we're consistently investing in advantaged projects, right. We're in a quite good position in terms of having a very rich portfolio of advantage projects, which we're bringing forward. And I think we've taken a very balanced approach and ultimately how we're sharing our rewards with shareholders in 2022, we ended up distributing about $15 billion in dividends and $15 billion in a share repurchase program. So, ensuring that we just have sustainable growing competitive dividends and efficiently returning cash to shareholders. So, that's how we think about it. And we are at the part of the cycle where you would expect us to see a very strong balance sheet, and we're very focused on ensuring that that's indeed what we have.\nOperator: We'll got next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nDarren Woods: Morning Sam.\nSam Margolin: I'll ask about M&A actually, because you're describing a number of advantages that are that are very unique to ExxonMobil, not just at a corporate level, but even in individual asset classes, for example, that you might be in the early stages of efficiency and productivity gains in the Permian, which is really different than a lot of other operators are saying. So, it seems like a opportunity to consolidate and create a lot of value, but at the same time, there's other countervailing forces against that. So, maybe at this point, it would be it'd be great to just hear your thoughts on the overall M&A landscape and what kind of opportunities you see? And then also in the context of Kathy's comments on the balance sheet, which is obviously set up very well right now. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. Thanks Sam, I'll touch on that and maybe -- see if Kathy has got anything to add. I think the point that you make is exactly the right one, which is looking at where we can take advantage of our capabilities and skills to bring additional value to acquisition targets. And that's really where we put our focus is where can we leverage what we what we're good at and bring value above and beyond what potential acquisition would be able to do without us. That's the focus area. And I think we are in the area that you talked about, we do think with time, the work we've been doing in the Permian will provide a value opportunity that we can leverage when we win the markets, right. And I think expectations start to align around values from a buyer standpoint, as well as a seller standpoint. And so there's an element of that where it's difficult to go in and buy at the top of a commodity cycle. You tend to want to -- at least I want to focus in on when you when you see more, I'd say longer term price cycles being priced into assets, that'll be one of the functions or one of the things that you've got to consider in this space. But it really is we continue to look for where we see the opportunity of bringing value for undeveloped resources in the Permian. I think in a Low Carbon Solutions space, it's a very early business, there aren't a whole lot of opportunities there in that space, but with time that could develop and, obviously, it's challenged in the Chemical space with respect to the technology that we bring to bear on existing assets, but it's something that we continue to look at. Kathy anything to add there?\nKathryn Mikells: The only other thing I would add is ultimately, we're focused on continuing to high-grade our portfolio overall. And you would have seen in the past year, in what's been a more buoyant market environment, you know that we've made a number of divestments where others saw more value in those assets than we saw. So, we're always looking at both sides of this equation. And depending on the market and what's available, and again, how we think about synergies, how we think about retention value, we'll look to transact, but only when we think it's going to earn good return for our shareholders.\nSam Margolin: Thank you so much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Morning, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is for Kathy, just on a couple of items that I think impacted 4Q earnings. You had highlighted on the last earnings call that downstream trading benefits were particularly strong in 3Q and I was wondering if that continued into the fourth quarter? And you also highlighted in the 8-K for 4Q earnings that inventory impacts would be a headwind and that was hoping if you could quantify that as well? Thanks.\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. And so we obviously in the third quarter quantified that we had a number of favorable timing impacts that we didn't necessarily think we're going to repeat. So, what when you think about Energy Products performance in this quarter, you should think about the absence of some of those positives that we had overall last quarter, right. So, if I look at that just on a quarterly basis, overall, we had from third quarter to fourth quarter in Energy Products, unsettled derivatives of about $1 billion as a headwind, that's really the absence of largely a positive that we would have had in the third quarter. And then again, in the third quarter, we talked about the fact that we have a program associated with achieving ratable pricing in our refinery runs and that had given us, again, I'll call it benefit in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, price timing differences were negative to the tune of about $400 million. I think the most important thing, though, is to actually take a step back and look at the full year results because what we've told you during the year is, look, we're going to have these price timing impacts, especially mark-to-market on open derivative, positions are going to move around quarter-to-quarter and during the year. But if you looked at Energy Products on a full year basis, our unsettled derivatives were basically neutral, right? And price timing impacts, and again, I would have referred to this coming largely out of our priced inventory program, were about a $400 million negative when we look at just 2021 to 2022. So, like we have said all along, the quarter-to-quarter impact may be a little bit more volatile. But when you look at the full year results, it tends to settle itself out.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. And then on the inventory, the year-end inventory impacts?\nKathryn Mikells: If you looked at overall year-end inventory impacts, they would have had the biggest impact in our Upstream business. And as part of the inventory adjustments we made, we had to look at gas inventories overall in Europe with prices declining pretty significantly. If you looked at our overall year-end adjustments to inventory outside of that, I would have called them kind of neutral to modestly favorable with the largest favorability incurring in Energy Products.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. Thanks. And then my follow-up is just on downstream maintenance, which it seems like refining maintenance will be particularly high in 1Q. I wonder if that's just kind of a bunch of things getting -- just getting aggregated into one quarter, if it's going to be a higher year overall moving through the year, if there's something else going on. Just a little more color on that number and the outlook for the year would be great. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I'll take that one. I would just say turnaround timing is really a function of -- and the spend that we have in that area is really a function of the mix and the units that we're bringing in at the different -- into turnarounds around the different refineries and the age of those units. And so I wouldn't take away some structural change or outlook for the year. It's really just a function of which refineries and which units that those refineries are coming into turnaround and the work that we have to do to get those units back on their maintenance schedule. So, that's what's happening there.\nJason Gabelman: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Hey thanks. Maybe a higher-level question, following up on some of your comments earlier on competitive position. Relative to past cycles, the competitive environment in upstream oil looks far different than many times in the past with both fewer players in the industry and many of your largest peers strategically under-investing in oil. How does it -- how do you think this impacts global supply over time? And how does it impact your -- as you look forward, how does it impact your competitive position within the space? Does it open the door for additional opportunities for you? And in E&P projects, does it -- whether in terms of expiration leasehold, competition or project development or even within the asset transactions in the M&A space, have you seen an impact to-date? And how do you think that evolves in the coming years with the changed competitive landscape?\nDarren Woods: Yes, thanks. I'll take that one, Ryan. It's -- I think you hit on a very good point, which is -- and the point that we've made historically is there has -- we are under-investing as an industry in this space. And in the depletion business, we are not keeping up with that depletion or not offsetting it and covering the growth. You find yourself in tight markets. And I think as the broader public narrative has moved in this space and some of our competitors have stepped back for investment there, that does tighten the amount of capacity that's coming on and the supply that gets brought in on over time. And until you have competitive alternatives, lower emissions, competitive alternatives that address the full set of needs for society, there's going to continue to be a demand for oil and gas and oil products. And so I think you're seeing the potential for continued tight markets. I think we have found, certainly over the last five years, that our continued commitment to strengthening the capabilities that will allow us to bring on competitively sourced oil and gas and do that in an environmentally responsible way, that, that has resonated and is being recognized by resource owners around the world. And so I do think that does give us a bit of an advantage with respect to the opportunity set. And I would say that we continue to work to earn the advantage by developing those resources very effectively, bringing projects on ahead of schedule, under budget and doing things that, frankly, some of our competitors are challenged to do. And so I think it's a very supportive environment that we find ourselves in. The focus that we have in this space, I think, is appreciated and gives us an advantage versus the rest of the competition. And I'll also add that we're doing that while, at the same time, balancing the risk of the transition and investing in the low emission side of the equation. And so we've got this unique position where the same core capabilities that we're using to drive value in our traditional businesses, we're using those and leveraging them to drive value in the Low Carbon Solutions business and keeping a very keen eye on the developments in all those industries and making sure that we adjust our investments in our strategy and our allocation of capital based on the developments that we're seeing in those space. So, we've got optionality and we've got flexibility. And we've got a core set of competencies that lend themselves to every part of that -- of those businesses and across our portfolio. So, I feel really good about that. And I think the folks that were out there or the partners that we're looking to partner with recognize that and value it. So, I think we'll see that manifest itself in the deals that we continue to do and the businesses that we continue to grow.\nRyan Todd: Thanks Darren.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the Beaumont expansion and how the ramp is going there. And in terms of profitability, we've got Midland trading above Cushing now, but that's probably not significant given diesel cracks are very, very strong. So, just wondering on the profitability of that project out of the gate relative to how you've been thinking about it when you sanctioned?\nDarren Woods: Yes, I'll take it. As I said before, if you look at Beaumont, when we -- the concept of that project was developed five-plus years ago. And it really was looking at what I would call the feedstocks and intermediate balances going into that refinery and the options that we had to optimize the logistics piece of the equation and justified that project purely on logistics optimizations and lower-cost transportation to feed that refinery. And that's kind of how we thought about that, so that is robust to wherever you're at within the cycle. If you layer on where we're at today in the commodity cycle and the fact that we are at on the very high end of refining margins, my expectation is that that refining expansion will do much, much better than what we -- the basis on which we appropriate it just because we find the timing of where we find ourselves in that cycle. And that's good news. I mean that's, I think, an important part of the investments that we make to make sure that we're kind of participating in all phases of the cycle. But I think even better news is we're not depending on that to generate a return from that investment. So, even as we move through the commodity cycle and at some point in the future, we find refining margins start to come off, and eventually, we'll find ourselves in the bottom of the refining commodity cycle. That expansion will position our Beaumont refinery very well and will, I think, continue to be incremental to the value of that refinery. So, feel really positive about that. We're making good progress. We mechanically completed that a little ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on ramping that facility up.\nJennifer Driscoll: We have time for one more question.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: Looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question will be from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes, thank you and good morning. Glad you're able to port me in here. Just wanted to follow-up on Guyana. I think there was a lot of expectation at the Investor Day -- well, won't be an Investor Day, but there'd be a potentially big update on Guyana. I know things are going well there from a development standpoint, but I was just hoping you could address anything on the resource side and any update at all from a PSC political side, there's been a little noise out there on that end?\nDarren Woods: Yes, I think the point you made, we're making really good progress. As we've said, we brought Liza 2 in ahead of schedule. We anticipate bringing Payara in ahead of schedule. We brought Liza 2 up very well, brought that online quickly and began producing at above nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. And so I feel really good about the quality of those projects and the operational ability to bring those up and run them effectively, making good progress there. We've got Yellowtail in for government approval. I expect that to be a bigger FPSO. So, we're making -- I would say we're at or ahead of the schedule and ahead of the expectations that we've talked about historically with Guyana. The resource base, as you know, continues to grow. We continue to make discoveries. We continue to really optimize around those discoveries. And that's a really big part of developing these projects is as we are in parallel to developing projects, continuing the exploration and then continuing to better quantify and qualify that resource base is making sure that our projects are optimized around that. So, there's a balance that we're striking around how best to optimize, and feel good about what we're doing there. And frankly, I think the government feels really good about what we're doing there. Importantly, the development of that resource and the value associated with that is manifesting itself in the country, which is a really important part of the equation here. We always said coming into this that this has to be a win-win-win proposition, needs to be a win for the company, it needs to be a win for the government of Guyana and it needs to be a win for the people of Guyana. And that's what we're seeing there, a lot of jobs, a lot of economic opportunity opening up in Guyana. We've just -- we've been working with the Guyanese government around a project to bring in gas power into the country, lower emissions and more reliable. We've got work going on to help bring up some of the other social services in the country. So, I think people are seeing the progress. And the fact that we're bringing this on sooner and at lower cost, I think, is a benefit to the government. They recognize the values coming faster than originally anticipated. So, it's a -- I think it's a good story of government, I think, and ExxonMobil, got very good relationships, working very constructively. And as I said, it's a win-win-win proposition here and feel good about the progress we're making.\nRoger Read: And any thoughts on the resource base or the next time you'll offer an update on that?\nDarren Woods: I think as the team continues to drill and then quantify and characterize the results of those drills, when it gets to a material improvement, we'll be out talking about that.\nRoger Read: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Roger, thank you.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our investor website by the end of the week. Have a nice day, everyone. And I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Kathryn Mikells",
            "content": "Just the other thing I would add is I'd really caution you about taking the fourth quarter CapEx and exploration expense and kind of annualizing it because we tend to run a bit higher in the fourth quarter and the expenses and kind of prorated over the years. Overall, 2022 came in right about where we expected it. And when we talked about our Corporate Plan in December, we said we expect it to be at about $23 billion to $25 billion in 2023. And that we expected to see a little bit of an increase year-over-year, in part because Payara has been pulled forward, so we have a little more spending there. China One is starting to spool up and obviously, our emission plans are also spooling up. So, right now I'd say we're very consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we've given you. Sure. So, I'll first I'll first just talk about the financial impacts. In the current quarter, we wouldn't have had material impacts. Obviously, there were some countries in Europe that had passed incremental taxes earlier this year. So, I'll point to Italy and the UK, as an example. And so we would have been accruing those appropriately. You would have seen as part of our identified items that we booked $1.8 billion associated with 2022. Overall, increased additional European taxes. Now, in terms of the cash impact that doesn't really hit in 2022, we just took the we took the overall accrual and those payments will end up occurring both in 2023 and in 2024. It just depends on the individual countries. But if I take an overall step back and say we looked at what happened in the EU and said, it's not legal and it's the opposite of what is needed, right. So, what's needed right now is more supply and instead, what's been put in place is a penalty on the broad energy sector. So, I'll contrast that with what's happened more recently in the United States with the Inflation Reduction Act, right. There you see policy that's put out to incent industry, both to accelerate technology and decelerate investment, that's greatly needed, especially in areas where the industries in terms of lowering emissions are still pretty nascent, things like hydrogen and CCS, and you're already seeing investment start to flow into those industries. So, I would start by saying we view our balance sheet very much as a competitive advantage, right and we know that during the upper part of the cycle, we've got to build a fortress balance sheet, to make sure we have all the firepower we need, and all the flexibility we need to then manage the downturn, which will inevitably come. So, that's how we think about the balance sheet. I think we've made terrific progress. I mean, if you look overall, this year, we paid down about $7 billion of debt, you already mentioned that our net debt to cap is about 5%. We obviously also learned a number of lessons during the pandemic and we have said, we have a willingness to carry a higher cash balance. Our cash balance is around $30 billion right now. So, I'd say overall, at any given point in time, our cash balance is ultimately going to depend on how the market environment ensues. But we know having a really strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage for us. We've been very clear about our capital allocation priorities and at the very top of that priority list is making sure we're consistently investing in advantaged projects, right. We're in a quite good position in terms of having a very rich portfolio of advantage projects, which we're bringing forward. And I think we've taken a very balanced approach and ultimately how we're sharing our rewards with shareholders in 2022, we ended up distributing about $15 billion in dividends and $15 billion in a share repurchase program. So, ensuring that we just have sustainable growing competitive dividends and efficiently returning cash to shareholders. So, that's how we think about it. And we are at the part of the cycle where you would expect us to see a very strong balance sheet, and we're very focused on ensuring that that's indeed what we have. The only other thing I would add is ultimately, we're focused on continuing to high-grade our portfolio overall. And you would have seen in the past year, in what's been a more buoyant market environment, you know that we've made a number of divestments where others saw more value in those assets than we saw. So, we're always looking at both sides of this equation. And depending on the market and what's available, and again, how we think about synergies, how we think about retention value, we'll look to transact, but only when we think it's going to earn good return for our shareholders. Yes. And so we obviously in the third quarter quantified that we had a number of favorable timing impacts that we didn't necessarily think we're going to repeat.

            "content": "Thanks Jennifer. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Before covering our 2022 results, I want to start by recognizing our people. Their hard work and commitment, not only to the company, but to meeting the critical needs of society, are what drove the strong results we reported this morning. Their work is not easy, whether it's achieving industry-leading safety, driving record levels of environmental performance, increasing production, offsetting run-away inflation, effectively responding to expropriations, or quickly recovering from winter storms, to name just a few of the challenges, our people delivered while, I'll add, continuing to manage significant, ongoing organizational changes. As I cover our results, I think you'll see why we, and the entire management team are so proud of their efforts. Of course, our results clearly benefited from a favorable market but, to take full advantage of the undersupplied market, our work began years ago, well before the pandemic when we chose to invest counter-cyclically. We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom. We continued with these investments through the pandemic and into today. This year, our improved asset portfolio, organizational changes, and strong operating performance came together to deliver industry-leading results; industry-leading earnings, cash flows, return on capital employed, and total shareholder returns. Excluding asset sales, we had our best cash flow performance since the merger. And, despite lower revenues, we delivered higher profits than 2012, our previous record year with a 400-basis point improvement in profit margin, reflecting upgrades to our product mix, structural cost reductions, and disciplined expense management. 2022 was also a year of strong progress across our five strategic priorities. Importantly, we've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian at a time when the world needed it most. We implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage our scale and integration, improve effectiveness, and better serve our customers. We combined our downstream and chemical companies to form Product Solutions, the world's largest fuels, chemicals, and lubricants business. This new integrated business is focused on developing high value products, improving portfolio value, and leading in sustainability. We're also now supporting our businesses with corporate-wide organizations including projects, technology, engineering, operations, safety, and sustainability. We see further opportunities in supply chain, procurement, and finance. We continued to expand our Low Carbon Solutions business, recently signing the first-of-its kind customer contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This agreement, in a hard-to-decarbonize sector, highlights how ExxonMobil can leverage our advantages to help others reduce their emissions and build an attractive business with strong returns and significant opportunities for growth. The recent passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes both hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, further reinforces this. To that end, in December, we shared our plans to invest approximately $17 billion in lower-emission opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in our prior plan. We also made significant progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our existing operations and remain on track with our 2030 emissions reduction plans, including net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. In addition to investing in industry advantaged projects, we took advantage of the strong markets to further high grade our asset portfolio with approximately $5 billion in divestments of non-core assets. CapEx was in line with our guidance. To further increase transparency, in 2022, we introduced three new reports; The Lobbying Report, which provides additional disclosure of our lobbying activities and expenditures; The Climate Lobbying Report, which provides details on our US activities at the federal and state level; and our Investing in People supplement, an addition to our updated Sustainability Report. Lastly, as I mentioned, the hard work of our people underpinned our success this past year, as it has done for decades. We build on this advantage every year by attracting and developing the best talent. This past year, we were once again recognized as top in industry for most attractive employer among US engineering students, an honor we've received 10 years in a row. Our 2022 financial results, which led the industry, further confirmed the strength of the strategy we developed five years ago. We grew earnings to nearly $56 billion -- $59 billion excluding identified items; significantly outpacing peers. We delivered an industry-leading total shareholder return of 87% and a return on capital employed of 25%, our highest one-year ROCE since 2012. Cash flow from operating activities was nearly $77 billion, also leading the industry. This enabled us to reduce net debt to 5%, fortifying the balance sheet and positioning us to continue our strategy of counter cyclically investing. Our continued focus on leveraging scale and integration drove further efficiencies with nearly $6.9 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019, up from $5.3 billion at the end of 2021. We remain on plan to meet our target of $9 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2023. Consistent with our capital-allocation strategy, we continue to share our success with shareholders through a reliable and growing dividend. In 2022, we boosted the quarterly dividend by more than 3% and marked the 40th consecutive annual increase. Additionally, we increased our share repurchase program twice during the year. In total, we returned $30 billion to shareholders in 2022, including about $15 billion in dividends, which also led peers. These actions reflect the confidence we have in our strategy, the performance we've seen across our businesses, and the strength of our company's future. We're proud of our people and their work to meet the evolving needs of society. As we advance our strategy and the and equation, we're committed to sharing their progress. Consistent with this, we continue to enhance our disclosures and increase transparency. In December, we updated several important online publications. Our latest Sustainability Report describes the 14 focus areas where we believe our company can have the most impact. The Advancing Climate Solutions 2023 Progress Report outlines our approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net-zero future. It includes updated resiliency modeling under the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, including the addition of carbon and pricing assumptions, and an audit statement from Wood Mackenzie. In addition, it includes a discussion on the value of a life-cycle approach to measuring company specific emissions vs. Scope 3 targets. We believe a life-cycle approach for companies is more aligned with the principles of ESG, better reflects a company's efforts to reduce society's emissions, and avoids the negative consequences of a company-specific Scope 3 target. The update also contains more information on how we're driving reductions in methane emissions. And finally, it includes a look at the role of plastics in the energy transition, and how we're expanding our capacity for advanced recycling to help address the issue of plastic waste. Separately, we've updated our outlook for energy, which is our latest view of energy supply and demand through 2050. It forms the basis for our business planning. In addition to assessing trends in economic development, technology advances, and consumer behavior, our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often target specific sectors. We encourage you to read these publications to gain a better understanding of how we're working to be a leader in the energy transition. They're available on our website under the Sustainability tab. Our plan for 2023 remains anchored in our existing strategy and builds on our continuing success. I'll wrap up by highlighting a few key areas. Critically, we'll continue our efforts to lead the industry in safety, operating, and financial performance. We'll continue to profitably grow the business through advantaged investments to meet the world's evolving needs and reduce emissions. We'll further leverage our new organization to fully realize our advantages in scale and integration and improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver another $2 billion in structural cost reductions, meeting our target of $9 billion in savings versus 2019. We'll look to capture additional organizational synergies by consolidating our supply chain activities and centralizing a majority of our finance and procurement operations. This will help us take better advantage of our scale and greatly improve our customer, vendor, and employee experience. We anticipate 2023 capital and exploration expenses of $23 billion to $25 billion. This includes investments in the next development in Guyana, and increased spending in US unconventional assets. It also includes advancing our China chemical complex and numerous emission reduction opportunities. We'll advance our work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity in our operated assets and help customers reduce theirs focusing on hard to decarbonize sectors. We'll continue to progress our blue hydrogen project in Baytown, that consists of a billion cubic foot per day blue hydrogen plant, the world's largest, and a CCS project with potential to store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year. We'll also leverage our recent success in Louisiana to grow the customer base for our Low Carbon Solutions business. As the energy system evolves, our focus on the fundamentals and investments in an integrated but diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses will play a crucial role in capturing value and outperforming competition irrespective of the pace or path of the transition. As you've seen, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities: investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage across the commodity cycles, and sharing our success through shareholder distributions. We've demonstrated our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and further sharing our success through the share repurchase program with up to $35 billion in cumulative repurchases in 2023 and 2024. 2022 demonstrated the importance of the and equation and the strength of our strategy. We feel good about the progress we've made and even better about the opportunities ahead. With that, let me call over to Jennifer. Yes, good morning Biraj. Let me start with your last question and then move to the first. With respect to CapEx, if you look at the range we've given, I think we've indicated in the comments and I just -- the comments I just made that we'll be at the upper end of that range, which is consistent with a slight increase given the work that we're doing. But I would reiterate that the broader range that we've given over the years continues to fit well with our plans and is consistent with the pacing that we established when we came out of the pandemic. As I mentioned before, we had worked with our contractors to lay out a plan for how we continue to progress those investments. And I would tell you today with our projects organization feel really good about the progress we're making, the efficiencies that we're gaining with our CapEx. If you look at the pause that we had to take due to the pandemic, we basically offset any of those costs to maintain the same level of productivity of our spend going forwards. So, something real proud of the projects organization is doing. So, I would expect to continue to stay within that range. And if that changes, obviously, in the years to come, we'll update you as our plans develop and make sure you all stay aware of that. With respect to the inflation, I would say, from an operating expense standpoint, one point I'd make is if you look at what the organization did year-on-year, essentially, with all the synergies that we are capturing, some of the scale advantages and purchasing power we had, essentially, the businesses collectively came in on plants. We're able to offset the inflation that we were seeing from an expense standpoint, which was obviously no easy task. I think on the -- if you look at the different projects around the world, it really is a function of when we chose to engage the contractors and engage the equipment that we're using. I mean, if you look at the Permian, it's the short cycle and where there's a lot of activity. And so like other parts of our business, supply and demand gets tight and puts pressure on pricing, there's less of that supply/demand pressure in other parts of the business and so not seeing the same kind of pressure that we're seeing in the Permian, that tends to be the one area that's really, really hot. But I think in all those areas, we're using the size of the business that we have and the long-term plans that we have and long-term commitments that we can make with our contracting partners to make sure that we're keeping those in check and that our partners are playing the long game here with us. So, I think we've done a pretty good job of keeping capital productivity pretty high, feel pretty good about that. Kathy, anything you want to add? Sure. Good morning Jeanine. Yes, I'll take that Jeanine. I think -- start with just the market in general and I think the driver behind the refining margins that we've seen here of late is driven by the pandemic impacts of shutting down capacity and then not having that capacity available as demand has recovered. So, the world remains pretty tight and it will stay I think tight, while we wait for additional refinery expansions to come online, primarily out in Asia and the Middle East. I think the Russia impact and the ban on products going into Europe could potentially have some short-term implications. At the end of the day that -- those products are going to be needed. So, it really is around logistics, I'll call it, disoptimization to where the market is pretty efficient and we've got the most efficient supply chains and logistics systems lined out. We're going to disrupt those and I think it's a question of how does that disruption manifest itself in the market and what kind of disconnects and discontinuities do you see in the short-term? And then ultimately, we'll read that -- the system will stabilize, reoptimize and I expect higher costs just because of your moving to a less optimum logistics approach, but more stable. I don't know -- that's -- that -- I see how that's going to play out. So, I don't think there'll be a long-term impact, it'll be a short-term one and then there's just a question how long it takes for the systems to rebalance. I think more fundamental to refining is the shortness and with the economies picking up and with China coming out of its COVID lockdown and the economic growth there and then the view that you take on the economic impacts and how severe recessions are here this year, that's probably going to play a much bigger role. If demand picks up, economies continue to grow, we're going to see that tightness manifests itself and continued higher refining margins, which I think will mean a fairly high margins this year and potentially going into 2024 as well. Sure. Yes, thanks, Neil. I would take you back to 2018 when we were talking about our strategy in the Permian and we've said at that time, our plan was to grow to 1 million barrels a day of production by 2025. When the pandemic hit, we basically said, there's going to be a delay in a lot of our plans and pushed out those objectives by about two years. So, moving from 2025 to 2027. If you'll look at my comments and the plans, we're now forecasting that our Permian production will reach about 1 million barrels a day by 2027. So, very much in line, going all the way back to 2018. And then the comments that we made around the pandemic and the delay that I was introducing. So, I think that's the context to think about what we're doing in the Permian and that development. If you look at 2021, we added about 90,000 barrels a day of production. 2022, very similar number, 90,000 barrels a day. And that in part was what I'd call, the organic development and drilling into production as well as clearing our DUCs inventory. So, as we were in the pandemic, obviously, not a lot of incentive to bring production on and so we concentrated our spend on drilling. And then as we got into higher-priced environments, concentrated on clearing that inventory and bringing those wells to production, and so we were bringing our DUC inventory down. As we go into next year, we're going to rebuild that inventory, get to an optimum level that we can then use and maintain as we go through the next several years. So, that's kind of a strategy of how we're working out. If you think about, ultimately getting to 1 million barrels a day by 2027, that's roughly at 13% compounded annual growth rate. That's going to -- that's not going to be steady every year, that'll kind of fluctuate, call it, plus or minus 5%. That's kind of order of magnitude how we'll see that playing out. And any one year's production will be a function of the development plans we have and how those development plans manifest themselves in that specific timeframe. But I think bottom-line is we're basically on plan moving at the pace that we anticipated. And I'm hopeful that as we continue to focus on the technology developments and continuing to improve efficiency, we'll see either that production bottom-line with more effectively at lower cost, or in fact, more productivity and higher production. But that's a function of the ongoing work we've got to bring our technology and operational capabilities to bear in the Permian continue to improve what we're doing there. Morning. Yes, sure. I think maybe just take both sides of the equation with Chemicals. I'll start with the demand side of the equation, which you referenced and you're right. I think one of the things we saw last year was with the China lockdowns and the lack of growth in China, which is a big, as you know, chemical market that that had an impact on the demand side of the equation. My expectation as we move into this year and the China economy continues to open up, we'll see that demand pick back up again. And then again, a function of whether how deep and how widespread the recessions are around the world, that's going to have an impact. If current conventions and thinking holds and recessions are milder than people anticipated, I think that'll see a benefit in the chemical on the demand side as well. From a supply side, which is a big part of what's suppressing margins today, as we came out -- went into the pandemic, there were a lot of chemical projects that got put on hold and deferred investments. And you're now seeing as we came out of the pandemic and you look at margins in 2021, 2022, very strong chemical margins, we saw those investments get leaned into and a lot of that capacity coming online. So, we've got this a large capacity additions coming on at the same time where we've had some demand slowdown. So, I think what we're seeing play out here is that what I would say is the typical supply/demand swings in that commodity cycle exacerbated somewhat by the effects of the pandemic, still kind of playing itself out, but not inconsistent with what we had anticipated coming out of the pandemic. And so it'll be -- it'll take a little time for that demand to pick up and fill that capacity, but it will get back on the growth trajectory, markets will get tight again. So, that's how we're thinking about the Chemical business. With respect to our projects, feel really good about -- we had to pause those, as you know coming out of the pandemic where we had to make some tough choices about how we spend our capital. We'd never done that before in terms of stopping some projects in midstream. But I again, I'll tell you the organization did a great job of putting those on pause, preserving where we're at, continuing to work with contractors to drive efficiency, and now we're bringing those back on basically in line with the plans that we've laid out in the pandemic. We just brought on the polypropylene unit in Baton Rouge. We've got our Baytown Vistamaxx, and LAO projects, which we anticipate coming on here middle of this year, and then China One is making really good progress and expect that to come on in 2025. So, I think all those investments we feel really good about and are on the path that we had anticipated. You bet. Morning Doug. And I would just add, Doug, I think, obviously, we're -- we've been engaged with governments throughout Europe. And I do think there is a sensitivity to the impact on future investments and industries' appetite to continue to invest in what is a challenging market environment in the first place with respect to Europe, becoming more uncertain and less stable. So, I think there was some concern going into this and my suspicion will be many in industry, this will be yet another reason to pull back on their investments in Europe. And I'm not sure you're going to then see that begin to propagate around the world just because of the negative impact it has on an industry that requires stable policy and some certainty when you're making the size of investments that the industry makes over the time horizon that we make them in. So, my sense is that there will be a lot of unintended negative consequences that come from this and as that manifest itself, a lot less appetite for doing this. Sure, yes, this is obviously a real important focus area for us. And I may just maybe start with a broad strategy and philosophy that you've seen us executing here over the last five years. And as I mentioned on CNBC this morning, I think we see that paying off with respect to the profit margins and the improvements that we're seeing in the profit margins. If we look at 2012, when we had extremely -- our last -- higher revenues than we've got today, we made more money this year with less revenues and that's really a function of the improvement in net profit margin, where we went from about 10% net profit margin in 2012 to 14% in 2022. So, I think a reflection of the work that we've been doing to better position ourselves competitively. If I go down each of the sectors that we're in, I'll start with the upstream where our emphasis has really been making sure that our -- projects that we're pursuing are advantage versus industry and very importantly, are on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. So, our strategy there is we can't call the cycles, we can't predict where the markets will go and over what timeframe. But we can control the cost of the barrels that we're bringing on and making sure that irrespective of the environment that we find ourselves in, that we are competitively positioned, versus our competition, that and that our barrels are lower cost. And that's been the strategy and then for the portfolio, where we don't see some of those advantages is to exit those businesses in the hybrid portfolio. That's what we've been doing. I think you're seeing the benefits of that. We've also been very focused on kind of leaning in when others lean out to use the language I used in the press release and that that I think, is paying off as well. And I think resource owners around the world recognize our commitment to that industry and our capabilities with respect to effectively producing barrels. So, I think that's what we're doing there, I think we're very well-positioned. We got a really good portfolio, I think, competitive advantage portfolio. And not only in the cost of supply, but in the quantity and the quality of the projects that we've got there. In the Chemical business, it's really around focused on performance project -- products and making sure that we're leveraging our technology to develop products that have a high value to customers and therefore a higher margin. We build world-scale facilities, start them out on commodity grades, and then quickly upgrade those and fill -- transition to performance products. That strategy continues to play out well. We're continuing to see a lot of poll on our performance products and so that's our strategy there and we continue to invest in that high-end high-value product slate in the Chemical business. In refining, it's really around evolving the yield and the products that we make in our plants. I think contrary to maybe some of the conventional wisdom out there, we actually think the refineries that we're investing in position as well for again, a very uncertain future continuing to make the products that society meets needs today and doing that across a very diversified slate of products. So, think chemicals, fuels products, and lubricants. And then at the same time investing to produce low emissions fuels to address the low carbon demand. And as that piece of the market picks up, we've got a really good competitively advantaged base to shift that production. And you see us doing that the Strathcona project is one example. But we have many, many other concepts in mind to transition, our refinery production in line with that demand evolution. And it's really just a function of pacing. And again, I think that advantages versus the rest of competition, big refining footprint that's going to be needed for these heavy advantaged in making low emissions fuel. So, I think we're well-positioned there. Our Chemical business is well-positioned with the technology and the performance products that were making. So, think we've got a leg up in that space. And then finally low carbon solutions, there's a lot of activity in this space, a lot of interest, particularly with the IRA here in the US. But more generally, around the world, I think, a real focus on low carbon opportunities. I think we're very well-positioned there. This is not a game for startups. This is -- these are large world-scale projects that require the kind of project expertise that we have require the kind of size and balance sheet capacity that we have, requires the technology and operating experience that we have. So, there's a lot of, I'd say, skills and capabilities needed in this market that lend themselves and are consistent with our capabilities and advantages. So, I think it'll take a while for that to shake out, but I am convinced that we are very well competitively positioned in the low carbon solutions business. And if you think about security of supply and counting on your partner to say sequester carbon for 100 plus years, I think you're going to want somebody who's been around for a while and knows how to do that. I think we're the company to do that. If you want somebody who's going to guarantee that when they say they're going to have the barrels available to you, they're there. I think people will look to ExxonMobil to deliver on that. I feel pretty good about our position as well. Thank you, Alastair. Morning Sam. Yes, sure. Thanks Sam, I'll touch on that and maybe -- see if Kathy has got anything to add. I think the point that you make is exactly the right one, which is looking at where we can take advantage of our capabilities and skills to bring additional value to acquisition targets. And that's really where we put our focus is where can we leverage what we what we're good at and bring value above and beyond what potential acquisition would be able to do without us. That's the focus area. And I think we are in the area that you talked about, we do think with time, the work we've been doing in the Permian will provide a value opportunity that we can leverage when we win the markets, right. And I think expectations start to align around values from a buyer standpoint, as well as a seller standpoint. And so there's an element of that where it's difficult to go in and buy at the top of a commodity cycle. You tend to want to -- at least I want to focus in on when you when you see more, I'd say longer term price cycles being priced into assets, that'll be one of the functions or one of the things that you've got to consider in this space. But it really is we continue to look for where we see the opportunity of bringing value for undeveloped resources in the Permian. I think in a Low Carbon Solutions space, it's a very early business, there aren't a whole lot of opportunities there in that space, but with time that could develop and, obviously, it's challenged in the Chemical space with respect to the technology that we bring to bear on existing assets, but it's something that we continue to look at. Kathy anything to add there? Thank you. Yes, I'll take that one. I would just say turnaround timing is really a function of -- and the spend that we have in that area is really a function of the mix and the units that we're bringing in at the different -- into turnarounds around the different refineries and the age of those units. And so I wouldn't take away some structural change or outlook for the year. It's really just a function of which refineries and which units that those refineries are coming into turnaround and the work that we have to do to get those units back on their maintenance schedule. So, that's what's happening there. Yes, thanks. I'll take that one, Ryan. It's -- I think you hit on a very good point, which is -- and the point that we've made historically is there has -- we are under-investing as an industry in this space. And in the depletion business, we are not keeping up with that depletion or not offsetting it and covering the growth. You find yourself in tight markets. And I think as the broader public narrative has moved in this space and some of our competitors have stepped back for investment there, that does tighten the amount of capacity that's coming on and the supply that gets brought in on over time. And until you have competitive alternatives, lower emissions, competitive alternatives that address the full set of needs for society, there's going to continue to be a demand for oil and gas and oil products. And so I think you're seeing the potential for continued tight markets. I think we have found, certainly over the last five years, that our continued commitment to strengthening the capabilities that will allow us to bring on competitively sourced oil and gas and do that in an environmentally responsible way, that, that has resonated and is being recognized by resource owners around the world. And so I do think that does give us a bit of an advantage with respect to the opportunity set. And I would say that we continue to work to earn the advantage by developing those resources very effectively, bringing projects on ahead of schedule, under budget and doing things that, frankly, some of our competitors are challenged to do. And so I think it's a very supportive environment that we find ourselves in. The focus that we have in this space, I think, is appreciated and gives us an advantage versus the rest of the competition. And I'll also add that we're doing that while, at the same time, balancing the risk of the transition and investing in the low emission side of the equation. And so we've got this unique position where the same core capabilities that we're using to drive value in our traditional businesses, we're using those and leveraging them to drive value in the Low Carbon Solutions business and keeping a very keen eye on the developments in all those industries and making sure that we adjust our investments in our strategy and our allocation of capital based on the developments that we're seeing in those space. So, we've got optionality and we've got flexibility. And we've got a core set of competencies that lend themselves to every part of that -- of those businesses and across our portfolio. So, I feel really good about that. And I think the folks that were out there or the partners that we're looking to partner with recognize that and value it. So, I think we'll see that manifest itself in the deals that we continue to do and the businesses that we continue to grow. You bet. Yes, I'll take it. As I said before, if you look at Beaumont, when we -- the concept of that project was developed five-plus years ago. And it really was looking at what I would call the feedstocks and intermediate balances going into that refinery and the options that we had to optimize the logistics piece of the equation and justified that project purely on logistics optimizations and lower-cost transportation to feed that refinery. And that's kind of how we thought about that, so that is robust to wherever you're at within the cycle. If you layer on where we're at today in the commodity cycle and the fact that we are at on the very high end of refining margins, my expectation is that that refining expansion will do much, much better than what we -- the basis on which we appropriate it just because we find the timing of where we find ourselves in that cycle. And that's good news. I mean that's, I think, an important part of the investments that we make to make sure that we're kind of participating in all phases of the cycle. But I think even better news is we're not depending on that to generate a return from that investment. So, even as we move through the commodity cycle and at some point in the future, we find refining margins start to come off, and eventually, we'll find ourselves in the bottom of the refining commodity cycle. That expansion will position our Beaumont refinery very well and will, I think, continue to be incremental to the value of that refinery. So, feel really positive about that. We're making good progress. We mechanically completed that a little ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on ramping that facility up. You bet. Yes, I think the point you made, we're making really good progress. As we've said, we brought Liza 2 in ahead of schedule. We anticipate bringing Payara in ahead of schedule. We brought Liza 2 up very well, brought that online quickly and began producing at above nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. And so I feel really good about the quality of those projects and the operational ability to bring those up and run them effectively, making good progress there. We've got Yellowtail in for government approval. I expect that to be a bigger FPSO. So, we're making -- I would say we're at or ahead of the schedule and ahead of the expectations that we've talked about historically with Guyana. The resource base, as you know, continues to grow. We continue to make discoveries. We continue to really optimize around those discoveries. And that's a really big part of developing these projects is as we are in parallel to developing projects, continuing the exploration and then continuing to better quantify and qualify that resource base is making sure that our projects are optimized around that. So, there's a balance that we're striking around how best to optimize, and feel good about what we're doing there. And frankly, I think the government feels really good about what we're doing there. Importantly, the development of that resource and the value associated with that is manifesting itself in the country, which is a really important part of the equation here. We always said coming into this that this has to be a win-win-win proposition, needs to be a win for the company, it needs to be a win for the government of Guyana and it needs to be a win for the people of Guyana. And that's what we're seeing there, a lot of jobs, a lot of economic opportunity opening up in Guyana. We've just -- we've been working with the Guyanese government around a project to bring in gas power into the country, lower emissions and more reliable. We've got work going on to help bring up some of the other social services in the country. So, I think people are seeing the progress. And the fact that we're bringing this on sooner and at lower cost, I think, is a benefit to the government. They recognize the values coming faster than originally anticipated. So, it's a -- I think it's a good story of government, I think, and ExxonMobil, got very good relationships, working very constructively. And as I said, it's a win-win-win proposition here and feel good about the progress we're making. I think as the team continues to drill and then quantify and characterize the results of those drills, when it gets to a material improvement, we'll be out talking about that. Roger, thank you."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call today at our new time of 7:30 a.m. Central. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  This live presentation, our prerecorded remarks and the news release are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from the prerecorded presentation. This allows us more time for questions before we conclude at 8:30 a.m. Central Time.  During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. For additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments, please refer to our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. Please note, we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides.  Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Before covering our earnings highlights, I want to begin by recognizing the men and women of ExxonMobil. While this quarter's results were clearly helped by a favorable market, fact is we're in this position because of the hard work and commitment of our people over the past few years. Where others pulled back in the face of uncertainty and a historic slowdown, retreating and retrenching, this company moved forward, continuing to invest and build to help meet the demands we see today and position the company for long-term success in each of our businesses.  We understand how important our role is in providing the energy and products the world needs. And while the market has clearly been a factor, results we report today reflect that deep commitment. I mentioned this because it is at the heart of our company and its culture. We know the role we play and are incredibly proud of it. We work together as a team, confident in our mission and determined to do our part in meeting the world's energy needs and leading the way in a thoughtful energy transition.  Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter operational and financial results. Higher natural gas realizations, strong refinery throughput, robust refining margins and rigorous cost control drove our earnings improvement. We continue to increase production to address the needs of consumers, which contributed to earnings and cash flow growth, a stronger balance sheet and significant value creation. Our results also reflected the outstanding work of our teams across the world who operate our facilities reliably at high utilization rates.  Let me highlight a few examples of our progress. First, Energy Products. We boosted overall refinery throughput to its highest quarterly level since 2008, responding to tight market conditions. And we continue to make progress on the Beaumont refinery expansion, which will increase capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023.  We also increased production from our high-return assets in the Permian and Guyana. Our production in the Permian Basin reached nearly 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, building on our strong growth from last year. We grew our production in Guyana to 360,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, with Liza Phase 1 and 2, both exceeding design capacity. We also had continued exploration success with 2 additional discoveries in the quarter. Earlier this month, first LNG production was achieved from Mozambique's Coral South floating LNG development, contributing new supply amid growing demand for LNG globally.  We continue to expect total upstream production of 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels per day for the year. Looking longer term, we remain on track to grow low-cost production and meet our 2027 plan, with more than 90% of our Upstream investments, generating over 10% returns at $35 per barrel.  Our ability to increase production while reducing cost, improves our competitive position, benefits consumers and generates capital to fund meaningful investments, demonstrated by one of our recent press releases, announcing that our low carbon solutions business signed its first and the largest of its kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2.  This marks an important milestone in developing our newest business. It's also a good example of how we're supporting other companies in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. We look forward to sharing more about our progress in developing attractive low-carbon solutions business in December as part of our corporate plan discussions.  We continue to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the sale of our interest in the Aera oil production operations in California and our refinery in Billings, Montana. Proceeds from divestments completed year-to-date totaled $4 billion as we captured incremental value for these noncore assets in today's higher price environment. These sales enable us to concentrate on our higher-value advantaged assets.  Finally, you may have heard earlier this month that with 2 decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated ExxonMobil's interest in Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project to a Russian operator. In March, we stated our intention to exit the Sakhalin-1 project and discontinue our role as operator and took an impairment of approximately $3.4 billion at the time.  While our affiliate was in force majeure due to the unprecedented impact of global sanctions, we continue to make every attempt to engage in good faith discussions with the Russian government and all Sakhalin-1 partners to effect a smooth exit to the benefit of all parties. Our priority all along has been to protect employees, the environment and the integrity of operations at the facility.  While the recent decrees violate our rights in Russia established by our production sharing agreement and interrupted the exit process we were working, it did not prevent us from safely winding down our operations. We're proud of our employees and the many significant achievements they led since 1996, including the most recent challenge of the government takeover. We do not anticipate any new material costs associated with the exit.  This next slide illustrates the variability the industry is experiencing across the markets most relevant to our business. In the third quarter, crude prices moved back within the upper end of the 10-year range as higher supply slightly exceeded demand. Natural gas prices rose to record levels in the third quarter, reflecting concerns in Europe about the withdrawal of Russian supply as well as efforts to build inventory ahead of winter. While natural gas prices recently moderated, they remain well above the 10-year historical range.  In the U.S., prices increased by about 15%, driven by higher summer cooling demand and inventory concerns. Refining margins remained well above the 10-year range due to inflated diesel crack spreads, resulting from expensive natural gas and high demand for diesel. Higher refinery runs and flat demand for gasoline in the U.S. resulted in refining margins declining from the second quarter. In contrast, global chemical margins fell below the bottom of the 10-year range, reflecting weakening global demand. Margins in North America and Europe have softened, with regional pricing moving closer to global parity as demand and logistics constraints relaxed.  Asia Pacific remained in bottom-of-cycle conditions as COVID restrictions continue to suppress demand in China. Despite these challenges, our chemical products business delivered another solid quarter on improved product mix, strong reliability and good cost control.  Before leaving this chart, I want to make one other very important point, the value of a diversified portfolio. With just the 3 quarters shown, you can see how the value has shifted across our different businesses. Our diversified portfolio has served us well during the volatile swings in prices and margins across the various businesses. As the energy system evolves along an uncertain path, the investments in our broad portfolio of advantaged businesses, including our Low Carbon Solutions business will play an even more important role in capturing value in outperforming competition in the very near term, and across a much longer time horizon.  Before I turn it over to Jennifer, let me recap our key takeaways on the quarter. We continue to progress our advantaged investments, drove additional structural efficiencies and created sustainable solutions that deliver the energy and products everyone needs. This has resulted in strong earnings growth, bolstered by higher refining throughput and cost control which more than offset margin declines.  We've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from our high-return assets in Guyana and the Permian. In addition, earlier this month, our low carbon solutions business signed the largest-of-its-kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This is a strong indication of the growth opportunity we have in this new business.  We've also continued to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the Aera Upstream and Billings refinery divestments and closing the sales of our Romanian Upstream affiliate and XTO Energy Canada. Our diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses and robust balance sheet provide a strong foundation to invest in value-accretive projects and drive attractive shareholder returns through the cycle.  In aggregate, the work we are doing today is delivering critical products in a very short market. Longer term, we're delivering improvements that strengthen our structural advantages, meet society's growing needs for energy and modern products, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and double earnings and cash flow by 2027 versus 2019. In short, profitably leading our industry toward a net zero future. Thank you.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren. Before we start our Q&A session, I have two important announcements to share with you all. Please mark your calendar for our annual Corporate Plan Update scheduled for Thursday, December 8 at 8:30 a.m. Central Standard Time, where I'll be joined by Kathy Mikells to share the details of our corporate plan. Additionally, please keep an eye out for our 2022 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in mid-December.  Now with that, we'll begin our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to you, Katie.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: So they were very strong results this quarter in the Downstream business, and you called out throughput, volume and mix as some of the factors there. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about some of the drivers here.  And then just more broadly, there's a lot of moving pieces in the macro picture at the moment of demand, SPR drives, China reopening, the EU embargo on Russian crude, just to name a few. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your outlook for refining as we head into next year as well.\nKathryn Mikells: Sure. Why don't I take the first question and maybe give you the macro. So if you look overall at our energy products business, obviously, it was a really strong quarter. That was really, from our perspective, led by the volume increases we saw. So we had record North American throughput. We had across the globe, the best results on throughput that we had seen since in 2008. And so if you look at the earnings bridge in terms of what happened quarter-to-quarter, that was worth almost $1 billion kind of improvement as a big driver in the results for energy products.  If you then look at what's going on in margins, obviously, margins softened in the quarter. They still remain well above what the 10-year average would be. If we look at those softer margins, they were really driven by downward pressure in gasoline margins due to lower-than-usual summer demand, specifically in the U.S. Diesel demand is continuing to be strong.  We then had some offsets to that pressure that we saw on margin. And specifically, if you look at some of the positive offsets we saw, we saw some favorable timing-driven impacts. We try to separate this, so you can kind of see it, separate it. Part of that was just mark-to-market on our open derivative portfolio, that was worth about $250 million favorable impact in the quarter. Other price timing impacts were worth about $600 million favorable impact in the quarter. That was really driven by derivatives that we use to ensure ratable pricing of refinery crude runs.  So if you put that to the side, we delivered about $5 billion in earnings outside of those price timing benefits in the quarter. And in addition to the other offsets for softening refining margins, we saw very strong aromatics margins. We did a good job on revenue management, so we saw positive benefits there.  And then overall, I would say, end-to-end, supply chain optimization, right, both through procurement and logistics and trading benefits on top of that. That's really embedded in the base business. And so we expect to see benefits out of those areas. They're not always ratable every quarter. But if you look over time, those benefits clearly accrue to the business.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And I'd just add, Devin, maybe a couple of points on top of what Kathy just explained. If you step back, you'll recall that we, in 2018, came up with a value chain concept that we're using in the Downstream and really looking to optimize from crude coming in the gate all the way to products being delivered at our customers' doorstep. And the work the organization has been doing to optimize that value chain has resulted in additional value, and I think continues to make that business much more robust than what I would say the industry average is. Kathy mentioned the trading, which has become an integral part of that value chain optimization step.  And then I would add finally that a lot of work has been going into making sure that we are positioning those facilities and our Downstream in our refineries to be robust to an evolving demand landscape. And so if you look at where we are investing in refining, it's for sites that have integrated chemicals, lubricants and fast-growing clean fuels business. And we think that gives us a structural advantage versus broader industry.  This has been and always has been a thin margin business. And so you typically scratch through the thin low periods, which lasts for a very long time and then take advantage of some of the highs. And as a result of that thin margin business, if you look over time, certainly in the West, refining capacity has been on the decline. We actually showed a chart last quarter and again this quarter that shows that drop in refining capacity.  If you look at some of the windfall taxes that are being talked about within Europe, that's going to put additional pressure on refining margins. So there is certainly a scenario out there that says we continue to see under-investment refining, we continue to see that capacity coming out of the market. And then depending on the build side of the equation and how much capacity gets built out in the Middle East, we could see tight markets for some time to come. Of course, we don't plan for that. We plan for thin margins and very tough conditions and then hope for the best.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Good morning and thanks for taking our questions. For our question and only question, bad habit here, it's on the balance sheet and cash returns. So I guess gross debt to cap now is just below the target range. Cash is now at $30 billion, which is at the top end of, I believe, the $20 billion to $30 billion level that you cited before that you want to maintain over time. So I guess what are the implications on the trajectory of the buyback?  And how are you really viewing the trade-off between potentially accelerating buyback sooner rather than later, given just the mechanical synergies of the dividend and then just being more aggressive on dividend increases, and there was a nice bump announced this morning to the dividend.\nKathryn Mikells: Sure. So first of all, I'd say our capital allocation priorities continue to be consistent and we're executing well against that. We've got to continue to make sure we're investing in the business. It's a long-cycle business and that consistency is really critical. We look for accretive acquisition opportunities. We're pretty disciplined in that area. And you've obviously seen us more recently looking to execute a number of divestitures in what's been a pretty good market for that activity.  We are really focused on ensuring that we've got a fortress balance sheet that gives us all the firepower and flexibility that we need to operate through the cycles and be really prepared for the next downturn. And then we're also really focused on ensuring that we're sharing our success with shareholders. We're trying to get that balance right. You obviously referenced the fact that we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03, so that will be reflected in the fourth quarter dividend coming up here shortly. We're in the process of executing a $30 billion -- up to $30 billion share repurchase program through 2023. We are on track to get $15 billion of that program done by the end of the year. We did about $10.5 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter. And if you look across the year, that would put us at $15 billion in dividends and about $15 billion in share repurchases. So I'd say both a pretty balanced return to our shareholders. And I think that puts us pretty well ahead of peers in terms of returning excess cash to shareholders.  So we are mindful of our cash balance. We ended the quarter at about $30 billion. It is possible that our cash balance is going to float up a little bit from there depending on what the market environment continues to look like. And we will continue conversations with our Board about the share repurchase program. But right now, we're just continuing to execute our plan.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Darren, I wonder if I could just ask you to opine on a kind of big picture issue. You, I think, and a number of your peers met recently with the administration relating to a number of things. I mean I think the only folks are probably not happy with your results this morning might be -- well be the administration. Can you share any thoughts you had about some of the risks presented by legislators around things like export bans on products, things of that nature, not least given how strong your Downstream profitability was this morning?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Doug, I'm going to probably pass on trying to predict where different governments or administrations here in the U.S. are going to go with respect to policy. We've been very explicit, I think, me, along with many of the peers in the industry around what I would say are the mechanics and the fundamentals of our industry and how it works and the implications for some of the policies being considered.  And I would say that in the short term, it may solve a political problem, but it will carry all the policies that I've heard people talking about, the export bans in particular, windfall profit tax. Those will carry significant long-term negative consequences. And it's just a question of, I think, how they balance out the political equation versus what I would say are some of those fundamentals.  For me, personally, for the company, what I would say is I feel like we're well positioned. Obviously, it would be a disadvantage to the industry. But I think within that disadvantage, we would find, because of our footprint, because of our diversification, an ability to position ourselves competitively with whatever policy comes down the road. And so our focus is really making sure people understand what the potential consequences of some of these policies are being considered.  And then in parallel with that, obviously, staying very focused on where I think the root cause or the root issue here is making sure that people all around the world and here in the U.S. get affordable and reliable energy. We recognize the pain that high prices cause. Unfortunately, the market that we're in today is a function of many of the policies and some of the narrative that's floated around in the past. And we basically have been working to make sure that when needed, when the products were required, which we anticipated, you'll recall back in 2020, we made the point that the industry is under-investing. We continue to lean in into the investments to spend at a rate higher than the rest of industry, so that when the call came, we would be there to answer.  And I think the results you've seen here in the third quarter is exactly that. Those investments are paying off. We've grown our production, both in the Upstream and are growing our production in Downstream and refining business with the expansion in Beaumont and then a real focus on reliability and high throughput. And so we keep trying to reiterate that, that we're doing what we can within the boundaries of what's available to us today. And then longer term, we are making the investments that's good for the administration's constituents and good for our business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Darren, I would love your perspective on M&A and just how you see that fitting into the go-forward framework and specifically, around upstream consolidation but also low carbon consolidation as you've said that you want to grow that business over time to be the size of the refining and chemicals business.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Neil, as you know, we've talked about this over the years quite a bit. And I would tell you that the whole M&A space and divestment space is something that we are constantly working. Obviously, our strategy, which you've seen us execute over the last several years is buy low, sell high. That's kind of what we're doing. We laid out a divestment program, but we took our time and were patient, waiting for market conditions to develop that would favor us as sellers. And that's what you've seen transacting here, likewise, as we look at acquisitions and opportunities constantly in the market, thinking about that and looking for it.  But we've got to find opportunities where we can see a clear synergy and develop a clear competitive advantage so that we bring some unique value to the transaction. And we're evaluating and looking at that in our traditional business so I think with time, those will show up, but we'll be very selective and strategic around that. And I would say, we'll do it when the market conditions are favorable for doing that.  On the Low Carbon Solutions, I think longer term, the concept sounds good in terms of M&A. But I would just put that in the context of this is a very immature market. And so there aren't a lot of established businesses out there today that are -- have what it takes to be successful in this space. If you think about starting an industry from scratch and what's required in terms of policy regulation, investment, connecting all the different pieces of a brand-new value chain, that's a complicated equation and fortunately, one that we think plays to our strengths.  And the recent deal that we announced with CF Industries, for us really demonstrated that in terms of the complexity of putting together each element of that value chain to successfully come up with a deal that's value accretive and it generates profits. And it's good for the planet, it's good for our shareholders.  And so I don't know how much we'll see how that develops. I would think in the M&A space, we may, over time, see opportunities that we can uniquely leverage and then we'll bring those into the portfolio when they make sense to do that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Richardson: Darren, I appreciate all the disclosure around the CF Industries project. I was wondering if you could talk about -- it probably comes as no surprise to anybody that you announced this shortly after the IRA was passed. But also, could you talk about what needs to happen on the policy side to kind of improve that abatement curve and kind of move more projects along?  And then also I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there's still some hurdles with permitting and -- do you see that at the local level, state level and where those might be? And then finally, if you could just address returns. How should investors think about the returns available on these projects, considering kind of policy and some of the risks around that versus some of the more conventional Upstream or Downstream projects?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes, maybe to start with the first point you made around the timing of that. While certainly, the IRA contributed to the value proposition there, I would say that, that project and that deal was being worked well before that and would work with the existing policy. It's been enhanced with the new policy, obviously.  And what I would just say with respect to what that IRA does, it essentially opens the aperture in terms of the CO2 that can be cost effectively captured or avoided. And if you think about the challenges associated with economic projects to capture and sequester CO2, really important variables in that would be the concentration of the CO2. The more dilute the CO2 stream, the more expensive the capturing step. And so you need greater incentives to catch more -- to capture more diluted streams, and so the IRA allows you more to economically pursue more diluted stream, so that opens up the opportunity space there.  Another really important variable is the distance to sequestration. And the transportation cost of moving CO2 to that. And so the further away you are from those, the sources are from the storage sites, the higher the cost. And again, the IRA helps with that space. And then obviously, there's some incentives for hydrogen and additional incentives for direct air capture. So I think directionally, those things are going to help. But I would also say that to achieve the ultimate objective in driving emissions down to net zero, you're going to need to capture a lot of diluted streams and the cost will be a lot higher. And so we're going to have to find additional incentives for that, whether it be through market forces and markets developing for CO2 or additional policy. With respect to what else has to happen, obviously, we're at the very early stages of this project where we've got the economic incentives laid out. We have a path forward but there's a lot to be done. We've got to get permits for storing the CO2. We've got some extensions to put on the pipeline. So there's other regulatory permitting steps that we have to take and the government -- we're working with the government to make sure that we can do that effectively so that we can expedite the project to get it online and start reducing those emissions. It's the equivalent of taking 700,000 cars off the road. So it's a fairly significant project in and of itself.  From a return standpoint, what I would say is, and we've talked about this before, we're insisting that the work we do here that we had positioned ourselves competitively versus the rest of industry and the thinking being that whatever incentives required for the marginal player out there to capture and store CO2 or develop biofuels or hydrogen, that we will leverage our advantages to drive a higher return. And to make sure that the projects that we bring into the portfolio are competitive in our portfolio.  And that's exactly what we're doing and CF Industries is an example of that, an accretive project that's competitive in our portfolio, that makes us money while reducing CO2. And I would say there are more opportunities like that out there. And the thing that Dan is doing in his Low Carbon Solutions business is looking for the opportunities where we can bring something unique to bear and therefore, drive above-industry average returns. And we feel pretty good about the size of that opportunity set.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: My question is about your gas realizations, which are a huge driver on the quarter. Would you characterize those as contractual or more optimization-driven? And then this is an addendum, but I think the seasonality of the gas market has changed a little bit because Europe has very high demand in the summer now because of a storage imperative. And so I wonder if you see that as a structural change to the global gas market and if it means anything for your investment prerogatives on the LNG chain or even in the U.S. within gas because we're going to be exporting a lot. So that's the question.\nKathryn Mikells: Yes, that's fine. I'll jump in, and Darren can add if he has anything. Overall, if you look at our results, we saw strong gas realizations, but we have an overall portfolio that's 60% gas, 40% LNG. The LNG tends to be tied to crude-related prices with a 3- to 6-month lag. So we're seeing the benefit of that lag now kind of coming through our results, and that really came through in the quarter.  Overall, from a demand perspective, you're obviously seeing a really tight market. We saw in Europe, the building of inventory and how that has driven prices in Europe, building of inventory ahead of the winter. And so structurally, we would say there's going to continue to be a tight market until supply and demand comes into equilibrium, right, in that there's only 2 ways that happen, either more supply or reduced demand and supply, especially supply of LNG does take time to bring online. It isn't something that is just a spigot that can be turned on overnight.  The market is obviously responding to that. We obviously have projects that are bringing more LNG online. Darren mentioned Mozambique, the Coral project reaching first gas production. Recently, we've got Golden Pass, which is going to be coming online in 2024. So we have investments that will bring more capacity online, and the industry, obviously, is responding to this, but it is going to take some time. So I'd say as we look at that seasonality, we're always mindful of what's happening in terms of inventories and when inventories are being built or being drawn and what that means in terms of near-term market conditions. And so it's something we always keep an eye on.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would just add, Sam. So once we get through this period where we're building inventories, we're short in supply and therefore, you've kind of lost some of that seasonality, that once we get to more of a balanced position, which I think is a couple of -- 3 years out, frankly, we'll start to see that seasonality show back up again when we're back in more stable markets.  Longer term, our view on gas has always been that's going to play a critical role and world economies for quite some time. And initially, it will go into power generation and back out coal. That's one of the big benefits of gas today. But longer term, as we continue to address emissions and the energy system transitions, gas can be used for ammonia and hydrogen along with carbon capture. And so you can find -- you can move into what I would say, a low emissions -- even lower emissions fuels and address the CO2. And I think gas is going to play an important role in that.  So I think our view hasn't really changed that there's going to be a fundamental need for gas for quite some time. And we're positioning ourselves to make sure that the portfolio of projects that we developed bring on natural gas on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. We're going to continue to be focused on making sure that we're competitive under any scenario, price scenario that we can envision out there. So that's how we're thinking about. That hasn't really changed, frankly.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Maybe just one quick clarification before I ask my question, which is the dividend raise you used to do, I think, with 1Q earnings the past couple of years, you've done with 3Q earnings. So is that a shift of timing or just any comments on that?  And then my question is just on the Chemicals outlook. As you mentioned, there has been some weakening in the market. Just wondering broadly how you see that market evolving in the next 6 to 12 months, supply -- additional supply coming online, additional demand weakness or will things get tighter?\nKathryn Mikells: Yes, I'll take the quick question on the dividend. We would have raised the dividend at the same time last year. One of the things I would mention is this is the 40th consecutive year where we've had an annual dividend increase. But we don't have a specific timing determined in any given point of the year in terms of when we make this decision. We look at it over time. We're obviously focused on having a competitive, sustainable, growing dividend over time. We know how important it is to shareholders and roughly 40% of our shareholders are consumers, and we know those people are very much focused on the dividend.\nDarren Woods: Yes. On Chemicals, just as you mentioned, third quarter, we talked about softer demand, really saw that as a consequence of the COVID lockdowns in China. We're very aware of some of the impacts that COVID is continuing to have in China. Now that's going to be a big determinant of what we see happening in margins and kind of supply-demand balance going out in time. It's just how well China recovers from that and how quickly they can move out of these periods of lockdown and get their current economic activity moving back again.  I think as you move outside of China, which is -- obviously, dominates demand out in Asia and move more west into the U.S. and Europe, I think Europe, obviously, with some of the energy challenges that they're facing, are going to have much slower economic activity than would be historical. So I expect to see some demand impacts coming from there.  And then in the U.S., I would just say it's kind of -- I would just characterize it more as uncertainty. I think some of the softness that we saw in the third quarter was driven by inventory draw for so many of our customers. And we typically see that when there's uncertainty about where future is going, positioning themselves for eventualities and making sure that they are covering themselves for potential downside.  So I think it's tough to tell. We'll have to see how the fourth quarter plays out. But in the short term, certainly, we see inventories coming down quite a bit. And then longer term, it will be a function of economic activity, obviously.\nKathryn Mikells: And then just one other thing I'd mention, we certainly see some industry supply that's coming on in the fourth quarter, and we commented on that just in terms of our look-forward expectations.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC Capital Markets.\nBiraj Borkhataria: I just wanted to ask about the LNG portfolio again. Could you clarify what proportion of your LNG sales are under long-term contracts and what proportion are sold on a spot basis? The reason I asked is because your assets are performing extremely well in Qatar, Papua New Guinea and Gorgon also. So I just wondered if that has allowed you to sell some incremental spot cargo. So what proportion is under long-term contract?  And if I could sneak a second one in, has there been a change to the 2022 Permian production kind of guidance in terms of growth? It looks slightly light relative to at least what I had in. So I was wondering if anything has changed there.\nKathryn Mikells: So the commentary I had made is in our LNG portfolio, about 80% of our volumes would be under long-term contract and we're seeing the benefit of the timing lag because those contracts are typically -- the pricing is tied to crude, but it's lagged kind of 3 to 6 months. So we're seeing that benefit now coming through our realizations.\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would say on the Permian, one of the challenges there is over the years, what we've been doing is working really hard to make sure we're maximizing the recovery of that resource. And I think we've talked before about some of the technology that we're bringing to bear to make sure that we are doing that in the most cost-advantaged way. Obviously, as we go through that, we're optimizing and adjusting our development plans. That continues to be the case. So I expect this year, we'll probably come in at about 20% up on last year's growth, which was up 25% from the year before. So still very solid growth in the Permian.  And if you look more broadly, we expect basically to meet the objectives that we talked about at the beginning of the year on overall production. If you look at what we had talked about at the beginning of the year for total production this year and where we'll end up, the delta there of about 100,000 barrels a day is really all driven by price entitlements and the fact that we're in much higher price environment.  So we feel pretty good about the production growth that we're seeing across the portfolio. We've talked about the record production in the Permian and Guyana is obviously performing very, very well with both of those boats running at above capacity.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: Kathy, can I come back to the -- I think, the very first question on energy products. And if we go back to the 8-K at the close of the quarter, you sort of suggested that industry margins would be a headwind of almost $3 billion. And today, your waterfall suggests that you've only really seen half of that. So I just want to understand, I mean, I don't recall there being ever as big a difference between new industry margins and the indicator margins and your realized margins. So what does it do you think about the portfolio that's allowing you to exceed that at such a degree?\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. And our impact from, I'd say, straight up refining margins came in kind of right in the middle of the range that we provided for the 8-K. And so beyond that, I mentioned we're seeing a positive beyond refining margins and aromatics margins, overall revenue management. And then end-to-end supply chain optimization and efficiency, which would include trading profit benefits.  And so I'd say, if you look at quarter-to-quarter, what we've seen in energy products, during the year, there's been a lot of volatility that's been basically tagged to the moving price environment. If you look at that over a longer period of time, say, year-to-date, it looks, I would say, pretty normalized. And then we try to give you information on things that were price timing stuff that occurred in the quarter, but over time, we would expect to be pretty neutral.  And so I mentioned specifically the program that we have, that we use derivatives to basically ensure ratable pricing of refinery crude run. Over time, we'd expect that to be neutral. You would have seen in the price timing impacts that, that was about a $600 million favorable impact for the quarter.  So I would say what goes on in terms of overall supply chain optimization and how we're trading around our physical footprint, doesn't come through our results ratably every quarter. This quarter, it was obviously a lot stronger. But if you look at it over a long period of time, that benefit that's embedded in the business clearly shows through.\nAlastair Syme: Do you think going forward in the 8-K, you would expect to be closer to that industry margin?\nKathryn Mikells: It's really going to depend what the price environment is, what comes out of our trading portfolio in the fourth quarter. Obviously, I'd say, as you also looked at the overall benefits from the business, I'd say the big positive volume factor that we had was something that wouldn't get reflected in our 8-K because we had incredibly high throughput and utilization. So what I try to tell you is if you put the price timing impacts to the side, we would start at about $5 billion in profit in energy products, and then it's going to be about what the -- how the market unfolds in the fourth quarter.\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would just add to that the 8-K was really looking at what the market factors are. And then to the extent within the business, we're working hard to improve upon that through the optimization that Kathy mentioned through revenue management across that entire value chain and then trading. And as trading moves and with the accounting rules as that booking happens with time, that comes in less than ratable. We saw that in this margin bucket this quarter. And that will move around as we move forward depending on the price environment that we're in.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Most of mine were asked, but if you could just maybe talk about the status of the refinery strikes in France. I know you had a couple of facilities that were impacted there that I believe are ramping back up. Where are we now with those facilities? And when do you expect them back in full? And do you think it actually has a meaningful impact on your 4Q results for Downstream?\nDarren Woods: Yes. The -- so we reached an agreement with the workers some time ago and those refineries are basically going back through the start-up process. When those refineries strike, we've got to bring those units down and free them of hydrocarbon. And so that's a fairly thorough process of cleaning out the hydrocarbon -- clearing the hydrocarbon.  So when we go to bring those back up, it's a fairly rigorous process of starting those back up to make sure we do that safely. So it takes some time to ramp things back up again. That's what the organization is working on. I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact. I mean, obviously, in a market that's short, any capacity that comes offline raises the overall prices within the industry. And so I think net-net, that will probably -- there's some mitigation there with respect to our other refineries that are up and running. So I don't think we'll see that in the results, frankly.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Maybe if I could follow up on the Permian and your activity levels there. The expectations for U.S. supply growth in 2023, I would say, have probably been falling a little bit across the board, at least partially because of constraints across service providers. As you look towards your 2023 program, how much do you anticipate stepping up activity levels in the Permian to achieve that program? And if the market supports it, is there appetite or interest or even ability on your part to accelerate further? So how much activity increase is based into the program? And how tight do you see the market there in terms of your ability to kind of move around that?\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. Well, I think the point you make are good ones. The market is tight. And I think generally, the industry -- there's not a lot of capacity as you look across the different steps required to bring on additional production. So I think that is tight. That will, obviously, with time loosen up a little bit. But I think, generally speaking, for the industry, it's constrained. Obviously, every company will have different degrees of freedom in that space. We have some degrees of freedom there, but I would just say we're staying very firmly grounded in our philosophy of making sure that the investments that we make generate high returns at low prices.  And so the capital discipline -- my definition of capital discipline is making sure that you spend money that's advantaged and has -- generates good returns even in the down cycle. We're going to stay grounded in that. And so anything that we do on the margin has to, first and foremost, meet that criteria, that it's robust to a wide range of price environments, and that we'd be happy irrespective of what prices we're seeing out the window.  We've got capacity to do that, frankly, and some space. So we will, on the margin, spend money to -- where we can see an opportunity to bring that on. But I wouldn't say -- if you look at kind of the range of CapEx that we've provided over the years, we gave ourselves that range, obviously, anticipated movement not only within the year, but across from 1 year to the next. And so we feel pretty good that -- in terms of the ranges that we've provided, our plans going forward are still very consistent with those ranges. And Kathy will spend more time talking about that in December when she takes you through the plan that we will get endorsed with the Board next month.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Just curious that I don't actually record in the product, Exxon talked about trading is a major contributor to the result. Historically, I think the U.S. companies, such as you and tends to take a more conservative approach and trading compared to your European customers. So just curious, are we seeing the company having a somewhat change in the trading strategy going forward? Or that this is just a unique circumstance and that when we're talking about trading, what kind of trading are we referring to that is making a big contribution this quarter?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Paul, I'll touch on that, and if Kathy's got anything to add, I'll let her jump in on the back. But what I would say is, and I think we talked about this some years ago that we were -- when we moved to the value chain constructs, when we combined our fuels marketing organization with our refining organization and start looking at optimizing value all along the value chain, the trading organization became a much more relevant channel with respect to optimization.  And so at that time, so back in 2018, we made the decision to invest more in trading and to change the approach there to optimize, to act as an optimization tool along all of our assets. And you may recall, we talked about asset-backed trading. And that continues to be an important part of the Product Solutions business, and more specifically, the Downstream element of the business as well as our Upstream crude. And so that organization has grown with time and continues to perform that optimization function.  I think what you're seeing this quarter, in particular, is the point that Kathy made, which is with the way you account for trading, that can be kind of noisy quarter-on-quarter. And that if you look longer term, you can see the value kind of embedded within the businesses. And it is, I would say, very embedded within those businesses. So we don't break it out just because it is an asset-backed trading strategy. And therefore, the value derived through that, obviously, is through trading, but obviously, also through running all our refineries reliably, having the product and having the assets to support the arbitrages and the trade activities that under -- that create that value.  This quarter we saw with the way that the prices moved, a bigger chunk of it booked in the quarter. But I would just say, as you look at that over time, it is a meaningful contributor to the value equation in our Downstream value chain.\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. And then the only thing I would add to that is we are trying to also tell you that there's some impacts that over time, we expect to be neutral. So the fact that we use derivatives to ensure ratable pricing of our refinery crude runs sometimes that's going to give us a positive in a quarter. Sometimes that's going to give us a negative in the quarter. Over time, it should be neutral.\nDarren Woods: That's why we've tried to break that out with the price timing.\nPaul Cheng: That's great. And Kathy, just curious that the trading also contributed to the strong natural gas price utilization that you record? Or that had nothing to do with that?\nKathryn Mikells: We also have trading that we would be doing within our Upstream business. And so you can see that, some of those impacts reported in our results, but that, we have spot, I would say, exposure, and we do trade around that as well, very embedded in the business. It's not really as big a factor as what we would have seen, obviously, in energy products.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: My quick question is just on costs. Specifically, could you all speak to your thoughts for 2023 on OFS inflation and other rising costs particularly in your 2 highest return areas, the Permian and Guyana?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I'll touch on that, Neal. I mean, obviously, we're subject to the same broad market forces that everyone is seeing out there and so inflationary pressures across a number of our sectors and activities. I think a couple of things. One is, as you will recall, as we went through the pandemic in the downturn, we were very -- took a very concerted effort to work with our contracting partners and the recognition that we would be back, that we would longer term, be running rigs and putting pipe in the ground. And so tried to enter into contracts that reflected that longer term objective, and that has helped manage some of the inflationary impacts and that we kind of set some contracts back in the downturn with a commitment to continue to spend money going forward.  And so that's been an offset. And then, of course, the organization, with all the changes that we've been making. Remember, we took our Upstream organization from 7 plus businesses down to 1 and organized very, very differently. We've centralized a lot of the functions, really trying to harness our scale and leverage the purchasing power that we have and then cut our costs out. So all those efforts to become more efficient and more effective in the marketplace and reduce costs are having a significant impact.  We mentioned in the earnings release that to date, we have $6.4 billion of structural savings versus 2019 and we're well on our way to meeting the objective we set by end 2023 of $9 billion in structural savings. So that's helping to offset some of those inflationary pressures. And then on top of that, with the centralized organizations and more effectively leveraging the scale, we're getting what I would call -- what we term as kind of short-term efficiencies, purchasing power, however you want to think about that, that we don't put in the structural bucket, but actually helps us to offset costs.  And so we've challenged ourselves to deliver on our expense budget for the year and to offset inflation. The organization is doing a pretty good job at that. I think we'll be within rounding with respect to that. And then next year, the organization is very focused on using the opportunities that have been created through the restructuring of our business to offset those inflationary pressures. And we're going to stretch ourselves to see how much of that we can do.\nJennifer Driscoll: Katie, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. Maybe just to follow up on the capacity question that was asked earlier, but rather than just focus on services capacity in a particular region or something like that, Darren, I was curious, if you look at tightness, be it LNG, refining, et cetera, what do you think it takes? Or do you believe that the capacity exists for the world to move forward and do what it needs to do over the next, say, 2 to 3 years to add capacity? Or do you see it as a situation where there probably is a no other option but to curtail demand for some period of time? It's kind of a macro question, but you brought it up in the intro, and it's kind of picking at me here as to what's the way out of this maze.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Thanks, Roger. I think the industry has been historically pretty good at flexing on capacity to meet the demand. And so I'm optimistic that with time, the market -- and we've proven this, I think, over the years, that the markets will come back into balance, but it is a function of time.  I think in the short term, everyone will squeeze what they can. Certainly, you've seen us pushing as hard as we can to make sure that we're running reliably, and we're getting product to the marketplace to meet that need in the market. I know everyone else is trying to do the same. So I think that piece of it is sweating all the existing assets as hard as you can. It's going to help in the short term, but longer -- but more structurally, it's just a function of getting these projects developed and on track.  I mean fortunately for us, we've had a very healthy pipeline of projects that have been in work. And so it's not -- we're not out trying to find something to work on. We're basically focused on delivering the pipeline that we've got. And we're bringing on -- as we talked about, we brought in Coral floating LNG out of Mozambique this quarter. That's additional capacity. We're progressing investments in Papua New Guinea. We've got Golden Pass here in the U.S., that's progressing very large LNG export terminal that should come online in 2024. That's going to probably increase the exports out of the Gulf Coast by 20%. So I think the capacity is there. It's just a function of the time it takes to build these very significant projects.  And I would also tell you that if you look at on the crude side of the equation, we're making very good progress with the next poke into Guyana. We continue to believe we're going to bring that in a little bit early and we're progressing the ones after that. So I think the capacity is there. It's -- the challenge is executing efficiently so that you're getting -- you're spending your capital efficiently and then doing it in a way that brings it on an expedited fashion, which is what we're focused on doing.\nKathryn Mikells: And then just the one thing I'd add is on the demand side, I think all companies that can are looking to conserve, especially LNG, so that it can be there for other use. So across our footprint in Europe, we've already kind of switched over 65% of our use of LNG to other fuel sources so that it can be there for other use. And I expect that other industry players are doing the same.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thanks, Roger. Thanks, everybody, for your questions today. We will post the transcript of the Q&A session on our investor website early next week. Have a nice weekend, everyone, and let me turn it back to Katie to conclude our call. Katie?\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathryn Mikells",
            "content": "Sure. Why don't I take the first question and maybe give you the macro. So if you look overall at our energy products business, obviously, it was a really strong quarter. That was really, from our perspective, led by the volume increases we saw. So we had record North American throughput. We had across the globe, the best results on throughput that we had seen since in 2008. And so if you look at the earnings bridge in terms of what happened quarter-to-quarter, that was worth almost $1 billion kind of improvement as a big driver in the results for energy products.  If you then look at what's going on in margins, obviously, margins softened in the quarter. They still remain well above what the 10-year average would be. If we look at those softer margins, they were really driven by downward pressure in gasoline margins due to lower-than-usual summer demand, specifically in the U.S. Diesel demand is continuing to be strong.  We then had some offsets to that pressure that we saw on margin. And specifically, if you look at some of the positive offsets we saw, we saw some favorable timing-driven impacts. We try to separate this, so you can kind of see it, separate it. Part of that was just mark-to-market on our open derivative portfolio, that was worth about $250 million favorable impact in the quarter. Other price timing impacts were worth about $600 million favorable impact in the quarter. That was really driven by derivatives that we use to ensure ratable pricing of refinery crude runs.  So if you put that to the side, we delivered about $5 billion in earnings outside of those price timing benefits in the quarter. And in addition to the other offsets for softening refining margins, we saw very strong aromatics margins. We did a good job on revenue management, so we saw positive benefits there.  And then overall, I would say, end-to-end, supply chain optimization, right, both through procurement and logistics and trading benefits on top of that. That's really embedded in the base business. And so we expect to see benefits out of those areas. They're not always ratable every quarter. But if you look over time, those benefits clearly accrue to the business. Sure. So first of all, I'd say our capital allocation priorities continue to be consistent and we're executing well against that. We've got to continue to make sure we're investing in the business. It's a long-cycle business and that consistency is really critical. We look for accretive acquisition opportunities. We're pretty disciplined in that area. And you've obviously seen us more recently looking to execute a number of divestitures in what's been a pretty good market for that activity.  We are really focused on ensuring that we've got a fortress balance sheet that gives us all the firepower and flexibility that we need to operate through the cycles and be really prepared for the next downturn. And then we're also really focused on ensuring that we're sharing our success with shareholders. We're trying to get that balance right. You obviously referenced the fact that we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03, so that will be reflected in the fourth quarter dividend coming up here shortly. We're in the process of executing a $30 billion -- up to $30 billion share repurchase program through 2023. We are on track to get $15 billion of that program done by the end of the year. We did about $10.5 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter. And if you look across the year, that would put us at $15 billion in dividends and about $15 billion in share repurchases. So I'd say both a pretty balanced return to our shareholders. And I think that puts us pretty well ahead of peers in terms of returning excess cash to shareholders.  So we are mindful of our cash balance. We ended the quarter at about $30 billion. It is possible that our cash balance is going to float up a little bit from there depending on what the market environment continues to look like. And we will continue conversations with our Board about the share repurchase program. But right now, we're just continuing to execute our plan. Yes, that's fine. I'll jump in, and Darren can add if he has anything. Overall, if you look at our results, we saw strong gas realizations, but we have an overall portfolio that's 60% gas, 40% LNG. The LNG tends to be tied to crude-related prices with a 3- to 6-month lag. So we're seeing the benefit of that lag now kind of coming through our results, and that really came through in the quarter.  Overall, from a demand perspective, you're obviously seeing a really tight market. We saw in Europe, the building of inventory and how that has driven prices in Europe, building of inventory ahead of the winter. And so structurally, we would say there's going to continue to be a tight market until supply and demand comes into equilibrium, right, in that there's only 2 ways that happen, either more supply or reduced demand and supply, especially supply of LNG does take time to bring online. It isn't something that is just a spigot that can be turned on overnight.  The market is obviously responding to that. We obviously have projects that are bringing more LNG online. Darren mentioned Mozambique, the Coral project reaching first gas production. Recently, we've got Golden Pass, which is going to be coming online in 2024. So we have investments that will bring more capacity online, and the industry, obviously, is responding to this, but it is going to take some time. So I'd say as we look at that seasonality, we're always mindful of what's happening in terms of inventories and when inventories are being built or being drawn and what that means in terms of near-term market conditions. And so it's something we always keep an eye on. Yes, I'll take the quick question on the dividend. We would have raised the dividend at the same time last year. One of the things I would mention is this is the 40th consecutive year where we've had an annual dividend increase. But we don't have a specific timing determined in any given point of the year in terms of when we make this decision. We look at it over time. We're obviously focused on having a competitive, sustainable, growing dividend over time. We know how important it is to shareholders and roughly 40% of our shareholders are consumers, and we know those people are very much focused on the dividend. And then just one other thing I'd mention, we certainly see some industry supply that's coming on in the fourth quarter, and we commented on that just in terms of our look-forward expectations. So the commentary I had made is in our LNG portfolio, about 80% of our volumes would be under long-term contract and we're seeing the benefit of the timing lag because those contracts are typically -- the pricing is tied to crude, but it's lagged kind of 3 to 6 months. So we're seeing that benefit now coming through our realizations. Yes. And our impact from, I'd say, straight up refining margins came in kind of right in the middle of the range that we provided for the 8-K. And so beyond that, I mentioned we're seeing a positive beyond refining margins and aromatics margins, overall revenue management. And then end-to-end supply chain optimization and efficiency, which would include trading profit benefits.  And so I'd say, if you look at quarter-to-quarter, what we've seen in energy products, during the year, there's been a lot of volatility that's been basically tagged to the moving price environment. If you look at that over a longer period of time, say, year-to-date, it looks, I would say, pretty normalized. And then we try to give you information on things that were price timing stuff that occurred in the quarter, but over time, we would expect to be pretty neutral.  And so I mentioned specifically the program that we have, that we use derivatives to basically ensure ratable pricing of refinery crude run. Over time, we'd expect that to be neutral. You would have seen in the price timing impacts that, that was about a $600 million favorable impact for the quarter.  So I would say what goes on in terms of overall supply chain optimization and how we're trading around our physical footprint, doesn't come through our results ratably every quarter. This quarter, it was obviously a lot stronger. But if you look at it over a long period of time, that benefit that's embedded in the business clearly shows through. It's really going to depend what the price environment is, what comes out of our trading portfolio in the fourth quarter. Obviously, I'd say, as you also looked at the overall benefits from the business, I'd say the big positive volume factor that we had was something that wouldn't get reflected in our 8-K because we had incredibly high throughput and utilization. So what I try to tell you is if you put the price timing impacts to the side, we would start at about $5 billion in profit in energy products, and then it's going to be about what the -- how the market unfolds in the fourth quarter. Yes. And then the only thing I would add to that is we are trying to also tell you that there's some impacts that over time, we expect to be neutral. So the fact that we use derivatives to ensure ratable pricing of our refinery crude runs sometimes that's going to give us a positive in a quarter. Sometimes that's going to give us a negative in the quarter. Over time, it should be neutral. We also have trading that we would be doing within our Upstream business. And so you can see that, some of those impacts reported in our results, but that, we have spot, I would say, exposure, and we do trade around that as well, very embedded in the business. It's not really as big a factor as what we would have seen, obviously, in energy products.

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Before covering our earnings highlights, I want to begin by recognizing the men and women of ExxonMobil. While this quarter's results were clearly helped by a favorable market, fact is we're in this position because of the hard work and commitment of our people over the past few years. Where others pulled back in the face of uncertainty and a historic slowdown, retreating and retrenching, this company moved forward, continuing to invest and build to help meet the demands we see today and position the company for long-term success in each of our businesses.  We understand how important our role is in providing the energy and products the world needs. And while the market has clearly been a factor, results we report today reflect that deep commitment. I mentioned this because it is at the heart of our company and its culture. We know the role we play and are incredibly proud of it. We work together as a team, confident in our mission and determined to do our part in meeting the world's energy needs and leading the way in a thoughtful energy transition.  Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter operational and financial results. Higher natural gas realizations, strong refinery throughput, robust refining margins and rigorous cost control drove our earnings improvement. We continue to increase production to address the needs of consumers, which contributed to earnings and cash flow growth, a stronger balance sheet and significant value creation. Our results also reflected the outstanding work of our teams across the world who operate our facilities reliably at high utilization rates.  Let me highlight a few examples of our progress. First, Energy Products. We boosted overall refinery throughput to its highest quarterly level since 2008, responding to tight market conditions. And we continue to make progress on the Beaumont refinery expansion, which will increase capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023.  We also increased production from our high-return assets in the Permian and Guyana. Our production in the Permian Basin reached nearly 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, building on our strong growth from last year. We grew our production in Guyana to 360,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, with Liza Phase 1 and 2, both exceeding design capacity. We also had continued exploration success with 2 additional discoveries in the quarter. Earlier this month, first LNG production was achieved from Mozambique's Coral South floating LNG development, contributing new supply amid growing demand for LNG globally.  We continue to expect total upstream production of 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels per day for the year. Looking longer term, we remain on track to grow low-cost production and meet our 2027 plan, with more than 90% of our Upstream investments, generating over 10% returns at $35 per barrel.  Our ability to increase production while reducing cost, improves our competitive position, benefits consumers and generates capital to fund meaningful investments, demonstrated by one of our recent press releases, announcing that our low carbon solutions business signed its first and the largest of its kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2.  This marks an important milestone in developing our newest business. It's also a good example of how we're supporting other companies in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. We look forward to sharing more about our progress in developing attractive low-carbon solutions business in December as part of our corporate plan discussions.  We continue to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the sale of our interest in the Aera oil production operations in California and our refinery in Billings, Montana. Proceeds from divestments completed year-to-date totaled $4 billion as we captured incremental value for these noncore assets in today's higher price environment. These sales enable us to concentrate on our higher-value advantaged assets.  Finally, you may have heard earlier this month that with 2 decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated ExxonMobil's interest in Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project to a Russian operator. In March, we stated our intention to exit the Sakhalin-1 project and discontinue our role as operator and took an impairment of approximately $3.4 billion at the time.  While our affiliate was in force majeure due to the unprecedented impact of global sanctions, we continue to make every attempt to engage in good faith discussions with the Russian government and all Sakhalin-1 partners to effect a smooth exit to the benefit of all parties. Our priority all along has been to protect employees, the environment and the integrity of operations at the facility.  While the recent decrees violate our rights in Russia established by our production sharing agreement and interrupted the exit process we were working, it did not prevent us from safely winding down our operations. We're proud of our employees and the many significant achievements they led since 1996, including the most recent challenge of the government takeover. We do not anticipate any new material costs associated with the exit.  This next slide illustrates the variability the industry is experiencing across the markets most relevant to our business. In the third quarter, crude prices moved back within the upper end of the 10-year range as higher supply slightly exceeded demand. Natural gas prices rose to record levels in the third quarter, reflecting concerns in Europe about the withdrawal of Russian supply as well as efforts to build inventory ahead of winter. While natural gas prices recently moderated, they remain well above the 10-year historical range.  In the U.S., prices increased by about 15%, driven by higher summer cooling demand and inventory concerns. Refining margins remained well above the 10-year range due to inflated diesel crack spreads, resulting from expensive natural gas and high demand for diesel. Higher refinery runs and flat demand for gasoline in the U.S. resulted in refining margins declining from the second quarter. In contrast, global chemical margins fell below the bottom of the 10-year range, reflecting weakening global demand. Margins in North America and Europe have softened, with regional pricing moving closer to global parity as demand and logistics constraints relaxed.  Asia Pacific remained in bottom-of-cycle conditions as COVID restrictions continue to suppress demand in China. Despite these challenges, our chemical products business delivered another solid quarter on improved product mix, strong reliability and good cost control.  Before leaving this chart, I want to make one other very important point, the value of a diversified portfolio. With just the 3 quarters shown, you can see how the value has shifted across our different businesses. Our diversified portfolio has served us well during the volatile swings in prices and margins across the various businesses. As the energy system evolves along an uncertain path, the investments in our broad portfolio of advantaged businesses, including our Low Carbon Solutions business will play an even more important role in capturing value in outperforming competition in the very near term, and across a much longer time horizon.  Before I turn it over to Jennifer, let me recap our key takeaways on the quarter. We continue to progress our advantaged investments, drove additional structural efficiencies and created sustainable solutions that deliver the energy and products everyone needs. This has resulted in strong earnings growth, bolstered by higher refining throughput and cost control which more than offset margin declines.  We've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from our high-return assets in Guyana and the Permian. In addition, earlier this month, our low carbon solutions business signed the largest-of-its-kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This is a strong indication of the growth opportunity we have in this new business.  We've also continued to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the Aera Upstream and Billings refinery divestments and closing the sales of our Romanian Upstream affiliate and XTO Energy Canada. Our diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses and robust balance sheet provide a strong foundation to invest in value-accretive projects and drive attractive shareholder returns through the cycle.  In aggregate, the work we are doing today is delivering critical products in a very short market. Longer term, we're delivering improvements that strengthen our structural advantages, meet society's growing needs for energy and modern products, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and double earnings and cash flow by 2027 versus 2019. In short, profitably leading our industry toward a net zero future. Thank you. Yes. And I'd just add, Devin, maybe a couple of points on top of what Kathy just explained. If you step back, you'll recall that we, in 2018, came up with a value chain concept that we're using in the Downstream and really looking to optimize from crude coming in the gate all the way to products being delivered at our customers' doorstep. And the work the organization has been doing to optimize that value chain has resulted in additional value, and I think continues to make that business much more robust than what I would say the industry average is. Kathy mentioned the trading, which has become an integral part of that value chain optimization step.  And then I would add finally that a lot of work has been going into making sure that we are positioning those facilities and our Downstream in our refineries to be robust to an evolving demand landscape. And so if you look at where we are investing in refining, it's for sites that have integrated chemicals, lubricants and fast-growing clean fuels business. And we think that gives us a structural advantage versus broader industry.  This has been and always has been a thin margin business. And so you typically scratch through the thin low periods, which lasts for a very long time and then take advantage of some of the highs. And as a result of that thin margin business, if you look over time, certainly in the West, refining capacity has been on the decline. We actually showed a chart last quarter and again this quarter that shows that drop in refining capacity.  If you look at some of the windfall taxes that are being talked about within Europe, that's going to put additional pressure on refining margins. So there is certainly a scenario out there that says we continue to see under-investment refining, we continue to see that capacity coming out of the market. And then depending on the build side of the equation and how much capacity gets built out in the Middle East, we could see tight markets for some time to come. Of course, we don't plan for that. We plan for thin margins and very tough conditions and then hope for the best. Yes. Doug, I'm going to probably pass on trying to predict where different governments or administrations here in the U.S. are going to go with respect to policy. We've been very explicit, I think, me, along with many of the peers in the industry around what I would say are the mechanics and the fundamentals of our industry and how it works and the implications for some of the policies being considered.  And I would say that in the short term, it may solve a political problem, but it will carry all the policies that I've heard people talking about, the export bans in particular, windfall profit tax. Those will carry significant long-term negative consequences. And it's just a question of, I think, how they balance out the political equation versus what I would say are some of those fundamentals.  For me, personally, for the company, what I would say is I feel like we're well positioned. Obviously, it would be a disadvantage to the industry. But I think within that disadvantage, we would find, because of our footprint, because of our diversification, an ability to position ourselves competitively with whatever policy comes down the road. And so our focus is really making sure people understand what the potential consequences of some of these policies are being considered.  And then in parallel with that, obviously, staying very focused on where I think the root cause or the root issue here is making sure that people all around the world and here in the U.S. get affordable and reliable energy. We recognize the pain that high prices cause. Unfortunately, the market that we're in today is a function of many of the policies and some of the narrative that's floated around in the past. And we basically have been working to make sure that when needed, when the products were required, which we anticipated, you'll recall back in 2020, we made the point that the industry is under-investing. We continue to lean in into the investments to spend at a rate higher than the rest of industry, so that when the call came, we would be there to answer.  And I think the results you've seen here in the third quarter is exactly that. Those investments are paying off. We've grown our production, both in the Upstream and are growing our production in Downstream and refining business with the expansion in Beaumont and then a real focus on reliability and high throughput. And so we keep trying to reiterate that, that we're doing what we can within the boundaries of what's available to us today. And then longer term, we are making the investments that's good for the administration's constituents and good for our business. Sure. Neil, as you know, we've talked about this over the years quite a bit. And I would tell you that the whole M&A space and divestment space is something that we are constantly working. Obviously, our strategy, which you've seen us execute over the last several years is buy low, sell high. That's kind of what we're doing. We laid out a divestment program, but we took our time and were patient, waiting for market conditions to develop that would favor us as sellers. And that's what you've seen transacting here, likewise, as we look at acquisitions and opportunities constantly in the market, thinking about that and looking for it.  But we've got to find opportunities where we can see a clear synergy and develop a clear competitive advantage so that we bring some unique value to the transaction. And we're evaluating and looking at that in our traditional business so I think with time, those will show up, but we'll be very selective and strategic around that. And I would say, we'll do it when the market conditions are favorable for doing that.  On the Low Carbon Solutions, I think longer term, the concept sounds good in terms of M&A. But I would just put that in the context of this is a very immature market. And so there aren't a lot of established businesses out there today that are -- have what it takes to be successful in this space. If you think about starting an industry from scratch and what's required in terms of policy regulation, investment, connecting all the different pieces of a brand-new value chain, that's a complicated equation and fortunately, one that we think plays to our strengths.  And the recent deal that we announced with CF Industries, for us really demonstrated that in terms of the complexity of putting together each element of that value chain to successfully come up with a deal that's value accretive and it generates profits. And it's good for the planet, it's good for our shareholders.  And so I don't know how much we'll see how that develops. I would think in the M&A space, we may, over time, see opportunities that we can uniquely leverage and then we'll bring those into the portfolio when they make sense to do that. Sure. Yes, maybe to start with the first point you made around the timing of that. While certainly, the IRA contributed to the value proposition there, I would say that, that project and that deal was being worked well before that and would work with the existing policy. It's been enhanced with the new policy, obviously.  And what I would just say with respect to what that IRA does, it essentially opens the aperture in terms of the CO2 that can be cost effectively captured or avoided. And if you think about the challenges associated with economic projects to capture and sequester CO2, really important variables in that would be the concentration of the CO2. The more dilute the CO2 stream, the more expensive the capturing step. And so you need greater incentives to catch more -- to capture more diluted streams, and so the IRA allows you more to economically pursue more diluted stream, so that opens up the opportunity space there.  Another really important variable is the distance to sequestration. And the transportation cost of moving CO2 to that. And so the further away you are from those, the sources are from the storage sites, the higher the cost. And again, the IRA helps with that space. And then obviously, there's some incentives for hydrogen and additional incentives for direct air capture. So I think directionally, those things are going to help. But I would also say that to achieve the ultimate objective in driving emissions down to net zero, you're going to need to capture a lot of diluted streams and the cost will be a lot higher. And so we're going to have to find additional incentives for that, whether it be through market forces and markets developing for CO2 or additional policy. With respect to what else has to happen, obviously, we're at the very early stages of this project where we've got the economic incentives laid out. We have a path forward but there's a lot to be done. We've got to get permits for storing the CO2. We've got some extensions to put on the pipeline. So there's other regulatory permitting steps that we have to take and the government -- we're working with the government to make sure that we can do that effectively so that we can expedite the project to get it online and start reducing those emissions. It's the equivalent of taking 700,000 cars off the road. So it's a fairly significant project in and of itself.  From a return standpoint, what I would say is, and we've talked about this before, we're insisting that the work we do here that we had positioned ourselves competitively versus the rest of industry and the thinking being that whatever incentives required for the marginal player out there to capture and store CO2 or develop biofuels or hydrogen, that we will leverage our advantages to drive a higher return. And to make sure that the projects that we bring into the portfolio are competitive in our portfolio.  And that's exactly what we're doing and CF Industries is an example of that, an accretive project that's competitive in our portfolio, that makes us money while reducing CO2. And I would say there are more opportunities like that out there. And the thing that Dan is doing in his Low Carbon Solutions business is looking for the opportunities where we can bring something unique to bear and therefore, drive above-industry average returns. And we feel pretty good about the size of that opportunity set. Yes, I would just add, Sam. So once we get through this period where we're building inventories, we're short in supply and therefore, you've kind of lost some of that seasonality, that once we get to more of a balanced position, which I think is a couple of -- 3 years out, frankly, we'll start to see that seasonality show back up again when we're back in more stable markets.  Longer term, our view on gas has always been that's going to play a critical role and world economies for quite some time. And initially, it will go into power generation and back out coal. That's one of the big benefits of gas today. But longer term, as we continue to address emissions and the energy system transitions, gas can be used for ammonia and hydrogen along with carbon capture. And so you can find -- you can move into what I would say, a low emissions -- even lower emissions fuels and address the CO2. And I think gas is going to play an important role in that.  So I think our view hasn't really changed that there's going to be a fundamental need for gas for quite some time. And we're positioning ourselves to make sure that the portfolio of projects that we developed bring on natural gas on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. We're going to continue to be focused on making sure that we're competitive under any scenario, price scenario that we can envision out there. So that's how we're thinking about. That hasn't really changed, frankly. Yes. On Chemicals, just as you mentioned, third quarter, we talked about softer demand, really saw that as a consequence of the COVID lockdowns in China. We're very aware of some of the impacts that COVID is continuing to have in China. Now that's going to be a big determinant of what we see happening in margins and kind of supply-demand balance going out in time. It's just how well China recovers from that and how quickly they can move out of these periods of lockdown and get their current economic activity moving back again.  I think as you move outside of China, which is -- obviously, dominates demand out in Asia and move more west into the U.S. and Europe, I think Europe, obviously, with some of the energy challenges that they're facing, are going to have much slower economic activity than would be historical. So I expect to see some demand impacts coming from there.  And then in the U.S., I would just say it's kind of -- I would just characterize it more as uncertainty. I think some of the softness that we saw in the third quarter was driven by inventory draw for so many of our customers. And we typically see that when there's uncertainty about where future is going, positioning themselves for eventualities and making sure that they are covering themselves for potential downside.  So I think it's tough to tell. We'll have to see how the fourth quarter plays out. But in the short term, certainly, we see inventories coming down quite a bit. And then longer term, it will be a function of economic activity, obviously. Yes. I would say on the Permian, one of the challenges there is over the years, what we've been doing is working really hard to make sure we're maximizing the recovery of that resource. And I think we've talked before about some of the technology that we're bringing to bear to make sure that we are doing that in the most cost-advantaged way. Obviously, as we go through that, we're optimizing and adjusting our development plans. That continues to be the case. So I expect this year, we'll probably come in at about 20% up on last year's growth, which was up 25% from the year before. So still very solid growth in the Permian.  And if you look more broadly, we expect basically to meet the objectives that we talked about at the beginning of the year on overall production. If you look at what we had talked about at the beginning of the year for total production this year and where we'll end up, the delta there of about 100,000 barrels a day is really all driven by price entitlements and the fact that we're in much higher price environment.  So we feel pretty good about the production growth that we're seeing across the portfolio. We've talked about the record production in the Permian and Guyana is obviously performing very, very well with both of those boats running at above capacity. Yes. I would just add to that the 8-K was really looking at what the market factors are. And then to the extent within the business, we're working hard to improve upon that through the optimization that Kathy mentioned through revenue management across that entire value chain and then trading. And as trading moves and with the accounting rules as that booking happens with time, that comes in less than ratable. We saw that in this margin bucket this quarter. And that will move around as we move forward depending on the price environment that we're in. Yes. The -- so we reached an agreement with the workers some time ago and those refineries are basically going back through the start-up process. When those refineries strike, we've got to bring those units down and free them of hydrocarbon. And so that's a fairly thorough process of cleaning out the hydrocarbon -- clearing the hydrocarbon.  So when we go to bring those back up, it's a fairly rigorous process of starting those back up to make sure we do that safely. So it takes some time to ramp things back up again. That's what the organization is working on. I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact. I mean, obviously, in a market that's short, any capacity that comes offline raises the overall prices within the industry. And so I think net-net, that will probably -- there's some mitigation there with respect to our other refineries that are up and running. So I don't think we'll see that in the results, frankly. Yes, sure. Well, I think the point you make are good ones. The market is tight. And I think generally, the industry -- there's not a lot of capacity as you look across the different steps required to bring on additional production. So I think that is tight. That will, obviously, with time loosen up a little bit. But I think, generally speaking, for the industry, it's constrained. Obviously, every company will have different degrees of freedom in that space. We have some degrees of freedom there, but I would just say we're staying very firmly grounded in our philosophy of making sure that the investments that we make generate high returns at low prices.  And so the capital discipline -- my definition of capital discipline is making sure that you spend money that's advantaged and has -- generates good returns even in the down cycle. We're going to stay grounded in that. And so anything that we do on the margin has to, first and foremost, meet that criteria, that it's robust to a wide range of price environments, and that we'd be happy irrespective of what prices we're seeing out the window.  We've got capacity to do that, frankly, and some space. So we will, on the margin, spend money to -- where we can see an opportunity to bring that on. But I wouldn't say -- if you look at kind of the range of CapEx that we've provided over the years, we gave ourselves that range, obviously, anticipated movement not only within the year, but across from 1 year to the next. And so we feel pretty good that -- in terms of the ranges that we've provided, our plans going forward are still very consistent with those ranges. And Kathy will spend more time talking about that in December when she takes you through the plan that we will get endorsed with the Board next month. Yes. Paul, I'll touch on that, and if Kathy's got anything to add, I'll let her jump in on the back. But what I would say is, and I think we talked about this some years ago that we were -- when we moved to the value chain constructs, when we combined our fuels marketing organization with our refining organization and start looking at optimizing value all along the value chain, the trading organization became a much more relevant channel with respect to optimization.  And so at that time, so back in 2018, we made the decision to invest more in trading and to change the approach there to optimize, to act as an optimization tool along all of our assets. And you may recall, we talked about asset-backed trading. And that continues to be an important part of the Product Solutions business, and more specifically, the Downstream element of the business as well as our Upstream crude. And so that organization has grown with time and continues to perform that optimization function.  I think what you're seeing this quarter, in particular, is the point that Kathy made, which is with the way you account for trading, that can be kind of noisy quarter-on-quarter. And that if you look longer term, you can see the value kind of embedded within the businesses. And it is, I would say, very embedded within those businesses. So we don't break it out just because it is an asset-backed trading strategy. And therefore, the value derived through that, obviously, is through trading, but obviously, also through running all our refineries reliably, having the product and having the assets to support the arbitrages and the trade activities that under -- that create that value.  This quarter we saw with the way that the prices moved, a bigger chunk of it booked in the quarter. But I would just say, as you look at that over time, it is a meaningful contributor to the value equation in our Downstream value chain. That's why we've tried to break that out with the price timing. Yes. I'll touch on that, Neal. I mean, obviously, we're subject to the same broad market forces that everyone is seeing out there and so inflationary pressures across a number of our sectors and activities. I think a couple of things. One is, as you will recall, as we went through the pandemic in the downturn, we were very -- took a very concerted effort to work with our contracting partners and the recognition that we would be back, that we would longer term, be running rigs and putting pipe in the ground. And so tried to enter into contracts that reflected that longer term objective, and that has helped manage some of the inflationary impacts and that we kind of set some contracts back in the downturn with a commitment to continue to spend money going forward.  And so that's been an offset. And then, of course, the organization, with all the changes that we've been making. Remember, we took our Upstream organization from 7 plus businesses down to 1 and organized very, very differently. We've centralized a lot of the functions, really trying to harness our scale and leverage the purchasing power that we have and then cut our costs out. So all those efforts to become more efficient and more effective in the marketplace and reduce costs are having a significant impact.  We mentioned in the earnings release that to date, we have $6.4 billion of structural savings versus 2019 and we're well on our way to meeting the objective we set by end 2023 of $9 billion in structural savings. So that's helping to offset some of those inflationary pressures. And then on top of that, with the centralized organizations and more effectively leveraging the scale, we're getting what I would call -- what we term as kind of short-term efficiencies, purchasing power, however you want to think about that, that we don't put in the structural bucket, but actually helps us to offset costs.  And so we've challenged ourselves to deliver on our expense budget for the year and to offset inflation. The organization is doing a pretty good job at that. I think we'll be within rounding with respect to that. And then next year, the organization is very focused on using the opportunities that have been created through the restructuring of our business to offset those inflationary pressures. And we're going to stretch ourselves to see how much of that we can do. Yes. Thanks, Roger. I think the industry has been historically pretty good at flexing on capacity to meet the demand. And so I'm optimistic that with time, the market -- and we've proven this, I think, over the years, that the markets will come back into balance, but it is a function of time.  I think in the short term, everyone will squeeze what they can. Certainly, you've seen us pushing as hard as we can to make sure that we're running reliably, and we're getting product to the marketplace to meet that need in the market. I know everyone else is trying to do the same. So I think that piece of it is sweating all the existing assets as hard as you can. It's going to help in the short term, but longer -- but more structurally, it's just a function of getting these projects developed and on track.  I mean fortunately for us, we've had a very healthy pipeline of projects that have been in work. And so it's not -- we're not out trying to find something to work on. We're basically focused on delivering the pipeline that we've got. And we're bringing on -- as we talked about, we brought in Coral floating LNG out of Mozambique this quarter. That's additional capacity. We're progressing investments in Papua New Guinea. We've got Golden Pass here in the U.S., that's progressing very large LNG export terminal that should come online in 2024. That's going to probably increase the exports out of the Gulf Coast by 20%. So I think the capacity is there. It's just a function of the time it takes to build these very significant projects.  And I would also tell you that if you look at on the crude side of the equation, we're making very good progress with the next poke into Guyana. We continue to believe we're going to bring that in a little bit early and we're progressing the ones after that. So I think the capacity is there. It's -- the challenge is executing efficiently so that you're getting -- you're spending your capital efficiently and then doing it in a way that brings it on an expedited fashion, which is what we're focused on doing."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining Exxon Mobil's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me today are: Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Our quarterly presentation with prerecorded remarks was posted earlier today on the Investors section of our website, along with the second quarter earnings news release. During our live 1-hour conference call, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from the earlier presentation before we move to the question-and-answer period. May I remind you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. We also have provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, including reconciliation. Now please turn to Slide 3, and we'll turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter operational and financial results were very strong. While the market has clearly been a factor, our results reflect our focus on the fundamentals as well as plans and investments we put in motion several years ago and stuck with through the depths of the pandemic. They also reflect the outstanding work of our teams across the world to operate our facility safely at high utilization levels, which drove needed production and throughput. We are proud of their commitment to supplying the energy and products the world needs and delivering on our strategic priorities. Increased production, higher realizations and aggressive cost control generated strong earnings and cash flow. We also delivered excellent safety and operating performance. As global demand recovers, we continued to invest in our portfolio and grew our year-to-date production in the Permian by about 130,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day versus the first half of 2021. For the full year, in the Permian, we expect to achieve 25% production growth for the second consecutive year. In Guyana, our total capacity is now more than 340,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.  Our Liza Phase 1 development is producing above design capacity with excellent performance. Liza Phase 2 started production earlier this year and has recently reached the design capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. As demand has continued to recover, so is production from our industry-leading refining circuit. We increased throughput by 180,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2021.  We continue to demonstrate our value as an essential partner during the quarter. For example, Exxon Mobil has recently been awarded an interest in Qatar's North Field East expansion. We have worked closely with the Qataris for decades. This attractive agreement further leverages our experience as a global leader in LNG, giving us the opportunity to help grow Qatar's LNG capacity by 30 million tons per annum by 2026. Partnerships such as these are also an important part of unlocking future opportunities in our new businesses like carbon capture and storage. We recently signed multiple MOUs to explore the development of large-scale CCS projects in China, Australia, the Netherlands and Indonesia. Lastly, we further strengthened our portfolio by advancing a significant refining capacity expansion on the U.S. Gulf Coast, discovering new resources in Guyana, progressing LNG production in Mozambique and addressing noncore assets with announced divestments totaling more than $3 billion. We continue to invest through the pandemic with the understanding that demand would recover. With the Beaumont refinery expansion, we're on pace to increase our refining capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast by more than 17% or 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we also announced 2 discoveries in Guyana, adding to the estimated recoverable resource base, which is nearly 11 billion barrels. Natural gas began flowing at the Coral LNG project offshore Mozambique. The project remains on track to achieve the first LNG cargo later this year. Finally, we progressed our divestment program at an advantageous point in the cycle, announced asset sales include XTO Energy Canada, our Romanian Upstream affiliate and our Barnett Shale gas assets. Barnett Shell divestment closed in the second quarter. The other 2 are anticipated to close later this year, subject to regulatory approvals.  Overall, it was a very strong quarter in both financial results and in progressing our strategic priorities. The strong second quarter results reflect a tight global market environment where demand has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels and supply has attrited. The situation was made worse by the events in Ukraine, which have contributed to increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. In the first quarter, average Brent crude prices rose by about $22 per barrel. In the second quarter, Brent crude prices moved up by another $12 per barrel, pushing the benchmark marginally above the 10-year range. Natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges amid ongoing concerns about European supply. Refining margins are even more pronounced versus the 10-year range. They remain at very high levels, reflecting the significant impact on refining capacity resulting from the pandemic. In July, we saw some relief as margins moderated with improved supply and demand balances.  Global Chemical margins in contrast remain near the bottom of the cycle. However, we did see a slight improvement in the quarter, mainly in Asia Pacific. Margins in North America tightened during the quarter as product prices continue to lag the steep increases in ethane feedstock cost, consistent with higher gas prices. Before recapping our financial results, let me touch on the market environment that underpins them. As I mentioned in my prerecorded remarks, large annual investments in oil and gas production are required to offset normal depletion, even more is required to grow net production. Prior to the pandemic, industry investments were below historical levels. The economy-wide shutdowns during the pandemic exacerbated the problem. We are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. We clearly see the tightness in supply in refining, where the closure rate during the pandemic was 3x the rate of the 2008 financial crisis. Given the long investment cycle times, growing supply will not happen overnight. At ExxonMobil, throughout this period, we stayed focused on the fundamentals and led our IOC peers in oil and gas investment. We leaned in when others leaned out, including investments in U.S. refining capacity, notably with our Beaumont refinery expansion.  Our investments over the last 5 years are paying off today and helping to meet the needs of families everywhere with greater supply than otherwise would be the case. While progressing investments in our traditional businesses, we are also advancing a portfolio of opportunities consistent with our core capabilities in low-carbon solutions. We expect that these 2 will pay off in the years ahead for our shareholders and for our environment. With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the second quarter financial results. Earnings totaled nearly $18 billion on increased production, higher liquids and natural gas realizations and strong refining margins. We continue to drive efficiencies with $6 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019. We remain on track to achieve more than $9 billion in savings by 2023. CapEx was $4.6 billion in the quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. We remain on track for our full year CapEx guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $20 billion, further strengthening our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to about 13%, while the growth ratio is now at 20%, at the low end of our target range. We returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The increase in distribution reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and renewed strength of our balance sheet. I'll conclude with a few key takeaways. As I mentioned earlier, we are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. Our strong performance reflects the sizable investments we've been making over the past several years and our focus on the fundamentals. Those 2 things put us in a great position to deliver increased production at a time when the world needs it most. We're continuing to increase production of low-cost barrels in Guyana and the Permian. We're doing all of this while maximizing output of our existing facilities, including a new daily production record set by PNG LNG in July. Our new Corpus Christi complex was cash and earnings positive in the first half of the year with the world-scale steam cracker demonstrating design capacity. Our U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity is poised to increase by about 250,000 barrels per day with the start-up of the Beaumont refinery expansion project in the first quarter of 2023. Two new LNG projects are also advancing. Coral LNG and Mozambique is set to deliver its first cargo in the second half of this year. Our Golden Pass LNG project, which will provide 18 million tons per year of new LNG supplies, remains on schedule to start up in 2024. Once completed, Golden Pass will increase LNG from the Gulf Coast by 20%. In addition, we continue to divest nonstrategic assets at an opportune point in the cycle. We delivered strong safety and reliability while controlling costs. These moves are improving our asset mix, lowering our breakevens and boosting our resiliency. Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to grow our portfolio of opportunities with the 4 newly announced carbon capture and storage opportunities in Australia, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands. I'm extremely proud of the work our people are doing. All of their efforts are consistent with our strategic priorities, which our shareholders are being rewarded for. Today, with an even stronger balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest and to drive shareholder returns throughout the cycles. Our focus on the fundamentals is unchanged. We continue to leverage our core capabilities to advance our strategic priorities and to make the investments needed in this long-cycle business. With our constancy of purpose and consistent approach, we will successfully address the dual challenge, providing energy and products modern societies need while lowering society's greenhouse gas emissions, leading industry in the energy transition. Thank you.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren. [Operator Instructions]. With that, Jennifer, could you open up the line for questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: One macro question and then one micro question, Darren. I want to continue on the theme of energy security. -- and you're one of the largest energy providers in Europe. And so I would love your perspective on the European energy challenges that are being faced right now. How does the continent ultimately work its way through it -- and what is ExxonMobil's role in providing energy to the region?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Well, Neil, I think you're touching on what is a very challenging situation today. And that reflects, I think, the complexity associated with making a massive change to a system that's so critically important to people's lives. And so I think going forward and what we're seeing happening today is a, what I'd say, is a broader net being cast with respect to how we think about the transition and how that evolves. Making sure that we've got a diversified portfolio of energy and one -- and sources of energy that are not dependent on any one nation state, which is, I think, an important step that we're seeing being taken. I think there'll be a drive over time to make sure that they're leveraging the resources available to them. And I'll just make one example would be the potential that we see for fracking and unconventional gas in Germany. I think the industry has proven over the years that unconventional gas can be produced safely and you then have a secure source of supply and economically and reliable source of supply. And so I think there's an opportunity where certainly, Exxon Mobil could play a key role. We also have a fairly large refining footprint in Europe. We've been working hard to upgrade those facilities, make sure that we're driving their emissions footprints to zero and developing plans to do that. And within this current crisis, have really stepped up the efforts to reduce our consumption of natural gas. In fact, if you look at our refining circuit, we reduced the use of natural gas by 65%. And -- that's the equivalent gas use for about -- for powering about 2 million homes in Europe. And so there are some substantial steps that we can take with respect to optimizing our current operation. Longer term, we're opening up -- looking at projects to expand our LNG import facilities. And of course, we are bringing LNG projects online. We've got the Golden Pass project here in the U.S., which will allow us to export LNG from the U.S. into Europe. And so we've got Mozambique, and that's coming on the back end of this year. And of course, we've got work going on in PNG. And so bringing more LNG supplies to help offset some of the Russian gas going into Europe will be another really critical step forward and the diversification of supplies for Europe.\nNeil Mehta: And the follow-up is around capital returns. Just talk through how you're thinking about the dividend where there hasn't been a reset this year at least and whether it makes sense to return back to dividend growth and return of capital, a very strong buyback number in the quarter. How are you thinking about tracking towards the $30 billion that you outlined a couple of months ago?\nKathryn Mikells: Sure. I'm happy to take that. So look, as you know, our first priority is to continue to invest in the business. And we talked last quarter about the fact that we expect it to build our cash balance to between $20 billion to $30 billion, which gives us both a strong balance sheet and a strong cash balance, which we view as a competitive advantage that provides us flexibility through the cycle. We're trying to strike the right balance in terms of share repurchases and dividends. As you know, we raised our quarterly dividend by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2021. And last quarter, we tripled the size of our share repurchase plan, which is now up to $30 billion of share repurchases this year and next.  So we're definitely focused on being efficient as we look to return capital to shareholders. And obviously, the share repurchase program has a secondary benefit of reducing the nominal size of our dividend. So I'd say we're trying to strike the right balance. Our Board reviews this pretty regularly, and we feel good about where we're at right now.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you. And just a reminder, a single question per analyst, please. Jennifer?\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Darren, I wonder if I could ask first about natural gas in Europe. And specifically, your European gas production, obviously has come down a bit over the years, but it was some -- it was up sequentially in the second quarter when normally we see a seasonal downtrend for you guys in the summertime. Is this how we should think about your European gas production going forward that for obvious reasons, it's more of a flat line. And I wonder if you could address any specific issues around Groningen could be revisited by the Dutch government after given everything that's going on.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Doug, it's good to hear you again. With respect to demand, you're right. If you go back in time, under more normal circumstances, we do see a seasonal decline in the second quarter with gas demand, and that's historically been in the numbers, and we tend to foreshadow that in the first quarter, typically. This year, obviously, circumstances in Europe are very different, and we actually foreshadowed the first quarter that we didn't expect to see the same kind of seasonal dip because of the shortages that we were seeing in Europe at the time. And so I think going forward, obviously, a big question mark will be how the whole landscape and supply picture shapes up in Europe. And also, obviously, a big factor in gas demand will be weather. And so I think I wouldn't take this quarter as the new norm. I think we've just got to stay attuned to how the landscape develops there, what supply looks like and then obviously keep an eye on the weather. With respect to your question on Groningen, it's -- the capacity is there. It's something that the Dutch government obviously has control of and evaluates the circumstances and make decisions in terms of the production that they request our joint venture there NAM to produce. And so that will be a function of how the Dutch government kind of weighs off the demand for gas versus the supplies and the role they want Groningen to play. But the capacity is there.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. Kathy, I wonder, a very quick follow-up on Neil's question. I wonder if I could just ask very specifically, when you joined I seem to recall you expressing some concern of the absolute scale of the dividend burden. Now I realize there's a lot of operational cash flow growth in the future for Exxon. But when we think about the balances of buybacks, dividend policy and so on, is your objective to reduce that absolute dividend burden to help us kind of calibrate what that might look like going forward? And I'll leave it there.\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. So let me start with the Board and we are very focused on ensuring that we take an efficient approach in terms of how we're returning capital to shareholders. And obviously, share repurchases are a very efficient way to do that. As we look at the dividend, I'd say there's a number of things that we continue to evaluate. I mean clearly, we think it's pretty critical that we have a competitive dividend. And today, we think we do have a competitive dividend. We do look at that nominal level of the dividend and share repurchases do have a secondary benefit of reducing that level. But I'd also tell you, importantly, all the actions we're taking in the business reduce our breakevens, right? We talked about that a lot at Investor Day. Our breakeven came down to $41 a barrel from $44 kind of last year. We have a trajectory as we looked at the plan that we presented at Investor Day and based on that price set to kind of bring our breakevens down farther to $35 a barrel. So that just builds more resiliency in the business, which makes I'd say, the overall kind of dividend much easy for the company to both sustain and in the future to grow. So that is how we look at it and how we think about that. And as I said previously, we're trying to strike the right balance in terms of growing that dividend and doing buybacks, which have the secondary benefit of reducing that nominal dividend, and they also are a very efficient way for us to return capital to shareholders. And then I'd say, importantly, we want to make sure we're taking an approach as it relates to our cash balance and our overall balance sheet that enables us to sustain both investments and shareholder returns through the cycle. That is how we generate the highest value for shareholders. And so we're very focused on doing that. \nDoug Leggate: Breakeven point is very [salient] (ph).\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: I wanted to ask about the Permian business specifically, and you continue to post strong results there. And there were some comments in the posted prepared remarks, I think a bit of an acceleration or increase in activity broadly in short cycle in the back half of the year. And I think that's referencing the Permian specifically. So I just wondering if you could comment if that reference refers to an acceleration activity versus your prior plans? And then also, as you think about the outlook over the next several years, can you talk a little bit about some of the inflationary trends that you're seeing in the shale business and then also the ability to offset that with efficiency gains?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Devin, I'll touch on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. With respect to Permian, the plan that we laid out some time ago, and we're currently executing is -- hasn't changed, and we had a very slight ramp-up as we head through the year, but nothing significantly different than what we have been doing. The plans that we have in place should deliver, and our current production is in line with that 25% growth versus last year, which, as you know, was on top of 25% growth the year before. And as we saw on the package, if you look at our tight oil production in the U.S. versus 2017, we expect to end 2022 at 3x the level of production. So I would say the strategy remains in place, the plans that we're actually getting remains in place. We're looking for opportunities within the construct that we define to extend and expand the activities. But frankly, given the tightness in the market, the availability of rigs, there's not a whole lot of opportunity to move there. And maybe I'll ask Kathy to cover the inflationary topic.\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. So overall, I'd say we feel really good about how we're managing inflation to date. Our overall structural cost savings kind of plan and program is very much on track. As of this quarter, we're now at $6 billion in overall savings kind of relative to 2019. So we're feeling pretty good about that. As we look at our kind of cost on a year-over-year basis, we obviously had a kind of seasonal increase in costs sequentially as we had a little bit more planned maintenance activity, but we feel very good that we're executing consistent with our plans and that we remain on track. We're obviously not immune to inflation. We did a great job certainly during the pandemic, especially when you think about our kind of longer projects that our global project group was executing in terms of ensuring that we were at that point in time when we were in a deflationary environment, really working hard with our service providers to extend contracts and looking to revised schedules associated with some of our projects but still moving the engineering forward on those things so that we could spool them up as the market environment improves. So we feel good about where we're at with our CapEx programs overall, and we feel good about the cost savings that we've -- that we're driving. I'd also say it isn't always going to look exactly the same kind of quarter-to-quarter. We obviously just made some significant changes in our organizational structure that were put in place in April. Those will, over time, also drive additional efficiencies for us. And we are working at constant, I'd say, pipeline in this area to ensure that we're both driving greater efficiency across the business, but also effectiveness, which is equally important. So I'd say we feel really good about where we're at.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Richardson: Great. Darren, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the refining outlook. It's probably a more volatile environment than we've seen in a long time, certainly with less Asian exports are certainly out of China and what's going on in Europe. So I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about that and based on your background, some insights there would be helpful.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Happy to do that, Stephen. Thanks for calling in. Yes, you say it's a volatile area. I think the thing that's really changed in the refining landscape, which has impacted -- we're seeing that impact across a lot of industries and parts of our business is the pandemic. If you go back since 2020 and as we've mentioned in our prepared presentation, 3 million barrels a day of refining capacity has come out of the circuit since the pandemic. And what has typically happened, which is 3x the rate of historical levels. And typically, historical levels have been offset by new builds coming in. And of course, a lot of those new builds got pushed out because of the pandemic and the lack of revenue in the extremely negative and poor refining margins. And so we've created this hole with a lot more capacity coming off-line without a whole lot of new capacity, typically out and developing in parts of the world in Asia and the Middle East. That capacity is not coming on. So we've got this gap, demand recovers, and we don't have the capacity to meet that, which has led to a record, record-high refining margins. So I think the solution there is with time for additional capacity to come on. We're pleased that we had justified a fairly large expansion in our Beaumont refinery. Essentially, based on transportation differentials that generated a reasonable return with potential upsides in times of tight markets, which obviously we're going to be seeing as we bring this refinery expansion on. It's the biggest expansion over a decade in the U.S. And it's one that takes advantage of the utilities and the units that we already have and the connection that we have with the Permian. So a very advantaged project coming onto the market at a really good time. Outside of that, I don't see a whole lot of additional expansions here in the U.S. And then as we mentioned in the presentation, over the next 2 years, probably 1 million barrels a day of capacity, including the 2 50 at our site coming on in the marketplace, which is still fairly short of the capacity that came off. And so our view is we're going to see what I say, the tighter supply and demand balance. One of the real question marks out there is what happens with demand. I would tell you, even at 2019 levels, the market is relatively tight. And so I expect a tighter market and maybe elevated margins versus what the historical norm is. But I would expect much lower than what we've experienced here in the second quarter. But -- and then with time, we'll see that capacity come back on out in Asia and the Middle East. And the world market is very efficient, and those barrels will flow to the demand centers and balance things off. And so I think this will be a few year price environment, and we'll get back to what I think is a more typical refining industry structure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Question maybe just moving to the asset side of things on Guyana. Exxon has had really tremendous success there and not only just from a resource perspective. Are we at the point where we should be maybe adjusting our thinking on what time lines are just given the really good execution that you've had so far? I guess, where we're going at is each phase has come on faster, capacity is creeping up in the meantime and infill opportunities, they continue to look really promising. So at what point should we kind of be compressing time lines?\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Jeanine. Well, you're right, we have seen really good progress in what's happening on Guyana. I think it illustrates one of the advantages of a consistency of approach and just moving from one development to the other. We started off with Liza 1 with a smaller concept to get started and recognize that we would build on that and extend on the design that we had. So we had a concept of design one, build many. Obviously, as our discoveries mature and we get a better understanding of the reservoir and the development opportunities there, we will adjust those designs. So I think it's a function of really the development plans that we put in place and the right project to most efficiently deliver -- to develop those resources, and that will change as we move around that block and with the different structures and resources. So I wouldn't say, I think stay tuned as our plans mature and we get a better line of sight to it. We'll give you updates and let you know how we see that coming. I think with Payara, we did bring that one forward and announced that recently given the progress we're making. And as we continue to progress the other ones, we'll update you and the rest of the market on how we see those things coming together. But I'm very encouraged and feel good about the progress we're making and hope to see continued advancement in bringing those projects forward faster.\nOperator: We'll move next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: My question is on the low carbon side. The earnings release had a nice reminder of the list of projects you've announced and what you're involved in. Earlier this week, we had a bill drafted in Senate that addressed the key categories in low carbon for you, which are carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels. And so now that you've said as you scope the low carbon business, you're not interested in sort of reacting to policy, you want to be ahead of things and you want to try to anticipate some of the incentives that come down. So I wonder if this bill is aligned with what you had anticipated. If assuming it passes, if you think we're in the zone where your efforts here are really going to be supported or if you think there's more work to do or other regions where there might be better opportunities in the U.S.?\nDarren Woods: Sure. No, thanks for your question. I think it's very timely and relevant. What I would say is, and what we've been talking about is we're pleased with the broader recognition that a more comprehensive set of solutions are going to be needed to address the challenges of an energy transition. And so the discussion evolving from just wind and solar and EVs to carbon capture, storage and biofuels and hydrogen is really important. And the recognition globally and with governments, particularly our government, that those are important technologies that need to be developed. And importantly, the markets need to be catalyzed and early investments incentivized, we think, is a really important development. And so while we -- I'm not real familiar with what's in the legislation since it's just come out, I think it is encouraging to see the recognition and the desire to try to catalyze investments in this space because as we've said, we think they're going to be absolutely critical for society to achieve its longer-term ambitions and to make significant reductions commissions. And so it's a step in the right direction. Our portfolio, we're trying to develop a diversified approach. We've got many of the projects within the portfolio that reduce our own emissions and do it economically. The total returns at about 10% on that portfolio. And of course, Dan running low carbon solutions working hard to improve on that. And then we've got other large projects that where we anticipate incentives coming in either through the market or through policy that we started the planning and development on so that as that policy develops, we'll have a project radian moving into execution. Blue hydrogen is one where that will be beneficial if those incentives come to pass, given the concept that we have there.  So I'd say generally a step in the right direction. I would also tell you, moving beyond the U.S. and more broadly looking around the world, a much more significant and serious effort in terms of looking for opportunities in the carbon capture, hydrogen, ammonia space and the biofuel space. And I've been pleased at the interest for governments all around the world and partners all around the world to engage with Exxon Mobil and to leverage the capabilities that we can bring to the space to help develop large-scale projects that make significant reductions and emissions. So I'd say really positive vectors in this space, and we feel good about how we're positioned.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: I wanted to ask about the current investment environment just given what's going on geopolitically in Russia. And I think there's 2 schools of thought out there, one that this is kind of accelerating a push to invest in new lower carbon energy because the current energy system has all these geopolitical risks. And another one that, in fact, we need to invest in more hydrocarbons because the world is clearly short that. So I'm just hoping you could kind of frame broadly where you think the industry, government, how the conversations have gone and if you think the crisis that we're currently in is accelerating the push towards greener energy or hydrocarbons?\nDarren Woods: You bet, Jason. I think the short answer is yes. It's incentivizing, I think, both of those. And I think that's appropriate to look where there's an opportunity to take advantage of what I'll call the natural endowments in terms of sun and wind to deploy those technologies and renewable technologies to generate power. But at the same time, I think there's a recognition that there are deficiencies in those technologies. And while they offer an important solution and are necessary, they're not sufficient. And so I think at the same time, a recognition that we need to do more, particularly with gas given its cleaner footprint.  And I think a recognition as it was just speaking with Sam about, that the challenge here is emissions. Not oil and gas itself, it's the combustion of oil and gas and the emissions associated with that. And so dealing with emissions through carbon capture and storage is another opportunity to address the problem at a much lower cost and in a much quicker time frame. And so my sense and the conversations I'm having with governments around the world is a recognition of this broader approach, a basket of technologies are going to be needed and emphasis should be put on all the ones for the right reasons at the right time and consciously and explicitly recognizing the deficiencies and making sure that we're mitigating those deficiencies. It was just in Europe and having a conversation with some of the government leaders there and clearly recognize the challenge associated with renewables, wind and solar and the intermittency issue and a recognition that gas and gas fired power gen will be an important backstop to address that. So I think there's a much more holistic approach being taken and a more thoughtful one. And I think that's encouraging.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Just one quick follow-up and then one question. So the follow-up is on grown again. I understand it's a government decision, but you talked about the technical capacity to increase volumes there. Are you able to quantify what is the capacity because in the past, that field has produced sort of up to 50 Bcm historically, many, many years ago. And then the question I had is on your comments on Liza. You mentioned the first phase was producing above design capacity. I asked a few quarters ago about Papua New Guinea, which is also producing above capacity, and you have quite a good track record there of increasing the nameplate capacity more than once. So could you talk about the opportunity at Liza? And potentially quantify how far above capacity you could go for the additional units? Because presumably, your targets are based on design capacity only. But it'd be good to get some color on that.\nDarren Woods: Yes. You bet, Raj. What I would say is on Groningen, there's significant capacity there. Obviously, there's a balance that has to be struck and I know the Dutch government is very focused on responsible production there as are we. And so I think it won't be a limit of the capacity. It will more be a limit as to what the government thinks is necessary to produce given the circumstances there. So I don't know that there's a -- I wouldn't think of it as a capacity limit with respect to the facilities that we have there, but more of what do we want to do to try to balance the risk and the rewards associated with production out of that field. On the expansion and going above design capacity, I would tell you, been very, very pleased and frankly, proud of the organization and the work they've done really across the entire portfolio. You mentioned Liza and PNG, which are both really good examples and the ones that we've highlighted. But I would tell you, almost all the new projects that we're bringing on, as we line those out and get them up and running, the teams get very quickly focused on debottlenecking and optimizing and taking it above production capacity. And so I think we've got a long history of that. I think the way we have organized our technology and engineering organization now where we can leverage the learnings and capabilities and competencies every part of the organization on to any one particular asset is a huge, huge competitive leverage. And in fact, that's part of the improvements that we're seeing. In fact, at PNG, we brought downstream -- historical downstream optimization technology into that upstream traditional upstream facility, and that's making a big difference seeing that across a number of different platforms. So I don't have a new number to give you in terms of how to think about these. I would just tell you that you should feel comfortable that the organization to push and strive for getting the most -- the kit that we build and the projects that we bring online. And we'll give you updates as we're moving through here on the organization, successful with that to let you know how we're doing and growing that production.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Could you say how far about capacity Liza 1 is producing?\nDarren Woods: 10% above.\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. Maybe coming back to a couple of the policy questions that have been asked. Do you have a Slide 5 in the presentation, right, shows investment maybe where it should be versus where it is and where it's projected. And then I'm just curious, as we think about some of the policy you talked about maybe checking the box of all of the above as you're meeting with various governments.  Would that allow the global investment to get back on the track necessary as we look out over several years? And if not, wouldn't that indicate that we're going to be looking at multiple years of above normal or above, let's call it, mid-cycle commodity prices? Because when I think about a $41 breakeven, maybe a $60, $65 mid-cycle, but an underinvestment situation that says oil prices are likely to exceed that. Doesn't that set up Exxon very well to, I think, one of the questions asked earlier, be more aggressive on the cash returns front. Just curious how you think that sliding together.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Well, I think, Roger, it's a complicated space you're asking about, but a good one. I do think if over time, policymakers focus on what I think the real challenge with the energy transition is, which is dealing with emissions and the broader door opens for, say, carbon capture and storage or hydrogen and specifically blue hydrogen that, that opens up the door for additional oil and gas and the receptiveness of oil and gas coming on the marketplace, which I think frankly, is important just given the costs associated with the transition. If you can find ways to use existing infrastructure and don't have to rewire your entire industrial processes and power generation systems, that's going to be a win for society as we bring down emissions. And so that may open the door. I think that will just -- time will tell. And if that does, obviously, the demand changes. And maybe that incentivizes more investment and get you back into the range that's shown on the chart. From our perspective, what will change our investment is finding these advantaged opportunities. I think our view has been and continues to be that we're going to look for the opportunities where we can leverage the capabilities and competitive advantage of the corporation and generate above-industry average returns. The portfolio we've been advancing does that. We've got others that we're working on potential opportunities in the pipeline that we think will do that. And so as we are successful at securing those opportunities or developing them, you'll see those come into the portfolio. And frankly, the size of that investment will be a function of kind of how big those -- or the number of those projects that we find that are advantaged are. So that's kind of the -- how I would summarize it.\nRoger Read: Can I just ask one kind of clarification on that. If you think about -- and I understand you're doing a lot of things in a lot of different places. But if you think about your investment relative to those various lines, right? What's projected, what's necessary and where Exxon is today? Where do you feel Exxon hits on that curve?\nDarren Woods: Well, I would say, Rog, you've got to put what we're doing today and what we've got plan going forward in the context of what we've been doing over the last 5 years. You will recall back in 2018, we talked about aggressively investing in these opportunities and doing it countercyclically. While others were pulling back, we were leaning in. And that meant that we spent -- and you will recall this, I got a lot of pressure on this and criticism is spending that money upfront out of the cycle, which I think is paying off today. I think that was the right strategy is not to ramp up spending in the heat of the moment or the heat of the market. And so that strategy is paying off. You've got to look across that type cycle and I would say, aggregate the investments that we've been making. My expectation is we'll see -- we'll continue to see cycles in this industry. We're going to continue to look for the opportunities, particularly in the down cycle to bring advantaged investments forward. And that's the way we're going to be thinking about and looking at it.\nOperator: Go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: Darren, my question is, again, on shareholder returns. Specifically, given the massive amount of cash, you don't have the post the nice quarterly cash flow. Would you all consider externally ramping up some more of the shorter cycle return assets like your Permian position given based on our number, what looks like to be notable discounts that many of the independent producers are trading at spread?\nDarren Woods: Yes. So in terms of our organic opportunities in the Permian, it will -- we're not going to step outside of the strategy that we developed in terms of driving capital-efficient production in the Permian. You'll recall we've talked about the corridor approach that we're pursuing in the Delaware. The fact that we've pre-invested in facilities there. We've got a very aggressive technology program that we've been working on for some time now. That's being built and brought into our production and drilling there. And one of the reasons why we're seeing some of the advances and cost and efficiency is driven by a lot of that work we've been doing in the technology space. We've got more technology that we're looking to bring into that. And so that's helping the development and the productivity of that development. We don't want to get too far ahead of that. So there are a lot of parameters that we're keeping an eye on to make sure that we deliver on our commitments to produce there at very low cost, have very low breakevens and high cash flow. That's the way we're thinking about it.\nNeal Dingmann: But no thoughts like we did in '17 rate. I do think '17 buying -- externally buying other assets in the permit outside of the largest position you already have?\nDarren Woods: I think we are always looking for acquisition opportunities. That has been -- that's always on the radar. And as you know, the key secret or the key advantage there you got to find is assets that fit with your advantages that you can bring additional value and improve value through an acquisition. So absolutely, that remains on the radar. I think as we work these technologies, as we advance our processes and techniques, that opens up additional advantage, which we can then look at and apply to other potential opportunities. So that's kind of the formula that we have there, and we're keeping our eyes open.\nOperator: We'll go next to Manav Gupta with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nManav Gupta: My quick question here is we are hearing some worries on -- where we have a debate if U.S. is in a recession or not in a recession globally, also the same debate. I'm just trying to understand whether it's your refining business or your chemicals business? Are you seeing any early signs of recessionary demand kicking in or demand destruction whether it relates to the refining business or maybe your commodity chemical business? If you could help us understand how demand is trending in somewhat of a challenging GDP or global economic data.\nDarren Woods: Sure, Manav. I'll take a crack at that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. I think certainly, the dialogue that I've heard externally in this space is it's a complex picture to try to dissect to understand. And of course, the debate are we in a recession on a recession, I think, is in part a factor of this complicated landscape that we're looking at. I would say within our industry, it's no less complicated when you think about a lot of the supply constraints, some logistics challenges that we're facing. So it's difficult to get a really clear read on what's driving variation demand quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month given some of those logistics challenges that we're seeing inventory withdrawals and builds. And so a complicated space. I think bottom line is I wouldn't tell you that we're seeing something that would say we are in a recession or a near recession. But I would also say that it's a complex picture, frankly. The demand destruction question that you asked, I wouldn't tie and what we have seen is, obviously, earlier this year as prices really spiked up there is a level of discretionary demand, and we saw some of that demand come off with very high prices. As prices have come back down again, you're seeing some of that recover. And so I would say that's just the normal price response that you see with respect to demand and not tied to, say, a more macroeconomic picture.  I don't know, Kathy, if you have anything to add?\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. The only other thing I would add to that is, overall, when you look at demand recovering from the lows of the pandemic. One of the laggards has been jet, obviously. And so jet continues to lag, but is obviously starting to pick up now as people are starting to travel and obviously, international travel restrictions have reduced, which means people are also starting to travel a bit more internationally. But we continue to also see some effects of COVID. The fact that China was in lockdowns in the second quarter certainly kind of impacted our chemicals business a little bit, right? And so we saw a bit of our volumes coming off there, specifically in Asia, responding to that. So there's going to continue to be these impacts, both the ongoing recovery from the pandemic. And then obviously, some COVID impacts and now kind of intersecting with a bit more uncertainty associated with just the overall macro environment. The last thing I'd say is we tend to be an organization that prepares for the worst and hopes for the best. So I'd tell you, we're certainly preparing for every eventuality.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: My question is on the chemicals business. I know you've had some headwinds in 2Q from both a margin and a volume perspective. You had called out China lockdown specifically, and that piece might be a little tough to forecast. But can you speak to your outlook there for the second half in both the U.S. and globally in the Chemicals business?\nDarren Woods: Sure. I'll start off on that and then see if Kathy wants to add anything. I would tell you, what we're seeing here in the second quarter and we made reference to is while the ethane advantage that we have in the U.S., North America still is an advantage versus the rest of the world as gas prices go up and crude prices moderate and more naphthas out there. That advantage weekends, and we saw that with respect to the margin. But still reasonably healthy demand and good demand growth year-on-year. China obviously is an important market. And so as we move in and out of lockdowns there, that will have an impact on our chemicals demand. And the automotive market is an important market. And with some of the challenges they've had there with chips and production issues that has had in the short-term impacts, and we'll have to see how those get resolved. My expectation is as that gets resolved in automotive production, that was to pick up, we'd see that again, recover within our portfolio. So that's kind of the landscape that we see today and really be a function of where does China end up going with respect to its response to COVID. Kathy, anything to add?\nKathryn Mikells: Yes. The only thing I would add is, as we look forward, there are more supply coming on in chemicals specifically. And so we can see projects most of them are targeted in China, and China is obviously long term, one of the fastest-growing markets for chemicals, but we're also seeing some additional supply that's going to come on in North America. And this is obviously part of the cyclicality in the business. Supply tends to come on in large chunks, and it takes a little while for overall supply and demand to then come back in balance. So that's the only other thing that I would add.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thanks. I think we have time for one more question, Jen.\nOperator: Looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question will be from Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Yes. Maybe just one follow-up on some of the earlier comments on the low carbon businesses. On the carbon capture front, you called out a number of projects in the release, you're progressing in a number of those different projects around the world. As you look at these I mean, how would you describe the commonalities in these projects? What is and isn't working on carbon capture? Are there technical similarities that are driving progress in these locations or specific progress or projects, political or fiscal support? And what are some of the key things that you need to see either technically or regulatory-wise to kind of -- to grow this business further, I'd say.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I think if you look at today's technology, it has applicability. It's economic for more concentrated streams of CO2. As you move down the seriatum of emissions, so to speak, and the CO2 concentration becomes more and more dilute, that existing technology becomes more and more expensive. And I think that's one of the key challenges. And so one of the areas that we're working with our technology organizations is developments in technology that allow more economic capture of more diluted CO2 streams. And so I would say that's one constraint that's going to require technical advances to make it more affordable going forward. But outside that, within the streams that have the necessary concentration to make existing technology work, key variables will be storage and access to storage. And access to storage that's geographically close, logistically close because another key point will be the transportation cost. And so kind of requires concentrated streams of CO2, good logistics systems and storage -- abundant storage that's close by. You put those things together, you've got an equation that you can make these projects work with relatively modest incentive schemes. And in fact, that's what you're seeing with the Houston Hub carbon capture projects that we've tabled a very large source of somewhat concentrated CO2 streams that's logistically close to a good storage in the Gulf of Mexico. So all those equations come together. That require additional incentives, but something that would be reasonably inexpensive compared to the cost societies currently bearing to remove CO2. And as you move around the world, the projects that we're looking at have similar constructs to make that -- those projects viable. And then obviously, the governments are looking at what kind of policy would be required to help support those projects.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Ryan. Thank you, Darren. I think we're out of time. I appreciate everybody's questions today. We will post the transcript of the Q&A session on our investor website early next week. Have a nice weekend, everybody, and I'll turn it back to our operator to conclude our call, Jennifer.\nDarren Woods: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathryn Mikells",
            "content": "Sure. I'm happy to take that. So look, as you know, our first priority is to continue to invest in the business. And we talked last quarter about the fact that we expect it to build our cash balance to between $20 billion to $30 billion, which gives us both a strong balance sheet and a strong cash balance, which we view as a competitive advantage that provides us flexibility through the cycle. We're trying to strike the right balance in terms of share repurchases and dividends. As you know, we raised our quarterly dividend by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2021. And last quarter, we tripled the size of our share repurchase plan, which is now up to $30 billion of share repurchases this year and next.  So we're definitely focused on being efficient as we look to return capital to shareholders. And obviously, the share repurchase program has a secondary benefit of reducing the nominal size of our dividend. So I'd say we're trying to strike the right balance. Our Board reviews this pretty regularly, and we feel good about where we're at right now. Yes. So let me start with the Board and we are very focused on ensuring that we take an efficient approach in terms of how we're returning capital to shareholders. And obviously, share repurchases are a very efficient way to do that. As we look at the dividend, I'd say there's a number of things that we continue to evaluate. I mean clearly, we think it's pretty critical that we have a competitive dividend. And today, we think we do have a competitive dividend. We do look at that nominal level of the dividend and share repurchases do have a secondary benefit of reducing that level. But I'd also tell you, importantly, all the actions we're taking in the business reduce our breakevens, right? We talked about that a lot at Investor Day. Our breakeven came down to $41 a barrel from $44 kind of last year. We have a trajectory as we looked at the plan that we presented at Investor Day and based on that price set to kind of bring our breakevens down farther to $35 a barrel. So that just builds more resiliency in the business, which makes I'd say, the overall kind of dividend much easy for the company to both sustain and in the future to grow. So that is how we look at it and how we think about that. And as I said previously, we're trying to strike the right balance in terms of growing that dividend and doing buybacks, which have the secondary benefit of reducing that nominal dividend, and they also are a very efficient way for us to return capital to shareholders. And then I'd say, importantly, we want to make sure we're taking an approach as it relates to our cash balance and our overall balance sheet that enables us to sustain both investments and shareholder returns through the cycle. That is how we generate the highest value for shareholders. And so we're very focused on doing that. Yes. So overall, I'd say we feel really good about how we're managing inflation to date. Our overall structural cost savings kind of plan and program is very much on track. As of this quarter, we're now at $6 billion in overall savings kind of relative to 2019. So we're feeling pretty good about that. As we look at our kind of cost on a year-over-year basis, we obviously had a kind of seasonal increase in costs sequentially as we had a little bit more planned maintenance activity, but we feel very good that we're executing consistent with our plans and that we remain on track. We're obviously not immune to inflation. We did a great job certainly during the pandemic, especially when you think about our kind of longer projects that our global project group was executing in terms of ensuring that we were at that point in time when we were in a deflationary environment, really working hard with our service providers to extend contracts and looking to revised schedules associated with some of our projects but still moving the engineering forward on those things so that we could spool them up as the market environment improves. So we feel good about where we're at with our CapEx programs overall, and we feel good about the cost savings that we've -- that we're driving. I'd also say it isn't always going to look exactly the same kind of quarter-to-quarter. We obviously just made some significant changes in our organizational structure that were put in place in April. Those will, over time, also drive additional efficiencies for us. And we are working at constant, I'd say, pipeline in this area to ensure that we're both driving greater efficiency across the business, but also effectiveness, which is equally important. So I'd say we feel really good about where we're at. Yes. The only other thing I would add to that is, overall, when you look at demand recovering from the lows of the pandemic. One of the laggards has been jet, obviously. And so jet continues to lag, but is obviously starting to pick up now as people are starting to travel and obviously, international travel restrictions have reduced, which means people are also starting to travel a bit more internationally. But we continue to also see some effects of COVID. The fact that China was in lockdowns in the second quarter certainly kind of impacted our chemicals business a little bit, right? And so we saw a bit of our volumes coming off there, specifically in Asia, responding to that. So there's going to continue to be these impacts, both the ongoing recovery from the pandemic.

The last thing I'd say is we tend to be an organization that prepares for the worst and hopes for the best. So I'd tell you, we're certainly preparing for every eventuality. Yes. The only thing I would add is, as we look forward, there are more supply coming on in chemicals specifically.

And this is obviously part of the cyclicality in the business. Supply tends to come on in large chunks, and it takes a little while for overall supply and demand to then come back in balance. So that's the only other thing that I would add."

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter operational and financial results were very strong. While the market has clearly been a factor, our results reflect our focus on the fundamentals as well as plans and investments we put in motion several years ago and stuck with through the depths of the pandemic. They also reflect the outstanding work of our teams across the world to operate our facility safely at high utilization levels, which drove needed production and throughput. We are proud of their commitment to supplying the energy and products the world needs and delivering on our strategic priorities. Increased production, higher realizations and aggressive cost control generated strong earnings and cash flow. We also delivered excellent safety and operating performance. As global demand recovers, we continued to invest in our portfolio and grew our year-to-date production in the Permian by about 130,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day versus the first half of 2021. For the full year, in the Permian, we expect to achieve 25% production growth for the second consecutive year. In Guyana, our total capacity is now more than 340,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.  Our Liza Phase 1 development is producing above design capacity with excellent performance. Liza Phase 2 started production earlier this year and has recently reached the design capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. As demand has continued to recover, so is production from our industry-leading refining circuit. We increased throughput by 180,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2021.  We continue to demonstrate our value as an essential partner during the quarter. For example, Exxon Mobil has recently been awarded an interest in Qatar's North Field East expansion. We have worked closely with the Qataris for decades. This attractive agreement further leverages our experience as a global leader in LNG, giving us the opportunity to help grow Qatar's LNG capacity by 30 million tons per annum by 2026. Partnerships such as these are also an important part of unlocking future opportunities in our new businesses like carbon capture and storage. We recently signed multiple MOUs to explore the development of large-scale CCS projects in China, Australia, the Netherlands and Indonesia. Lastly, we further strengthened our portfolio by advancing a significant refining capacity expansion on the U.S. Gulf Coast, discovering new resources in Guyana, progressing LNG production in Mozambique and addressing noncore assets with announced divestments totaling more than $3 billion. We continue to invest through the pandemic with the understanding that demand would recover. With the Beaumont refinery expansion, we're on pace to increase our refining capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast by more than 17% or 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we also announced 2 discoveries in Guyana, adding to the estimated recoverable resource base, which is nearly 11 billion barrels. Natural gas began flowing at the Coral LNG project offshore Mozambique. The project remains on track to achieve the first LNG cargo later this year. Finally, we progressed our divestment program at an advantageous point in the cycle, announced asset sales include XTO Energy Canada, our Romanian Upstream affiliate and our Barnett Shale gas assets. Barnett Shell divestment closed in the second quarter. The other 2 are anticipated to close later this year, subject to regulatory approvals.  Overall, it was a very strong quarter in both financial results and in progressing our strategic priorities. The strong second quarter results reflect a tight global market environment where demand has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels and supply has attrited. The situation was made worse by the events in Ukraine, which have contributed to increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. In the first quarter, average Brent crude prices rose by about $22 per barrel. In the second quarter, Brent crude prices moved up by another $12 per barrel, pushing the benchmark marginally above the 10-year range. Natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges amid ongoing concerns about European supply. Refining margins are even more pronounced versus the 10-year range. They remain at very high levels, reflecting the significant impact on refining capacity resulting from the pandemic. In July, we saw some relief as margins moderated with improved supply and demand balances.  Global Chemical margins in contrast remain near the bottom of the cycle. However, we did see a slight improvement in the quarter, mainly in Asia Pacific. Margins in North America tightened during the quarter as product prices continue to lag the steep increases in ethane feedstock cost, consistent with higher gas prices. Before recapping our financial results, let me touch on the market environment that underpins them. As I mentioned in my prerecorded remarks, large annual investments in oil and gas production are required to offset normal depletion, even more is required to grow net production. Prior to the pandemic, industry investments were below historical levels. The economy-wide shutdowns during the pandemic exacerbated the problem. We are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. We clearly see the tightness in supply in refining, where the closure rate during the pandemic was 3x the rate of the 2008 financial crisis. Given the long investment cycle times, growing supply will not happen overnight. At ExxonMobil, throughout this period, we stayed focused on the fundamentals and led our IOC peers in oil and gas investment. We leaned in when others leaned out, including investments in U.S. refining capacity, notably with our Beaumont refinery expansion.  Our investments over the last 5 years are paying off today and helping to meet the needs of families everywhere with greater supply than otherwise would be the case. While progressing investments in our traditional businesses, we are also advancing a portfolio of opportunities consistent with our core capabilities in low-carbon solutions. We expect that these 2 will pay off in the years ahead for our shareholders and for our environment. With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the second quarter financial results. Earnings totaled nearly $18 billion on increased production, higher liquids and natural gas realizations and strong refining margins. We continue to drive efficiencies with $6 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019. We remain on track to achieve more than $9 billion in savings by 2023. CapEx was $4.6 billion in the quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. We remain on track for our full year CapEx guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $20 billion, further strengthening our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to about 13%, while the growth ratio is now at 20%, at the low end of our target range. We returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The increase in distribution reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and renewed strength of our balance sheet. I'll conclude with a few key takeaways. As I mentioned earlier, we are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. Our strong performance reflects the sizable investments we've been making over the past several years and our focus on the fundamentals. Those 2 things put us in a great position to deliver increased production at a time when the world needs it most. We're continuing to increase production of low-cost barrels in Guyana and the Permian. We're doing all of this while maximizing output of our existing facilities, including a new daily production record set by PNG LNG in July. Our new Corpus Christi complex was cash and earnings positive in the first half of the year with the world-scale steam cracker demonstrating design capacity. Our U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity is poised to increase by about 250,000 barrels per day with the start-up of the Beaumont refinery expansion project in the first quarter of 2023. Two new LNG projects are also advancing. Coral LNG and Mozambique is set to deliver its first cargo in the second half of this year. Our Golden Pass LNG project, which will provide 18 million tons per year of new LNG supplies, remains on schedule to start up in 2024. Once completed, Golden Pass will increase LNG from the Gulf Coast by 20%. In addition, we continue to divest nonstrategic assets at an opportune point in the cycle. We delivered strong safety and reliability while controlling costs. These moves are improving our asset mix, lowering our breakevens and boosting our resiliency. Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to grow our portfolio of opportunities with the 4 newly announced carbon capture and storage opportunities in Australia, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands. I'm extremely proud of the work our people are doing. All of their efforts are consistent with our strategic priorities, which our shareholders are being rewarded for. Today, with an even stronger balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest and to drive shareholder returns throughout the cycles. Our focus on the fundamentals is unchanged. We continue to leverage our core capabilities to advance our strategic priorities and to make the investments needed in this long-cycle business. With our constancy of purpose and consistent approach, we will successfully address the dual challenge, providing energy and products modern societies need while lowering society's greenhouse gas emissions, leading industry in the energy transition. Thank you. Sure. Well, Neil, I think you're touching on what is a very challenging situation today. And that reflects, I think, the complexity associated with making a massive change to a system that's so critically important to people's lives. And so I think going forward and what we're seeing happening today is a, what I'd say, is a broader net being cast with respect to how we think about the transition and how that evolves. Making sure that we've got a diversified portfolio of energy and one -- and sources of energy that are not dependent on any one nation state, which is, I think, an important step that we're seeing being taken. I think there'll be a drive over time to make sure that they're leveraging the resources available to them. And I'll just make one example would be the potential that we see for fracking and unconventional gas in Germany. I think the industry has proven over the years that unconventional gas can be produced safely and you then have a secure source of supply and economically and reliable source of supply. And so I think there's an opportunity where certainly, Exxon Mobil could play a key role. We also have a fairly large refining footprint in Europe. We've been working hard to upgrade those facilities, make sure that we're driving their emissions footprints to zero and developing plans to do that. And within this current crisis, have really stepped up the efforts to reduce our consumption of natural gas. In fact, if you look at our refining circuit, we reduced the use of natural gas by 65%. And -- that's the equivalent gas use for about -- for powering about 2 million homes in Europe. And so there are some substantial steps that we can take with respect to optimizing our current operation. Longer term, we're opening up -- looking at projects to expand our LNG import facilities. And of course, we are bringing LNG projects online. We've got the Golden Pass project here in the U.S., which will allow us to export LNG from the U.S. into Europe. And so we've got Mozambique, and that's coming on the back end of this year. And of course, we've got work going on in PNG. And so bringing more LNG supplies to help offset some of the Russian gas going into Europe will be another really critical step forward and the diversification of supplies for Europe. Sure. Doug, it's good to hear you again. With respect to demand, you're right. If you go back in time, under more normal circumstances, we do see a seasonal decline in the second quarter with gas demand, and that's historically been in the numbers, and we tend to foreshadow that in the first quarter, typically. This year, obviously, circumstances in Europe are very different, and we actually foreshadowed the first quarter that we didn't expect to see the same kind of seasonal dip because of the shortages that we were seeing in Europe at the time. And so I think going forward, obviously, a big question mark will be how the whole landscape and supply picture shapes up in Europe. And also, obviously, a big factor in gas demand will be weather. And so I think I wouldn't take this quarter as the new norm. I think we've just got to stay attuned to how the landscape develops there, what supply looks like and then obviously keep an eye on the weather. With respect to your question on Groningen, it's -- the capacity is there. It's something that the Dutch government obviously has control of and evaluates the circumstances and make decisions in terms of the production that they request our joint venture there NAM to produce. And so that will be a function of how the Dutch government kind of weighs off the demand for gas versus the supplies and the role they want Groningen to play. But the capacity is there. Yes. Devin, I'll touch on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. With respect to Permian, the plan that we laid out some time ago, and we're currently executing is -- hasn't changed, and we had a very slight ramp-up as we head through the year, but nothing significantly different than what we have been doing. The plans that we have in place should deliver, and our current production is in line with that 25% growth versus last year, which, as you know, was on top of 25% growth the year before. And as we saw on the package, if you look at our tight oil production in the U.S. versus 2017, we expect to end 2022 at 3x the level of production. So I would say the strategy remains in place, the plans that we're actually getting remains in place. We're looking for opportunities within the construct that we define to extend and expand the activities. But frankly, given the tightness in the market, the availability of rigs, there's not a whole lot of opportunity to move there. And maybe I'll ask Kathy to cover the inflationary topic. Sure. Happy to do that, Stephen. Thanks for calling in. Yes, you say it's a volatile area. I think the thing that's really changed in the refining landscape, which has impacted -- we're seeing that impact across a lot of industries and parts of our business is the pandemic. If you go back since 2020 and as we've mentioned in our prepared presentation, 3 million barrels a day of refining capacity has come out of the circuit since the pandemic. And what has typically happened, which is 3x the rate of historical levels. And typically, historical levels have been offset by new builds coming in. And of course, a lot of those new builds got pushed out because of the pandemic and the lack of revenue in the extremely negative and poor refining margins. And so we've created this hole with a lot more capacity coming off-line without a whole lot of new capacity, typically out and developing in parts of the world in Asia and the Middle East. That capacity is not coming on. So we've got this gap, demand recovers, and we don't have the capacity to meet that, which has led to a record, record-high refining margins. So I think the solution there is with time for additional capacity to come on. We're pleased that we had justified a fairly large expansion in our Beaumont refinery. Essentially, based on transportation differentials that generated a reasonable return with potential upsides in times of tight markets, which obviously we're going to be seeing as we bring this refinery expansion on. It's the biggest expansion over a decade in the U.S. And it's one that takes advantage of the utilities and the units that we already have and the connection that we have with the Permian. So a very advantaged project coming onto the market at a really good time. Outside of that, I don't see a whole lot of additional expansions here in the U.S. And then as we mentioned in the presentation, over the next 2 years, probably 1 million barrels a day of capacity, including the 2 50 at our site coming on in the marketplace, which is still fairly short of the capacity that came off. And so our view is we're going to see what I say, the tighter supply and demand balance. One of the real question marks out there is what happens with demand. I would tell you, even at 2019 levels, the market is relatively tight. And so I expect a tighter market and maybe elevated margins versus what the historical norm is. But I would expect much lower than what we've experienced here in the second quarter. But -- and then with time, we'll see that capacity come back on out in Asia and the Middle East. And the world market is very efficient, and those barrels will flow to the demand centers and balance things off. And so I think this will be a few year price environment, and we'll get back to what I think is a more typical refining industry structure. Thank you, Jeanine. Well, you're right, we have seen really good progress in what's happening on Guyana. I think it illustrates one of the advantages of a consistency of approach and just moving from one development to the other. We started off with Liza 1 with a smaller concept to get started and recognize that we would build on that and extend on the design that we had. So we had a concept of design one, build many. Obviously, as our discoveries mature and we get a better understanding of the reservoir and the development opportunities there, we will adjust those designs. So I think it's a function of really the development plans that we put in place and the right project to most efficiently deliver -- to develop those resources, and that will change as we move around that block and with the different structures and resources. So I wouldn't say, I think stay tuned as our plans mature and we get a better line of sight to it. We'll give you updates and let you know how we see that coming. I think with Payara, we did bring that one forward and announced that recently given the progress we're making. And as we continue to progress the other ones, we'll update you and the rest of the market on how we see those things coming together. But I'm very encouraged and feel good about the progress we're making and hope to see continued advancement in bringing those projects forward faster. Sure. No, thanks for your question. I think it's very timely and relevant. What I would say is, and what we've been talking about is we're pleased with the broader recognition that a more comprehensive set of solutions are going to be needed to address the challenges of an energy transition. And so the discussion evolving from just wind and solar and EVs to carbon capture, storage and biofuels and hydrogen is really important. And the recognition globally and with governments, particularly our government, that those are important technologies that need to be developed. And importantly, the markets need to be catalyzed and early investments incentivized, we think, is a really important development. And so while we -- I'm not real familiar with what's in the legislation since it's just come out, I think it is encouraging to see the recognition and the desire to try to catalyze investments in this space because as we've said, we think they're going to be absolutely critical for society to achieve its longer-term ambitions and to make significant reductions commissions. And so it's a step in the right direction. Our portfolio, we're trying to develop a diversified approach. We've got many of the projects within the portfolio that reduce our own emissions and do it economically. The total returns at about 10% on that portfolio. And of course, Dan running low carbon solutions working hard to improve on that. And then we've got other large projects that where we anticipate incentives coming in either through the market or through policy that we started the planning and development on so that as that policy develops, we'll have a project radian moving into execution. Blue hydrogen is one where that will be beneficial if those incentives come to pass, given the concept that we have there.  So I'd say generally a step in the right direction. I would also tell you, moving beyond the U.S. and more broadly looking around the world, a much more significant and serious effort in terms of looking for opportunities in the carbon capture, hydrogen, ammonia space and the biofuel space. And I've been pleased at the interest for governments all around the world and partners all around the world to engage with Exxon Mobil and to leverage the capabilities that we can bring to the space to help develop large-scale projects that make significant reductions and emissions. So I'd say really positive vectors in this space, and we feel good about how we're positioned. You bet, Jason. I think the short answer is yes. It's incentivizing, I think, both of those. And I think that's appropriate to look where there's an opportunity to take advantage of what I'll call the natural endowments in terms of sun and wind to deploy those technologies and renewable technologies to generate power. But at the same time, I think there's a recognition that there are deficiencies in those technologies. And while they offer an important solution and are necessary, they're not sufficient. And so I think at the same time, a recognition that we need to do more, particularly with gas given its cleaner footprint.  And I think a recognition as it was just speaking with Sam about, that the challenge here is emissions. Not oil and gas itself, it's the combustion of oil and gas and the emissions associated with that. And so dealing with emissions through carbon capture and storage is another opportunity to address the problem at a much lower cost and in a much quicker time frame. And so my sense and the conversations I'm having with governments around the world is a recognition of this broader approach, a basket of technologies are going to be needed and emphasis should be put on all the ones for the right reasons at the right time and consciously and explicitly recognizing the deficiencies and making sure that we're mitigating those deficiencies. It was just in Europe and having a conversation with some of the government leaders there and clearly recognize the challenge associated with renewables, wind and solar and the intermittency issue and a recognition that gas and gas fired power gen will be an important backstop to address that. So I think there's a much more holistic approach being taken and a more thoughtful one. And I think that's encouraging. Yes. You bet, Raj. What I would say is on Groningen, there's significant capacity there. Obviously, there's a balance that has to be struck and I know the Dutch government is very focused on responsible production there as are we. And so I think it won't be a limit of the capacity. It will more be a limit as to what the government thinks is necessary to produce given the circumstances there. So I don't know that there's a -- I wouldn't think of it as a capacity limit with respect to the facilities that we have there, but more of what do we want to do to try to balance the risk and the rewards associated with production out of that field. On the expansion and going above design capacity, I would tell you, been very, very pleased and frankly, proud of the organization and the work they've done really across the entire portfolio. You mentioned Liza and PNG, which are both really good examples and the ones that we've highlighted. But I would tell you, almost all the new projects that we're bringing on, as we line those out and get them up and running, the teams get very quickly focused on debottlenecking and optimizing and taking it above production capacity. And so I think we've got a long history of that. I think the way we have organized our technology and engineering organization now where we can leverage the learnings and capabilities and competencies every part of the organization on to any one particular asset is a huge, huge competitive leverage. And in fact, that's part of the improvements that we're seeing. In fact, at PNG, we brought downstream -- historical downstream optimization technology into that upstream traditional upstream facility, and that's making a big difference seeing that across a number of different platforms. So I don't have a new number to give you in terms of how to think about these. I would just tell you that you should feel comfortable that the organization to push and strive for getting the most -- the kit that we build and the projects that we bring online. And we'll give you updates as we're moving through here on the organization, successful with that to let you know how we're doing and growing that production. 10% above. Yes. Well, I think, Roger, it's a complicated space you're asking about, but a good one. I do think if over time, policymakers focus on what I think the real challenge with the energy transition is, which is dealing with emissions and the broader door opens for, say, carbon capture and storage or hydrogen and specifically blue hydrogen that, that opens up the door for additional oil and gas and the receptiveness of oil and gas coming on the marketplace, which I think frankly, is important just given the costs associated with the transition. If you can find ways to use existing infrastructure and don't have to rewire your entire industrial processes and power generation systems, that's going to be a win for society as we bring down emissions. And so that may open the door. I think that will just -- time will tell. And if that does, obviously, the demand changes. And maybe that incentivizes more investment and get you back into the range that's shown on the chart. From our perspective, what will change our investment is finding these advantaged opportunities. I think our view has been and continues to be that we're going to look for the opportunities where we can leverage the capabilities and competitive advantage of the corporation and generate above-industry average returns. The portfolio we've been advancing does that. We've got others that we're working on potential opportunities in the pipeline that we think will do that. And so as we are successful at securing those opportunities or developing them, you'll see those come into the portfolio. And frankly, the size of that investment will be a function of kind of how big those -- or the number of those projects that we find that are advantaged are. So that's kind of the -- how I would summarize it. Well, I would say, Rog, you've got to put what we're doing today and what we've got plan going forward in the context of what we've been doing over the last 5 years. You will recall back in 2018, we talked about aggressively investing in these opportunities and doing it countercyclically. While others were pulling back, we were leaning in. And that meant that we spent -- and you will recall this, I got a lot of pressure on this and criticism is spending that money upfront out of the cycle, which I think is paying off today. I think that was the right strategy is not to ramp up spending in the heat of the moment or the heat of the market. And so that strategy is paying off. You've got to look across that type cycle and I would say, aggregate the investments that we've been making. My expectation is we'll see -- we'll continue to see cycles in this industry. We're going to continue to look for the opportunities, particularly in the down cycle to bring advantaged investments forward. And that's the way we're going to be thinking about and looking at it. Yes. So in terms of our organic opportunities in the Permian, it will -- we're not going to step outside of the strategy that we developed in terms of driving capital-efficient production in the Permian. You'll recall we've talked about the corridor approach that we're pursuing in the Delaware. The fact that we've pre-invested in facilities there. We've got a very aggressive technology program that we've been working on for some time now. That's being built and brought into our production and drilling there. And one of the reasons why we're seeing some of the advances and cost and efficiency is driven by a lot of that work we've been doing in the technology space. We've got more technology that we're looking to bring into that. And so that's helping the development and the productivity of that development. We don't want to get too far ahead of that. So there are a lot of parameters that we're keeping an eye on to make sure that we deliver on our commitments to produce there at very low cost, have very low breakevens and high cash flow. That's the way we're thinking about it. I think we are always looking for acquisition opportunities. That has been -- that's always on the radar. And as you know, the key secret or the key advantage there you got to find is assets that fit with your advantages that you can bring additional value and improve value through an acquisition. So absolutely, that remains on the radar. I think as we work these technologies, as we advance our processes and techniques, that opens up additional advantage, which we can then look at and apply to other potential opportunities. So that's kind of the formula that we have there, and we're keeping our eyes open. Sure, Manav. I'll take a crack at that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. I think certainly, the dialogue that I've heard externally in this space is it's a complex picture to try to dissect to understand. And of course, the debate are we in a recession on a recession, I think, is in part a factor of this complicated landscape that we're looking at. I would say within our industry, it's no less complicated when you think about a lot of the supply constraints, some logistics challenges that we're facing. So it's difficult to get a really clear read on what's driving variation demand quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month given some of those logistics challenges that we're seeing inventory withdrawals and builds. And so a complicated space. I think bottom line is I wouldn't tell you that we're seeing something that would say we are in a recession or a near recession. But I would also say that it's a complex picture, frankly. The demand destruction question that you asked, I wouldn't tie and what we have seen is, obviously, earlier this year as prices really spiked up there is a level of discretionary demand, and we saw some of that demand come off with very high prices. As prices have come back down again, you're seeing some of that recover. And so I would say that's just the normal price response that you see with respect to demand and not tied to, say, a more macroeconomic picture.  I don't know, Kathy, if you have anything to add? Sure. I'll start off on that and then see if Kathy wants to add anything. I would tell you, what we're seeing here in the second quarter and we made reference to is while the ethane advantage that we have in the U.S., North America still is an advantage versus the rest of the world as gas prices go up and crude prices moderate and more naphthas out there. That advantage weekends, and we saw that with respect to the margin. But still reasonably healthy demand and good demand growth year-on-year. China obviously is an important market. And so as we move in and out of lockdowns there, that will have an impact on our chemicals demand. And the automotive market is an important market. And with some of the challenges they've had there with chips and production issues that has had in the short-term impacts, and we'll have to see how those get resolved. My expectation is as that gets resolved in automotive production, that was to pick up, we'd see that again, recover within our portfolio. So that's kind of the landscape that we see today and really be a function of where does China end up going with respect to its response to COVID. Kathy, anything to add? Sure. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I think if you look at today's technology, it has applicability. It's economic for more concentrated streams of CO2. As you move down the seriatum of emissions, so to speak, and the CO2 concentration becomes more and more dilute, that existing technology becomes more and more expensive. And I think that's one of the key challenges. And so one of the areas that we're working with our technology organizations is developments in technology that allow more economic capture of more diluted CO2 streams. And so I would say that's one constraint that's going to require technical advances to make it more affordable going forward. But outside that, within the streams that have the necessary concentration to make existing technology work, key variables will be storage and access to storage. And access to storage that's geographically close, logistically close because another key point will be the transportation cost. And so kind of requires concentrated streams of CO2, good logistics systems and storage -- abundant storage that's close by. You put those things together, you've got an equation that you can make these projects work with relatively modest incentive schemes. And in fact, that's what you're seeing with the Houston Hub carbon capture projects that we've tabled a very large source of somewhat concentrated CO2 streams that's logistically close to a good storage in the Gulf of Mexico. So all those equations come together. That require additional incentives, but something that would be reasonably inexpensive compared to the cost societies currently bearing to remove CO2. And as you move around the world, the projects that we're looking at have similar constructs to make that -- those projects viable. And then obviously, the governments are looking at what kind of policy would be required to help support those projects. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. Joining me today are Darren Woods, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides and our prerecorded remarks were made available on our Investors section of our website earlier this morning along with our news release. In a minute, Darren will provide opening comments and reference a few slides from that presentation, then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. We expect to conclude the call by about 9:30 a.m. Central Time. Let me encourage you to read our cautionary statement, which is on Slide 2. Please note, we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Now I'll turn the call over to Darren Woods.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As we laid out at our most recent Investor Day, our goal is to sustainably grow shareholder value through the execution of our strategic priorities seen on this slide. As we think about recent events, our job has never been clearer or more important. The need to meet society's evolving needs reliably and affordably is what consumers and businesses across the globe are demanding and what we delivered this quarter. First, we continue to build our competitively advantaged production portfolio, bringing new barrels to market today, driven in part by the high-value investments, we continue to progress through the pandemic-driven downturn in prices. A prime example of the benefits of our continued investments is Guyana. This quarter saw the successful start of the Liza Phase 2. Production is ramping up ahead of schedule and is expected to reach capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day by the third quarter of this year. Combined with Liza Phase 1, we will bring our total production capacity in Guyana to more than 340,000 barrels per day. Our third project Payara is running ahead of schedule with start-up now likely by year-end 2023. Yellowtail, the fourth and largest project to date on the Stabroek Block, received government approval of our development plan, is on schedule to start up in 2025. Further adding to our portfolio, we have made 5 new discoveries this year that have increased the estimated recoverable resources to nearly 11 billion oil equivalent barrels. Turning to the U.S., we continue to grow production in the Permian Basin. In March, we produced about 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, on pace to deliver a 25% increase versus 2021. Looking forward, we're also growing our globally diverse portfolio of low-cost capital-efficient LNG developments. In Mozambique, the 3.4 million ton per year Coral South Floating LNG production vessel is being commissioned after arriving on site in January. Coral South is on budget with the first LNG cargo expected in the fourth quarter. In addition to investing in high-value opportunities in our existing businesses, we are also advancing opportunities in our Low Carbon Solutions business. During the quarter, we announced plans to build a large-scale hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. We anticipate the facility will have the capacity to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day. Combined with carbon capture, transport and storage of approximately 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, this facility will be a foundational investment in the development of a Houston CCS hub, which will have the potential to eliminate 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year and represents a meaningful step forward in advancing accretive low-carbon solutions. We also reached a final investment decision to expand another important carbon capturing storage project at our helium plant in Wyoming. In addition, we received the top certification of our management of methane emissions at our Poker Lake development in the Permian. We're the first company to achieve this certification for natural gas production associated with oil. At the end of the first quarter, we implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage the scale and integration of the corporation, improve the effectiveness of our operations and better serve our customers. We combined our Downstream and Chemical operations into a single Product Solutions Business. This new integrated business will be focused on developing high-value products, improving portfolio value and leading in sustainability. As a result of these changes, our company is now organized along 3 primary businesses: Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions. These 3 businesses are supported by corporate-wide organizations, including projects technology, engineering, operations, safety and sustainability. Before I cover our financial results, I want to provide a perspective on the market environment. In the first quarter, a tight supply/demand environment, primarily due to low investment levels during the pandemic contributed to rapid increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. Clearly, the events in Ukraine have added uncertainty to what was already a tight supply outlook. Brent rose by about $22 per barrel or 27% versus the fourth quarter. Today, natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges, driven by tight global market conditions and ongoing European supply concerns. The same tight supply to manufacturers have also pushed refining margins near the top of the range. Chemical margins in Asia have fallen sharply, with product prices lagging the steep increases in fees and energy cost. In our case, the U.S. ethane feed advantage provided a significant positive offset versus this global view. With that market environment as the backdrop, let me turn to our first quarter financials. Earnings totaled $8.8 billion, excluding an identified item, the after-tax charge associated with Sakhalin-1. As you know, we are discontinuing our Sakhalin-1 operations in Russia, which represented less than 2% of our total production last year, about 65,000 oil equivalent barrels per day and about 1% of our corporate operating earnings. As the operator, our priority continues to be the health and safety of our people and the protection of the environment. Of course, we remain in full compliance with all U.S. sanctions and are closely coordinating with the U.S. administration. Turning to structural savings. We continue to drive further efficiencies and now delivering more than $5 billion of annual savings versus 2019. CapEx totaled $4.9 billion for the quarter, in line with our full year guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $14.8 billion, maintaining our strong balance sheet. Our debt-to-capital ratio remains in the low end of our 20% to 25% target range while our net debt-to-capital ratio dropped to about 17%. We returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, of which about 2/3 was in the form of dividends and the remainder, share repurchases, consistent with our previous program. We said during our Corporate Plan Update in December that we expect to repurchase $10 billion of our shares. This morning, we announced an increase to the program, up to $30 billion in total through 2023. This move reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and the strength of our balance sheet. Before I leave you with a few key takeaways, let me share one other decision we made this month with respect to our workforce. Continually investing in our people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities and essential to achieving our long-term objectives. As part of that effort, we are tripling the number of employees eligible for stock grants by bringing in high-performing employees at earlier stages of their careers. Our goal is to increase our people's ownership in the company and importantly, in our financial and operating results. Secondly, in June, we will implement a 3% off-cycle compensation adjustment in the U.S. to maintain competitiveness. Our compensation and benefits programs are a key element of our total value proposition that enables us to continue to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. Let me leave you with a few key takeaways. We had a strong first quarter, and I'm proud of the organization's progress. The impact of weather on the Upstream volumes and derivatives and timing impacts in the Downstream obscured a strong underlying performance. We anticipate an absence of these impacts and strong refining margins will position us very well in the second quarter. We are making outstanding progress on our high-value growth developments in Guyana, the Permian and LNG. Our new Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is up and running ahead of schedule and generated positive earnings and cash flow in its first quarter of operations. We have strengthened the balance sheet and are creating value for shareholders through an attractive dividend and increased share repurchases. We are advancing hydrogen, biofuels and other low carbon solutions consistent with our intention to lead in the energy transition, leveraging our competitive advantages of scale, integration and technology. Finally, we are evolving our organization from a holding company to an operating company to better serve our customers' evolving needs and grow long-term shareholder value. Before we take your questions, I want to acknowledge the very real impact the high prices are having on families all around the world. You may recall that we anticipated this in 2020 with industry investment levels well below those required to offset depletion. That's why we work so hard to preserve our capital expenditures during the depths of the pandemic, ensure that additional production was available to meet the eventual recovery in demand. Today, that long-term focus is paying off with growing production of industry-advantaged supply. We are continuing to focus on the fundamentals through ongoing investment in advantaged projects and low emission initiatives to ensure that we can continue to meet the critical needs of people all around the world reliably and importantly, well into the future.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren. One last piece of housekeeping I wanted to mention is that ahead of the segment reporting change next quarter, we plan to provide you annual and quarterly information for the past 5 years using the new reporting segments to assist you with your modeling. We plan to post the new data on our website around mid-June. Also, please note that starting with this call, we ask our analysts to limit themselves to a single question, so that we can fit in questions from more people. However, you may remain on the line in case a clarification is needed.  And with that, operator, please provide the instructions and then open the phone lines for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.\nPhil Gresh : Good morning, Darren and Kathy. So I guess my question is a little bit of a 2-part question then. The buyback, $30 billion over 2 years. Previously, you talked about, I think, $10 billion mostly in 2022. So should we assume the $30 billion essentially ratable, $15 billion this year? And then if that's the case, it still seems like there's a lot of excess cash potentially building out at the strip prices. So how do you think about any excess cash, debt reduction, et cetera, given where the leverage is versus targets now?\nKathy Mikells : Great. Thanks very much. So look, we don't know exactly how long the strong market conditions that we're seeing today are going to persist. And we learned some pretty tough liquidity lessons during the pandemic. So our cash balance has been building a bit. You would see that it was $11 billion as we ended the quarter. So you should expect with the backdrop of the strong market conditions that even with the higher buyback program that we announced this morning, we would be building our cash in the near term potentially between $20 billion to $30 billion over time. And so that really addresses our need for flexibility in what's an incredibly uncertain environment and ensuring that we'll continue to appropriately invest in the business and sustain the share repurchase program that we talked about through 2023. In terms of just how to think about the pace of the program, it's up to $30 billion through the end of 2023. We obviously got $2.1 billion done in this quarter. You should think about us looking to get up to a ratable pace. And that roughly, we'd be looking to get $15 billion done a year, again, looking to sustain the program kind of more consistently over this 2-year period. So that's how I would think about kind of roughly where we see our cash balance and just looking to maintain a lot of flexibility in what's a pretty uncertain environment. And we did learn some real lessons during the pandemic. We used to try and hold our cash balance, call it, between $3 billion and $5 billion and run a lot of commercial paper. And when the pandemic hit, that was quite problematic for the company. So we're going to be a little bit more conservative here in the near term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai : Our question is related broadly to your global gas opportunities. Can you talk about how you see the evolution of the U.S. market? And how do you see certified gas playing a role in U.S. supply? And I guess, do you intend to really look for a global outlet for a portion of your U.S. gas? And we understand that Golden Pass provides a great opportunity to capture the spread, but maybe are you thinking about some other opportunities besides Golden Pass?\nDarren Woods : You're welcome, Jeanine. Good to hear from you again. Just maybe a broad comment on the LNG business. Obviously, as we're seeing across each of our sectors, the pandemic had a pretty profound effect with respect to deferring, delaying capital spend and, therefore, additional capacity coming on. And as the pandemic has subsided and demand has recovered, we're seeing very tight markets and seeing that play out really around the world, obviously, a significant impact. And then with the Ukraine and the situation there that has added a significant additional level of uncertainty around supply. And so I think a very dynamic market and a very high-priced market. And what we've seen in response to that is basically very full capacity utilization all around the world, maximizing the amount of LNG moving. Obviously, we've got our Coral LNG starting up later this year, which will help contribute and ease some of that tightness. And then you mentioned Golden Pass, which is an important leg of our strategy of making sure that we have access to LNG supplies that we can -- to supply demand all around the world, and that's a very important part of our strategy in LNG going forward is making sure that we've got barrels that we can then move and trade in the marketplace and move across the different regional demand centers. And so I think we're going to continue to look for opportunities in LNG. It's an important part of the portfolio. We've got opportunities in PNG that we're progressing obviously, additional investments on Mozambique are in the future as well. And so I think it will be a very important foundational layer of supply and a really important part of our overall business offering\nKathy Mikells : And I would just add, you asked a little bit about that top rating that we got on methane management in Poker Lake in the Permian. And we would say we really see a market over time building for lower emission products, and that really plays into that. And we would certainly hope that we'd also start to see a premium on those lower emission products, right? And we'd say that's consistent across our business, but we definitely are looking to play into that going forward.\nDarren Woods : Yes. I would just add to that. Obviously, that would be a benefit, but it's certainly not the main driver with respect to making sure that our operations have very low emissions and very low methane emissions. And so that's a core part of our commitment in running these facilities. And to the extent the market pays a premium for that, that's an advantage that we'll look to take the advantage of.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott : I wanted to ask about the structural cost reduction goals. You continue to make good progress there. But the question is, can you add a little bit of color around what you're seeing on just broad cost inflation, labor and otherwise? And how, if at all, that impacts some of those goals and targets over time?\nKathy Mikells : Sure. So I'll start out with just saying, we feel good about the progress that we're continuing to make. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had said we've gotten to about $5 billion in structural cost savings relative to 2019. We're now at $5.4 billion. So I'd say, overall, we feel really good about that progress. Obviously, we have now put in place the new organizational structure, which should drive incremental efficiencies on top of just driving better operations, faster speed to market, better deployment, faster deployment of resources to the highest opportunities across the company. We're not immune to inflation, obviously, and we would see a fair amount of both energy and feedstock inflation coming through the business in certain areas that put a little bit of pressure on margins. Overall, in terms of how we're managing that, it flows through 2 parts of the operation. So one is on CapEx. We feel really good about where we're at there because during the pandemic, we really took the opportunity to extend contracts on work that was coming forward. So I'd say while the shorter cycle work programs obviously have some inflationary pressure, the teams are working really hard to offset that. Overall, I'd say we really try and lever master service agreement, self-manage kind of procurement. We utilize a diverse set of global contractors across the globe in trying to really manage inflation. So through the quarter right now, I'd say we're doing a pretty good job of offsetting it, but it's obviously something that we're watching really closely.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would just emphasize the point that Kathy made, but I think one worth remembering, that this longer-term view that we took during the pandemic in trying to maintain a lot of investment, we also recognize that as economies recovered and demand picked up that we would potentially see inflation. And so we were very focused on -- in anticipation of that, trying to lock in some of the pricing and savings during all points that we could then take advantage of early on a recovery, which is considerably. And maybe the final point I would make is with the new organization, it's working hard and our leadership team is working hard to offset inflation and out of that, we think we've got a pretty good handle here, certainly in the short term. Obviously, we'll see how the market develops.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : I have -- a question we wanted to focus on was around Downstream. And Darren, you know the refining business really well given your leadership role there over the years. So I'd love you to kind of characterize how you're seeing the crack and refining market environment which is obviously extraordinarily strong. And then put that in the context of the quarter, which was softer in Downstream. But to your point, I think a lot of that was timing effects. And it feels like things should sequentially move in the right direction as you move into 2Q. So the big picture question around the refining macro, and then tie it into how you're thinking about the sequential move in your earnings power from here.\nDarren Woods : Sure. Neil, yes, I can start, and I feel like we're going to be a little bit of a broken record with respect to the anchoring a lot of what we're seeing in the market today across our sectors with the pandemic. And you'll recall, as we were going through that very deep down cycle, where demand for fuels products dropped significantly, there was a lot of refinery rationalization. In fact, the refineries were shutting down at a much, much higher rate than historical averages or tons, if not higher. And so you had a lot of capacity coming out of the marketplace. There were new facilities that were planned or in progress primarily in the Middle East and out in Asia. Those got deferred and delayed because of the occurrence. And so you've got, I think this period of time where you've taken a lot of capacity out and new capacity that was planned or in progress has been deferred and delayed. And so we've got a period with lower supply. And then, of course, this demand has picked up, that has led to this very tight market and the higher margins that we're seeing. What's compounded that then is the important role that Russia plays in supplying markets around the world. And with the uncertainty associated with that supply and potential impacts of additional sanctions that's put, I think, additional concern and anxiety in the marketplace, which is leading to a very high margin environment. One, frankly, that I don't think is a sustainable one; and two, good for economies around the world. So I think we're in a bit of a very tight time frame. And as you've talked about the first quarter, obviously, we saw that evolve over the first quarter with kind of rising margins in January, February, March and now into April, very high margins. And so I think that's something that we're going to see for quite some time, certainly here this year and into next, depending on obviously work how demand plays out. Final point I make, which you touched on is, you're right, this quarter reflects that ramp-up of margins. So you're not really seeing the healthy market that we're experiencing right now in the first quarter results, that will, I think, manifest itself in the second quarter. And then some of the timing impacts we expect to see unwind. Maybe I'll let Kathy just touch on those.\nKathy Mikells : Sure. I'm happy to do that. And just to add a stat, our March refining margin was about $4 higher than the average in the quarter. So that's kind of reflecting that ramp-up that Darren just mentioned. And then obviously, in our prepared script, you would have seen us talk a fair amount to timing impacts that impacted profitability in Downstream for the quarter. I think everybody understands the mark-to-market on open derivatives, so I won't talk about that. But we had another $590 million of other timing differences. About $400 million of that was also tied to derivatives. We had $200 million that associated with cargoes where the derivatives actually closed in March, and then they reversed when the physical deliveries occurred in April. So I'd say the way you should think about that is we took a $200 million bad guy in March, and we will see a $200 million good guy in April. We also had $200 million associated with settled derivatives that we just used to ensure pricing of our refinery crude runs is ratable, right? The way you should think about that is it's kind of a wash over time. Sometimes, that pricing mechanism gives us a positive in a quarter, sometimes it gives us a negative in a quarter. Over time, it's just a wash. And then the last impact that we talked about was just commercial pricing lag, right? And the way I would think about that is we were in a steep rising price environment over the quarter. And so we had pricing that was a little bit lagging. If we're in a stable environment, that pricing will catch up. If pricing kind of turns to a downward curve, then we'd actually get a little bit of a benefit. So that's how I think about it as you're trying to model the evolution into the second quarter here. The bottom line is, obviously, we're carrying a lot of positive momentum as we stand here today.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Let me first of all thank the Investor Relations team for the better presentation of results. So thanks for that Jennifer. But I'm also -- we're losing a question here, so I'll tend for the enthusiasm, but I'm kidding. Thank you.  So guys, my question, Darren and Kathy, is on your balance sheet. Darren, going back some years, I guess, a couple of years ago, you talked about don't expect Exxon to go back to the days of zero net debt. We're going to have a more efficient balance sheet. I just wonder if you can frame that for us today and what we should expect that to look like because, obviously, that speaks to go forward cash distributions, buybacks, cash on hand, the whole thing and obviously, dividend policy. So that was my question for today.\nDarren Woods : Yes. Thank you, Doug, and I appreciate your compliments to the IR team. I know they've been working hard to make sure that they're improving the transparency and information that you need to help understand what we're doing here and the business results that we're achieving. I think to your point on the balance sheet, and you remember what we started back in 2018 was this countercyclical approach where we lean on the balance sheet during the depths, made those investments with an eye on the fundamentals and expected recoveries and to take advantage of the ups with investments and facilities in the ground and then reinvest and lean into the down cycle. And I would tell you, generally speaking, that continues to be an ambition of ours and part of our strategy is to try to drive the countercyclical investment approach, which is -- has worked out very well for us and is paying off in today's market. But that's, I would say, 1 philosophy. Obviously, it is tempered by just the availability of cash and how deep and high the swings in this commodity cycle are. And so I think part of that balance sheet, and I want to toss it to Kathy here in a minute, let her make some comments on it, but part of that is just going to be a function of where you're at in the cycle and how severe that cycle is. And so there will be periods, I think, where you see some movement in both cash and how the balance sheet is structured. And based on where we're at and where the revenues are, and I would also tell you, though, that it's not what's not going to change is being very focused on making sure that any investment that we make is advantaged across the cycle. You'll recall my definition of disciplined investing is not an absolute level, but more of making sure that anywhere you spend money that you're convinced that you'll be the low-cost supplier with an advantage versus the rest of the industry, that will be successful as you move through the cycle. Kathy?\nKathy Mikells : Yes. And then the only thing that I would add to that Doug is occasionally, I get the question of why don't you just go and kind of pay off all of the debt you have as a priority. And I'd say, we're really comfortable with the level of debt that we have. And obviously, our gross debt-to-cap is at the lower end of the range that we talked about. And we said we're going to carry a little bit of a higher cash balance just reflective of the volatility that we've really seen in the market. So that's how I think you should think about it. But we're very comfortable with our level of debt and just being able to kind of manage at that level through the cycle.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Richardson : Another question on the Downstream, if I could, Darren. I wonder if I could ask on the circular polymer efforts and some of the things you're talking about in terms of recycling in the plastics business. There's, I guess, the question is the overall approach between mechanical and molecular recycling and how are you seeing that market evolve? And is this conversion of existing facilities or new reactors? And then also, what are your expectations for the returns in that business kind of through cycle?\nDarren Woods : Sure. Yes. Thank you, Stephen. I think you touched on, I think, a really important part of our strategy as we look at going forward, not only in the plastics and plastics recycling, but also in biofuels. And I think what people have thought about with respect to our refining footprint and the size of that footprint that as fuels, traditional fuels demand declines, if those assets become disadvantaged. And frankly, given the integration that we have with those facilities, if you think about our chemicals and refining facilities integrated, which are now reflected in our Product Solutions business, the fact that we've got base stocks and lubricant facilities integrated with those, they are fairly robust platforms with large scale and low cost. And what we see is the opportunity that as demand shifts to convert those facilities to produce more lower emissions fuels for biofuels and to utilize existing equipment for advanced recycling in plastics. And that's what you've seen us do in Baytown with conversion of some of our heavy cracking facilities on the refining side used to recycle waste plastic. And we've got pretty ambitious plans in that space. We like what we see there. It gives products that have all the same attributes as virgin products, but obviously, without the same -- with the ability to recycle the waste. And so we like the molecular recycling, that's where we're focusing. We think we can bring an advantage there with; one, our facilities; but two, our technology; and then three, with our marketing organization with respect to the marketing of those products.  So feel generally good about that. We've got plans to drive that recent advanced recycling to 500,000 metric tons by 2026, should have 30,000 metric tons in place by the end of this year. So I think, in total, we like what we see there. The market today is interested in those products and there is a premium out there. So right now, I think that looks pretty attractive. I suspect with time that may -- the market will stabilize, but we think it's going to be a pretty helpful market for some time to come.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jason Gabelman with Cowen\nJason Gabelman : I wanted to ask a question about your international gas footprint and the maintenance cadence because it seems like you've mentioned in the slides that gas production is going to be higher than it typically is in 2Q and 3Q, but you do have higher scheduled maintenance. So I'm wondering if any of that maintenance is in the European gas footprint. And then more broadly, if you're seeing in the industry in Europe more tempered declines from European gas into the summer, just given where prices are? And if you expect that to be a feature of the market moving forward?\nDarren Woods : I think you've touched on the point that we made in our second quarter outlook with respect to the seasonality, which historically, we've seen going into the second quarter a significant drop in demand for gas. And given where the markets are at today and the level of inventories around the world, our expectation is we're not going to see the same level of demand change quarter-on-quarter, and we try to indicate that in our outlook to suggest that we will see the same level of seasonality going forward. I think, and as I said earlier with response to Jeanine's question, we do see this market being fairly tight here in the short term. Obviously, the industry is working hard to supply that, but it will -- the time cycle on investments and bringing additional supply on is fairly long, particularly in the context of where demand is at today and the tightness in the marketplace. So I think that's going to continue to be with us for a while. And as you move, as demand declines, I think we'll see supply start to move into inventory. And so that purchases will move from meeting current demand out in the marketplace to meeting the demand to fill inventory to make sure that inventories are well positioned as we move through the summer and then back into the fall and into the winter season that the markets are well supplied. And then the final point I would make there is obviously, with what's happening in Ukraine, there is a wildcard there that I think most economies and governments around the world are going to make sure that they're trying to mitigate the potential implications of that supply disruption by having good inventory levels.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: A question on -- actually, just a longer-term sort of capital allocation question in the context of what's become kind of conventional wisdom that NOCs around the world are very interested in accelerating activity here and bringing new resource to market. But the majority of NOCs, with the exception of a few, rely on foreign investment and partners like ExxonMobil in the industry, on the independent operator side has framed a stable spending view over the long term, which has been something that's been very helpful for investors to have that multiyear CapEx range. So I'm just wondering your perspective on how that squares if the industry is going to get pulled into the imperative of NOCs to spend more and do more or if you think these steady ranges of CapEx are achievable even within that context?\nKathy Mikells : Sure. I'm happy to take that, Sam. So first of all, I would just remind you that we do have CapEx guidance that's out there, obviously, for this year, it's'21 to 24. And we've talked about kind of through 2027 range of 20 to 25. Now within that, we always try to leave ourselves a little bit of room understanding that there's these opportunities that can come up in the future. And obviously, we've made some investments in the type of opportunities that you're talking about in the past. And by the way, Golden Pass is a JV that we have with foreign investment that sits behind it as well. So I'd say we don't feel any particular pressure. I just reference back to what Darren said earlier, which is, we spend capital when we have confidence behind the projects and the returns that those projects are going to offer, right? And we're, I'd say, very, very disciplined at pressure testing those projects to make sure they're resilience across the, I'd say, wide set of market environment, given the cyclicality that we have in the business. So we feel great about the opportunities that stand in front of us right now. Obviously, we've got a low cost of supply barrels that we're investing in, be it Guyana or the Permian, Brazil. Darren mentioned the LNG projects that we're moving forward, which we feel really good about. Obviously, we've got in a Product Solution space, investments that we continue to make to support growth in high-value products, right, and to keep, I'd say, optimizing our Downstream circuit. So we feel good about that. If there's opportunities where we feel like there's a good return to be earned, we'll certainly look at potentially participating in those opportunities. But we're going to be very disciplined in our approach as you should expect from us.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And I would just add to that, Sam, if you look at the work we've been doing with our organization, the changes that we've made in the structure, the consolidation of capabilities across the corporation. One of the changes we announced on April 1 was a technology organization that combines the technical skills and capabilities and the engineering capabilities across the corporation. We've seen really good results doing that in the projects area. We think we've got a real opportunity in the technology area to realize similar benefits in terms of effectiveness on top of whatever efficiencies that might come from that work. And I would say that effectiveness in that concentration of technology and really getting the organization to focus on where we can add unique value and grow competitive advantage is going to be a really important part of continuing to be a valued partner with NOCs and others all around the world. Now our strategy here is to make sure that we're in a central partner that when NOCs and other resource holders are -- or want somebody who can effectively and efficiently develop the resource and doing in a sustainable manner that the first name to come to mind is ExxonMobil and then we bring those unique capabilities. And I would tell you, I have enormous confidence that that's what's going to happen. Things that we can see in the pipeline, the opportunities that we have in front of us to become more effective at what we do I think are huge and we're looking forward to then leveraging that business opportunities in the future.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria : I had a question on Guyana. The fourth FPSO, which you just sanctioned was lodged on 250,000 barrels a day. I'm just wondering, in your base case plans, are you assuming a similar size for the later FPSOs at that rate? And if I could add a second question. A few days ago, there was an announcement from the DOE around additional export capacity from Golden Pass. I was wondering if you could just help me understand whether that was just an administrative thing, whether that was you sort of relooking at the project? Or is it some kind of future pricing ahead of debottlenecking there?\nDarren Woods : Yes, sure. On Guyana, Biraj, I would tell you that, as you know, we are having tremendous success with respect to discoveries there and the characterization of that resource. And I would just say that our teams have been very focused on making sure we have a good characterization of that resource, which will then be a really important part of how we choose to develop that resource in a cost-effective way to make sure that the cost of supply and obviously, the returns for those projects lead industry. And so as we look at that, these bigger production facilities make a lot of sense when you have the resource to support and because it brings your unit cost down, brings down your cost of supply. As we look at extending those developments in other areas of the resource base, it will be a function of what we find, but I would say we would lean towards these larger developments, and we'll obviously lean towards extending some of the current developments that we have and taking advantage of whatever synergies we might have with those facilities. And so I wouldn't say there's a single recipe here. It's really tailoring the recipe to make sure that it's optimized for the development opportunities that we've got in front of us. And that's going to evolve as we better characterize the resource base. And I will just say, with respect to Golden Pass, that project and the work that we're doing there, we feel good about the progress that we're making, and we're on schedule. The concept there is not changing.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read : Maybe to come back a little bit to the Guyana question, and I was -- wanted to clarify 1 thing there. And then maybe just sort of a contrast to your Permian operations given Permian production is higher today, but Guyana resource is probably larger. As we think about the 11 billion barrels of resource, is that -- should we assume that's exclusively oil at this point? I mean that's been kind of our baseline given the type of production coming out. And then how should we think about the long-term gas situation there, the opportunity? And when I said versus the Permian, kind of thinking about those 2 as we look to the middle and latter part of the decade.\nDarren Woods : Yes. Good morning, Roger. I would say the resource is a mix and depending on where you're at within the Stabroek Block, that mix changes. Our development priorities is weighted towards liquid. So I think what you'll see in our plans and the way we talk about it is there's a bias towards liquid today. And then with time, we'll see how those developments evolve. We're doing some things with the government of Guyana to bring gas onshore to help deliver more cost efficient and environmentally better. Power to the people of Guyana and give them a much lower cost energy source and a much cleaner energy source. And so there is some development gas in that space. So -- but I would say, generally, liquids weighted in obviously, as we move through the field and run the economics, we'll develop the resources that optimize capital and grow returns.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd : Maybe one on capital allocation. As we think about your capital budget, it's not just for this year but over the next few years and the range that you have within those budgets, is that -- should we think about that range is primarily driven by timing? Or should we -- is there a possibility that higher commodity prices -- should we think about maybe pushing towards the higher end of the range through some combination of inflation? Or are there opportunities in the portfolio to deploy a little additional organic capital, whether it's on short or mid-cycle infill drilling, tieback opportunities. Does the higher commodity price open up the door to a little extra capital deployment opportunity there?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I'll just start off, and then pass it to Kathy for any additional comments, but I would -- I think the short answer is no. I think we have tried to emphasize looking through the cycles, looking at the long term and making sure that the investments that we make are robust to the whole of the cycle. You remember, we were investing pretty heavily when prices were down in anticipation of longer-term fundamentals. I would say while we're in a very tight market today, we're not going to let that distract us from our focus of making sure that we have low cost of supply, industry-leading advantaged projects. And so that remains the focus. In the short-cycle stuff, I think to the extent that we stay within our credibly advantaged approach and the manufacturing processes that we've set in and the boundaries that we set with respect to the facilities that we've built, we pre-invested in and we'll continue to optimize around that, but we're not going to go outside of that broader strategy of the long ball game that we're playing in the Permian, in the interventional space.\nKathy Mikells : Yes. And I would say, certainly, timing over what's a relatively long-term period is something that we're trying to give a little flexibility for. I'd actually point to what we talked about on the Payara Guyana project. Originally, we said that was going to start up in 2024, and now we're saying we think it's likely it will start up at the end of 2023. So that would be an example of, we have initial planning that we do, but obviously, accelerating projects if we can bring them in, in a shorter time frame. And obviously, on or under budget is something we're always focused on.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : First, hopefully, that also won't use my quota, yet I want to complement IR for the new format on the call as well as the increased disclosure, really appreciate. I have to apologize first because I want to go back into the inflation question. Kathy, on -- if we're looking out for your next several years, do you have a number you can share what percent of your CapEx is pretty much that had some pretty fixed pricing? And what percent is going to be subject to the inflation factor? And also in your presentation, you talked about the 3% off-cycle compensation adjustment. Could you quantify that how big is that number for us?\nKathy Mikells : Sure. So overall, I think we talked a little bit about inflation on CapEx and the fact that certainly in the near term, we're feeling pretty good because we did a lot of work during the pandemic. So we had caused some projects. And during the pandemic, we did a lot of work to actually put the contracts in place like finish the engineering and put the contracts in place at a point where I'd say there was some deflationary pressures in the market. So as it relates to our overall capital projects, we feel pretty good over the next couple of years. And obviously, strategically, the timing of when we do the engineering, when we go out to procurement, is something that we're always looking at and taking into consideration. And then I mentioned the fact that doing our own procurement globally to make sure that we're getting globally competitive bids is something else we do. We do spend a lot of money over the years as we're looking forward on the boats associated with Guyana development. And again, we approach that in a really strategic manner, so that we're managing those projects to the lowest cost, getting the specific design that we need. So that's how I would really discuss what's happening with regard to inflation.\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would just add that the action that we announced this morning we're taking won't be material in the analysis that you're doing, Paul. Our intention would be to continue to deliver on the efficiency, I mean that's a -- that we had projected in our plan.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.\nManav Gupta : My very quick question here is, at the start of the call, you indicated that Asian Chemical margins are kind of below mid-cycle. And I just want to understand, generally, when crude moves up, there is support for commodity prices. So there's 2 equations going on here, some capacity coming on, but crude is also moving up. So do you expect the margins to remain below mid-cycle for some time? Or do you think that higher crude could actually push up the ethylene margins and stuff in the non-U.S. region on a go-forward basis?\nDarren Woods : Sure. Yes. I think it's an unusual time we've got in the chemical market just because we see a level of dislocation between what's happening in Asia and what we see happening in the Atlantic Basin. I think we made reference in the comments that our North America footprint in Chemical and the ethane advantage that we have has actually helped mitigate this broader downturn that we're seeing with the global chemical markets, which are heavily weighted to -- or weighted towards the downturn that we're seeing in Asia. And I think as you look at crude prices coming up and the marginal supply in olefins being a liquid cracker and naphtha feed that as that crude price goes up here, feed goes up and naphtha feed goes up. And so you've got cost increases on your feed. And because of some of the logistics constraints and the ability to kind of connect the market's demand is somewhat dislocated and so you've got oversupply in a market like China where you see some of the demand coming off lockdown and the logistics constraints. So I think you've got -- we're in a unique period right now where you're seeing some regional imbalances and inability to close those imbalances through logistics and transportation. We'll see how long it's going to last. But I think ultimately, as markets open up, we'll see those equilibrate with -- again, I think if crude remains high, my suspicion is that ethane and ethane cracking will continue to be advantaged. And then that will obviously move as crude prices move with respect to gas prices.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Herrmann with Exane.\nLucas Herrmann : I just wanted to return to Golden Pass, if I might, and a couple of aspects of the question. The first is just can you expand on the marketing approach? How you intend placing volume? It's a very large project but it's a project which, to the best of my knowledge, has very little by way of contract at this time. So to what extent yourself and your partner QP will -- how you'll be looking to market products? And just can you give us some indication on the phasing of the start-up of the 3 trains? I presume when you talk about 2024 startup, that's the first train. I guess I'd expect 4 to 6 months-or-so between the start-up of each subsequent train, but any guidance you can give there would be helpful.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Lucas, just to start on the back end of your question, you're right, train 1 is -- we expect to start up in 2024 and then the remaining trains in 2025. And what -- the strategic drive behind that investment and that supply point was really getting a global -- a balanced global footprint with respect to LNG supply. So that Golden Pass facility gives us an anchor point within the Americas to take advantage of the U.S. gas market and the developments that we've seen there and the supply potential that we see in U.S. gas. And so that forms a really important anchor supply point. And we intend to use that with the trading business that we're growing in LNG and use it as an ability to trade and oftentimes bridge as some of our other LNG projects are being developed to bridge and supply between those projects that allow us to optimize and make commitments for projects with flexibility in terms of using Golden Pass as a supply point and then to also just trade in the spot market. So I think it's going to give us a lot of flexibility to supplement our longer-term contracts for our bigger projects, but to also participate in the spot market.\nLucas Herrmann: So there's no intent to contract some of the volume in what could be a very constructive market for pricing over the next 2, 3 years for those who have supply coming on this near term?\nDarren Woods: I would tell you that the LNG organization is going to basically develop that portfolio in the way that they think maximizes the value of it. So I wouldn't take anything off the table. I'm just -- I'm suggesting that it's -- we've got a lot of optionality and flexibility and the expectation is the LNG business and the individual running that take advantage of that flexibility to maximize the value, that's how I would characterize it.\nOperator: And it looks like we have time for 1 more question, so we'll take that from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Thank you for squeezing me in and my question is on the Permian. Just wondering, I'm trying to assume you all running somewhere around 16 rigs and 5 spreads. I'm just wondering, will this continue to be around the level of activity needed in order to achieve that, I think, your goal around that 25% year-over-year Permian growth plans? And I was just also wondering if you could talk about maybe just broadly, the degree of inflation you just currently seeing there?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would tell you that the plan that we had, and we've talked about with respect to the Permian, specifically somewhere between 10 and 12 rigs and then frac crew, something like that. And we're basically, I think, in line with that plan right now. And part of that is making sure that we're -- the developments that we're pursuing are consistent with the base infrastructure, the technology and the capital efficiency approaches that we've built into that development that tends to drive what we're doing there. I think what -- and Kathy has touched on, we, again, had anticipated the market recovery and some of the tightness and so had developed some contracting strategies and partnering with suppliers to try to mitigate that impact. That's paying off. We're seeing that advantage here in the Permian. Eventually, that obviously will roll off. Some of the consumables and some of the labor tight -- tightness that we're seeing in the Permian, obviously, that's starting to impact us as well. So we are seeing inflationary pressures. The expectation is that will continue to grow as the work activity opens up and as some of the logistics constraints get resolved. And we're basically -- we've challenged the team to try to manage that and to make sure that as we look at progressing development and grow that production that we're doing it in a constructive way and not undermining the cost of supply or the advantaged position of those barrels where they sit in the supply -- cost of supply curve for the industry. So I think we're going to -- this disciplined approach that we've talked about is not so much a spend, but in terms of efficiency and making sure that everything -- that every dollar we spend there is productive. And the challenge for that team is to make sure we don't lose productivity of the capital that we're spending.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thanks, Darren, and thanks, everybody, for your time and for your questions this morning. We appreciate that. We will post a transcript of the call on our investor website early next week. Have a great weekend. Thanks.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As we laid out at our most recent Investor Day, our goal is to sustainably grow shareholder value through the execution of our strategic priorities seen on this slide. As we think about recent events, our job has never been clearer or more important. The need to meet society's evolving needs reliably and affordably is what consumers and businesses across the globe are demanding and what we delivered this quarter. First, we continue to build our competitively advantaged production portfolio, bringing new barrels to market today, driven in part by the high-value investments, we continue to progress through the pandemic-driven downturn in prices. A prime example of the benefits of our continued investments is Guyana. This quarter saw the successful start of the Liza Phase 2. Production is ramping up ahead of schedule and is expected to reach capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day by the third quarter of this year. Combined with Liza Phase 1, we will bring our total production capacity in Guyana to more than 340,000 barrels per day. Our third project Payara is running ahead of schedule with start-up now likely by year-end 2023. Yellowtail, the fourth and largest project to date on the Stabroek Block, received government approval of our development plan, is on schedule to start up in 2025. Further adding to our portfolio, we have made 5 new discoveries this year that have increased the estimated recoverable resources to nearly 11 billion oil equivalent barrels. Turning to the U.S., we continue to grow production in the Permian Basin. In March, we produced about 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, on pace to deliver a 25% increase versus 2021. Looking forward, we're also growing our globally diverse portfolio of low-cost capital-efficient LNG developments. In Mozambique, the 3.4 million ton per year Coral South Floating LNG production vessel is being commissioned after arriving on site in January. Coral South is on budget with the first LNG cargo expected in the fourth quarter. In addition to investing in high-value opportunities in our existing businesses, we are also advancing opportunities in our Low Carbon Solutions business. During the quarter, we announced plans to build a large-scale hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. We anticipate the facility will have the capacity to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day. Combined with carbon capture, transport and storage of approximately 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, this facility will be a foundational investment in the development of a Houston CCS hub, which will have the potential to eliminate 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year and represents a meaningful step forward in advancing accretive low-carbon solutions. We also reached a final investment decision to expand another important carbon capturing storage project at our helium plant in Wyoming. In addition, we received the top certification of our management of methane emissions at our Poker Lake development in the Permian. We're the first company to achieve this certification for natural gas production associated with oil. At the end of the first quarter, we implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage the scale and integration of the corporation, improve the effectiveness of our operations and better serve our customers. We combined our Downstream and Chemical operations into a single Product Solutions Business. This new integrated business will be focused on developing high-value products, improving portfolio value and leading in sustainability. As a result of these changes, our company is now organized along 3 primary businesses: Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions. These 3 businesses are supported by corporate-wide organizations, including projects technology, engineering, operations, safety and sustainability. Before I cover our financial results, I want to provide a perspective on the market environment. In the first quarter, a tight supply/demand environment, primarily due to low investment levels during the pandemic contributed to rapid increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. Clearly, the events in Ukraine have added uncertainty to what was already a tight supply outlook. Brent rose by about $22 per barrel or 27% versus the fourth quarter. Today, natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges, driven by tight global market conditions and ongoing European supply concerns. The same tight supply to manufacturers have also pushed refining margins near the top of the range. Chemical margins in Asia have fallen sharply, with product prices lagging the steep increases in fees and energy cost. In our case, the U.S. ethane feed advantage provided a significant positive offset versus this global view. With that market environment as the backdrop, let me turn to our first quarter financials. Earnings totaled $8.8 billion, excluding an identified item, the after-tax charge associated with Sakhalin-1. As you know, we are discontinuing our Sakhalin-1 operations in Russia, which represented less than 2% of our total production last year, about 65,000 oil equivalent barrels per day and about 1% of our corporate operating earnings. As the operator, our priority continues to be the health and safety of our people and the protection of the environment. Of course, we remain in full compliance with all U.S. sanctions and are closely coordinating with the U.S. administration. Turning to structural savings. We continue to drive further efficiencies and now delivering more than $5 billion of annual savings versus 2019. CapEx totaled $4.9 billion for the quarter, in line with our full year guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $14.8 billion, maintaining our strong balance sheet. Our debt-to-capital ratio remains in the low end of our 20% to 25% target range while our net debt-to-capital ratio dropped to about 17%. We returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, of which about 2/3 was in the form of dividends and the remainder, share repurchases, consistent with our previous program. We said during our Corporate Plan Update in December that we expect to repurchase $10 billion of our shares. This morning, we announced an increase to the program, up to $30 billion in total through 2023. This move reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and the strength of our balance sheet. Before I leave you with a few key takeaways, let me share one other decision we made this month with respect to our workforce. Continually investing in our people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities and essential to achieving our long-term objectives. As part of that effort, we are tripling the number of employees eligible for stock grants by bringing in high-performing employees at earlier stages of their careers. Our goal is to increase our people's ownership in the company and importantly, in our financial and operating results. Secondly, in June, we will implement a 3% off-cycle compensation adjustment in the U.S. to maintain competitiveness. Our compensation and benefits programs are a key element of our total value proposition that enables us to continue to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. Let me leave you with a few key takeaways. We had a strong first quarter, and I'm proud of the organization's progress. The impact of weather on the Upstream volumes and derivatives and timing impacts in the Downstream obscured a strong underlying performance. We anticipate an absence of these impacts and strong refining margins will position us very well in the second quarter. We are making outstanding progress on our high-value growth developments in Guyana, the Permian and LNG. Our new Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is up and running ahead of schedule and generated positive earnings and cash flow in its first quarter of operations. We have strengthened the balance sheet and are creating value for shareholders through an attractive dividend and increased share repurchases. We are advancing hydrogen, biofuels and other low carbon solutions consistent with our intention to lead in the energy transition, leveraging our competitive advantages of scale, integration and technology. Finally, we are evolving our organization from a holding company to an operating company to better serve our customers' evolving needs and grow long-term shareholder value. Before we take your questions, I want to acknowledge the very real impact the high prices are having on families all around the world. You may recall that we anticipated this in 2020 with industry investment levels well below those required to offset depletion. That's why we work so hard to preserve our capital expenditures during the depths of the pandemic, ensure that additional production was available to meet the eventual recovery in demand. Today, that long-term focus is paying off with growing production of industry-advantaged supply. We are continuing to focus on the fundamentals through ongoing investment in advantaged projects and low emission initiatives to ensure that we can continue to meet the critical needs of people all around the world reliably and importantly, well into the future. You're welcome, Jeanine. Good to hear from you again. Just maybe a broad comment on the LNG business. Obviously, as we're seeing across each of our sectors, the pandemic had a pretty profound effect with respect to deferring, delaying capital spend and, therefore, additional capacity coming on. And as the pandemic has subsided and demand has recovered, we're seeing very tight markets and seeing that play out really around the world, obviously, a significant impact. And then with the Ukraine and the situation there that has added a significant additional level of uncertainty around supply. And so I think a very dynamic market and a very high-priced market. And what we've seen in response to that is basically very full capacity utilization all around the world, maximizing the amount of LNG moving. Obviously, we've got our Coral LNG starting up later this year, which will help contribute and ease some of that tightness. And then you mentioned Golden Pass, which is an important leg of our strategy of making sure that we have access to LNG supplies that we can -- to supply demand all around the world, and that's a very important part of our strategy in LNG going forward is making sure that we've got barrels that we can then move and trade in the marketplace and move across the different regional demand centers. And so I think we're going to continue to look for opportunities in LNG. It's an important part of the portfolio. We've got opportunities in PNG that we're progressing obviously, additional investments on Mozambique are in the future as well. And so I think it will be a very important foundational layer of supply and a really important part of our overall business offering Yes. I would just add to that. Obviously, that would be a benefit, but it's certainly not the main driver with respect to making sure that our operations have very low emissions and very low methane emissions. And so that's a core part of our commitment in running these facilities. And to the extent the market pays a premium for that, that's an advantage that we'll look to take the advantage of. Yes, I would just emphasize the point that Kathy made, but I think one worth remembering, that this longer-term view that we took during the pandemic in trying to maintain a lot of investment, we also recognize that as economies recovered and demand picked up that we would potentially see inflation. And so we were very focused on -- in anticipation of that, trying to lock in some of the pricing and savings during all points that we could then take advantage of early on a recovery, which is considerably. And maybe the final point I would make is with the new organization, it's working hard and our leadership team is working hard to offset inflation and out of that, we think we've got a pretty good handle here, certainly in the short term. Obviously, we'll see how the market develops. Sure. Neil, yes, I can start, and I feel like we're going to be a little bit of a broken record with respect to the anchoring a lot of what we're seeing in the market today across our sectors with the pandemic. And you'll recall, as we were going through that very deep down cycle, where demand for fuels products dropped significantly, there was a lot of refinery rationalization. In fact, the refineries were shutting down at a much, much higher rate than historical averages or tons, if not higher. And so you had a lot of capacity coming out of the marketplace. There were new facilities that were planned or in progress primarily in the Middle East and out in Asia. Those got deferred and delayed because of the occurrence. And so you've got, I think this period of time where you've taken a lot of capacity out and new capacity that was planned or in progress has been deferred and delayed. And so we've got a period with lower supply. And then, of course, this demand has picked up, that has led to this very tight market and the higher margins that we're seeing. What's compounded that then is the important role that Russia plays in supplying markets around the world. And with the uncertainty associated with that supply and potential impacts of additional sanctions that's put, I think, additional concern and anxiety in the marketplace, which is leading to a very high margin environment. One, frankly, that I don't think is a sustainable one; and two, good for economies around the world. So I think we're in a bit of a very tight time frame. And as you've talked about the first quarter, obviously, we saw that evolve over the first quarter with kind of rising margins in January, February, March and now into April, very high margins. And so I think that's something that we're going to see for quite some time, certainly here this year and into next, depending on obviously work how demand plays out. Final point I make, which you touched on is, you're right, this quarter reflects that ramp-up of margins. So you're not really seeing the healthy market that we're experiencing right now in the first quarter results, that will, I think, manifest itself in the second quarter. And then some of the timing impacts we expect to see unwind. Maybe I'll let Kathy just touch on those. Yes. Thank you, Doug, and I appreciate your compliments to the IR team. I know they've been working hard to make sure that they're improving the transparency and information that you need to help understand what we're doing here and the business results that we're achieving. I think to your point on the balance sheet, and you remember what we started back in 2018 was this countercyclical approach where we lean on the balance sheet during the depths, made those investments with an eye on the fundamentals and expected recoveries and to take advantage of the ups with investments and facilities in the ground and then reinvest and lean into the down cycle. And I would tell you, generally speaking, that continues to be an ambition of ours and part of our strategy is to try to drive the countercyclical investment approach, which is -- has worked out very well for us and is paying off in today's market. But that's, I would say, 1 philosophy. Obviously, it is tempered by just the availability of cash and how deep and high the swings in this commodity cycle are. And so I think part of that balance sheet, and I want to toss it to Kathy here in a minute, let her make some comments on it, but part of that is just going to be a function of where you're at in the cycle and how severe that cycle is. And so there will be periods, I think, where you see some movement in both cash and how the balance sheet is structured. And based on where we're at and where the revenues are, and I would also tell you, though, that it's not what's not going to change is being very focused on making sure that any investment that we make is advantaged across the cycle. You'll recall my definition of disciplined investing is not an absolute level, but more of making sure that anywhere you spend money that you're convinced that you'll be the low-cost supplier with an advantage versus the rest of the industry, that will be successful as you move through the cycle. Kathy? Sure. Yes. Thank you, Stephen. I think you touched on, I think, a really important part of our strategy as we look at going forward, not only in the plastics and plastics recycling, but also in biofuels. And I think what people have thought about with respect to our refining footprint and the size of that footprint that as fuels, traditional fuels demand declines, if those assets become disadvantaged. And frankly, given the integration that we have with those facilities, if you think about our chemicals and refining facilities integrated, which are now reflected in our Product Solutions business, the fact that we've got base stocks and lubricant facilities integrated with those, they are fairly robust platforms with large scale and low cost. And what we see is the opportunity that as demand shifts to convert those facilities to produce more lower emissions fuels for biofuels and to utilize existing equipment for advanced recycling in plastics. And that's what you've seen us do in Baytown with conversion of some of our heavy cracking facilities on the refining side used to recycle waste plastic. And we've got pretty ambitious plans in that space. We like what we see there. It gives products that have all the same attributes as virgin products, but obviously, without the same -- with the ability to recycle the waste. And so we like the molecular recycling, that's where we're focusing. We think we can bring an advantage there with; one, our facilities; but two, our technology; and then three, with our marketing organization with respect to the marketing of those products.  So feel generally good about that. We've got plans to drive that recent advanced recycling to 500,000 metric tons by 2026, should have 30,000 metric tons in place by the end of this year. So I think, in total, we like what we see there. The market today is interested in those products and there is a premium out there. So right now, I think that looks pretty attractive. I suspect with time that may -- the market will stabilize, but we think it's going to be a pretty helpful market for some time to come. I think you've touched on the point that we made in our second quarter outlook with respect to the seasonality, which historically, we've seen going into the second quarter a significant drop in demand for gas. And given where the markets are at today and the level of inventories around the world, our expectation is we're not going to see the same level of demand change quarter-on-quarter, and we try to indicate that in our outlook to suggest that we will see the same level of seasonality going forward. I think, and as I said earlier with response to Jeanine's question, we do see this market being fairly tight here in the short term. Obviously, the industry is working hard to supply that, but it will -- the time cycle on investments and bringing additional supply on is fairly long, particularly in the context of where demand is at today and the tightness in the marketplace. So I think that's going to continue to be with us for a while. And as you move, as demand declines, I think we'll see supply start to move into inventory. And so that purchases will move from meeting current demand out in the marketplace to meeting the demand to fill inventory to make sure that inventories are well positioned as we move through the summer and then back into the fall and into the winter season that the markets are well supplied. And then the final point I would make there is obviously, with what's happening in Ukraine, there is a wildcard there that I think most economies and governments around the world are going to make sure that they're trying to mitigate the potential implications of that supply disruption by having good inventory levels. Yes. And I would just add to that, Sam, if you look at the work we've been doing with our organization, the changes that we've made in the structure, the consolidation of capabilities across the corporation. One of the changes we announced on April 1 was a technology organization that combines the technical skills and capabilities and the engineering capabilities across the corporation. We've seen really good results doing that in the projects area. We think we've got a real opportunity in the technology area to realize similar benefits in terms of effectiveness on top of whatever efficiencies that might come from that work. And I would say that effectiveness in that concentration of technology and really getting the organization to focus on where we can add unique value and grow competitive advantage is going to be a really important part of continuing to be a valued partner with NOCs and others all around the world. Now our strategy here is to make sure that we're in a central partner that when NOCs and other resource holders are -- or want somebody who can effectively and efficiently develop the resource and doing in a sustainable manner that the first name to come to mind is ExxonMobil and then we bring those unique capabilities. And I would tell you, I have enormous confidence that that's what's going to happen. Things that we can see in the pipeline, the opportunities that we have in front of us to become more effective at what we do I think are huge and we're looking forward to then leveraging that business opportunities in the future. Yes, sure. On Guyana, Biraj, I would tell you that, as you know, we are having tremendous success with respect to discoveries there and the characterization of that resource. And I would just say that our teams have been very focused on making sure we have a good characterization of that resource, which will then be a really important part of how we choose to develop that resource in a cost-effective way to make sure that the cost of supply and obviously, the returns for those projects lead industry. And so as we look at that, these bigger production facilities make a lot of sense when you have the resource to support and because it brings your unit cost down, brings down your cost of supply. As we look at extending those developments in other areas of the resource base, it will be a function of what we find, but I would say we would lean towards these larger developments, and we'll obviously lean towards extending some of the current developments that we have and taking advantage of whatever synergies we might have with those facilities. And so I wouldn't say there's a single recipe here. It's really tailoring the recipe to make sure that it's optimized for the development opportunities that we've got in front of us. And that's going to evolve as we better characterize the resource base. And I will just say, with respect to Golden Pass, that project and the work that we're doing there, we feel good about the progress that we're making, and we're on schedule. The concept there is not changing. Yes. Good morning, Roger. I would say the resource is a mix and depending on where you're at within the Stabroek Block, that mix changes. Our development priorities is weighted towards liquid. So I think what you'll see in our plans and the way we talk about it is there's a bias towards liquid today. And then with time, we'll see how those developments evolve. We're doing some things with the government of Guyana to bring gas onshore to help deliver more cost efficient and environmentally better. Power to the people of Guyana and give them a much lower cost energy source and a much cleaner energy source. And so there is some development gas in that space. So -- but I would say, generally, liquids weighted in obviously, as we move through the field and run the economics, we'll develop the resources that optimize capital and grow returns. Yes. I'll just start off, and then pass it to Kathy for any additional comments, but I would -- I think the short answer is no. I think we have tried to emphasize looking through the cycles, looking at the long term and making sure that the investments that we make are robust to the whole of the cycle. You remember, we were investing pretty heavily when prices were down in anticipation of longer-term fundamentals. I would say while we're in a very tight market today, we're not going to let that distract us from our focus of making sure that we have low cost of supply, industry-leading advantaged projects. And so that remains the focus. In the short-cycle stuff, I think to the extent that we stay within our credibly advantaged approach and the manufacturing processes that we've set in and the boundaries that we set with respect to the facilities that we've built, we pre-invested in and we'll continue to optimize around that, but we're not going to go outside of that broader strategy of the long ball game that we're playing in the Permian, in the interventional space. Yes. I would just add that the action that we announced this morning we're taking won't be material in the analysis that you're doing, Paul. Our intention would be to continue to deliver on the efficiency, I mean that's a -- that we had projected in our plan. Sure. Yes. I think it's an unusual time we've got in the chemical market just because we see a level of dislocation between what's happening in Asia and what we see happening in the Atlantic Basin. I think we made reference in the comments that our North America footprint in Chemical and the ethane advantage that we have has actually helped mitigate this broader downturn that we're seeing with the global chemical markets, which are heavily weighted to -- or weighted towards the downturn that we're seeing in Asia. And I think as you look at crude prices coming up and the marginal supply in olefins being a liquid cracker and naphtha feed that as that crude price goes up here, feed goes up and naphtha feed goes up. And so you've got cost increases on your feed. And because of some of the logistics constraints and the ability to kind of connect the market's demand is somewhat dislocated and so you've got oversupply in a market like China where you see some of the demand coming off lockdown and the logistics constraints. So I think you've got -- we're in a unique period right now where you're seeing some regional imbalances and inability to close those imbalances through logistics and transportation. We'll see how long it's going to last. But I think ultimately, as markets open up, we'll see those equilibrate with -- again, I think if crude remains high, my suspicion is that ethane and ethane cracking will continue to be advantaged. And then that will obviously move as crude prices move with respect to gas prices. Sure. Lucas, just to start on the back end of your question, you're right, train 1 is -- we expect to start up in 2024 and then the remaining trains in 2025. And what -- the strategic drive behind that investment and that supply point was really getting a global -- a balanced global footprint with respect to LNG supply. So that Golden Pass facility gives us an anchor point within the Americas to take advantage of the U.S. gas market and the developments that we've seen there and the supply potential that we see in U.S. gas. And so that forms a really important anchor supply point. And we intend to use that with the trading business that we're growing in LNG and use it as an ability to trade and oftentimes bridge as some of our other LNG projects are being developed to bridge and supply between those projects that allow us to optimize and make commitments for projects with flexibility in terms of using Golden Pass as a supply point and then to also just trade in the spot market. So I think it's going to give us a lot of flexibility to supplement our longer-term contracts for our bigger projects, but to also participate in the spot market. I would tell you that the LNG organization is going to basically develop that portfolio in the way that they think maximizes the value of it. So I wouldn't take anything off the table. I'm just -- I'm suggesting that it's -- we've got a lot of optionality and flexibility and the expectation is the LNG business and the individual running that take advantage of that flexibility to maximize the value, that's how I would characterize it. Yes. I would tell you that the plan that we had, and we've talked about with respect to the Permian, specifically somewhere between 10 and 12 rigs and then frac crew, something like that. And we're basically, I think, in line with that plan right now. And part of that is making sure that we're -- the developments that we're pursuing are consistent with the base infrastructure, the technology and the capital efficiency approaches that we've built into that development that tends to drive what we're doing there. I think what -- and Kathy has touched on, we, again, had anticipated the market recovery and some of the tightness and so had developed some contracting strategies and partnering with suppliers to try to mitigate that impact. That's paying off. We're seeing that advantage here in the Permian. Eventually, that obviously will roll off. Some of the consumables and some of the labor tight -- tightness that we're seeing in the Permian, obviously, that's starting to impact us as well. So we are seeing inflationary pressures. The expectation is that will continue to grow as the work activity opens up and as some of the logistics constraints get resolved. And we're basically -- we've challenged the team to try to manage that and to make sure that as we look at progressing development and grow that production that we're doing it in a constructive way and not undermining the cost of supply or the advantaged position of those barrels where they sit in the supply -- cost of supply curve for the industry. So I think we're going to -- this disciplined approach that we've talked about is not so much a spend, but in terms of efficiency and making sure that everything -- that every dollar we spend there is productive. And the challenge for that team is to make sure we don't lose productivity of the capital that we're spending."

            "name": "Kathy Mikells",
            "content": "Great. Thanks very much. So look, we don't know exactly how long the strong market conditions that we're seeing today are going to persist. And we learned some pretty tough liquidity lessons during the pandemic. So our cash balance has been building a bit. You would see that it was $11 billion as we ended the quarter. So you should expect with the backdrop of the strong market conditions that even with the higher buyback program that we announced this morning, we would be building our cash in the near term potentially between $20 billion to $30 billion over time. And so that really addresses our need for flexibility in what's an incredibly uncertain environment and ensuring that we'll continue to appropriately invest in the business and sustain the share repurchase program that we talked about through 2023. In terms of just how to think about the pace of the program, it's up to $30 billion through the end of 2023. We obviously got $2.1 billion done in this quarter. You should think about us looking to get up to a ratable pace. And that roughly, we'd be looking to get $15 billion done a year, again, looking to sustain the program kind of more consistently over this 2-year period. So that's how I would think about kind of roughly where we see our cash balance and just looking to maintain a lot of flexibility in what's a pretty uncertain environment. And we did learn some real lessons during the pandemic. We used to try and hold our cash balance, call it, between $3 billion and $5 billion and run a lot of commercial paper. And when the pandemic hit, that was quite problematic for the company. So we're going to be a little bit more conservative here in the near term. And I would just add, you asked a little bit about that top rating that we got on methane management in Poker Lake in the Permian. And we would say we really see a market over time building for lower emission products, and that really plays into that. And we would certainly hope that we'd also start to see a premium on those lower emission products, right? And we'd say that's consistent across our business, but we definitely are looking to play into that going forward. Sure. So I'll start out with just saying, we feel good about the progress that we're continuing to make. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had said we've gotten to about $5 billion in structural cost savings relative to 2019. We're now at $5.4 billion. So I'd say, overall, we feel really good about that progress. Obviously, we have now put in place the new organizational structure, which should drive incremental efficiencies on top of just driving better operations, faster speed to market, better deployment, faster deployment of resources to the highest opportunities across the company. We're not immune to inflation, obviously, and we would see a fair amount of both energy and feedstock inflation coming through the business in certain areas that put a little bit of pressure on margins. Overall, in terms of how we're managing that, it flows through 2 parts of the operation. So one is on CapEx. We feel really good about where we're at there because during the pandemic, we really took the opportunity to extend contracts on work that was coming forward. So I'd say while the shorter cycle work programs obviously have some inflationary pressure, the teams are working really hard to offset that. Overall, I'd say we really try and lever master service agreement, self-manage kind of procurement. We utilize a diverse set of global contractors across the globe in trying to really manage inflation. So through the quarter right now, I'd say we're doing a pretty good job of offsetting it, but it's obviously something that we're watching really closely. Sure. I'm happy to do that. And just to add a stat, our March refining margin was about $4 higher than the average in the quarter. So that's kind of reflecting that ramp-up that Darren just mentioned. And then obviously, in our prepared script, you would have seen us talk a fair amount to timing impacts that impacted profitability in Downstream for the quarter. I think everybody understands the mark-to-market on open derivatives, so I won't talk about that. But we had another $590 million of other timing differences. About $400 million of that was also tied to derivatives. We had $200 million that associated with cargoes where the derivatives actually closed in March, and then they reversed when the physical deliveries occurred in April. So I'd say the way you should think about that is we took a $200 million bad guy in March, and we will see a $200 million good guy in April. We also had $200 million associated with settled derivatives that we just used to ensure pricing of our refinery crude runs is ratable, right? The way you should think about that is it's kind of a wash over time. Sometimes, that pricing mechanism gives us a positive in a quarter, sometimes it gives us a negative in a quarter. Over time, it's just a wash. And then the last impact that we talked about was just commercial pricing lag, right? And the way I would think about that is we were in a steep rising price environment over the quarter. And so we had pricing that was a little bit lagging. If we're in a stable environment, that pricing will catch up. If pricing kind of turns to a downward curve, then we'd actually get a little bit of a benefit. So that's how I think about it as you're trying to model the evolution into the second quarter here. The bottom line is, obviously, we're carrying a lot of positive momentum as we stand here today. Yes. And then the only thing that I would add to that Doug is occasionally, I get the question of why don't you just go and kind of pay off all of the debt you have as a priority. And I'd say, we're really comfortable with the level of debt that we have. And obviously, our gross debt-to-cap is at the lower end of the range that we talked about. And we said we're going to carry a little bit of a higher cash balance just reflective of the volatility that we've really seen in the market. So that's how I think you should think about it. But we're very comfortable with our level of debt and just being able to kind of manage at that level through the cycle. Sure. I'm happy to take that, Sam. So first of all, I would just remind you that we do have CapEx guidance that's out there, obviously, for this year, it's'21 to 24. And we've talked about kind of through 2027 range of 20 to 25. Now within that, we always try to leave ourselves a little bit of room understanding that there's these opportunities that can come up in the future. And obviously, we've made some investments in the type of opportunities that you're talking about in the past. And by the way, Golden Pass is a JV that we have with foreign investment that sits behind it as well. So I'd say we don't feel any particular pressure. I just reference back to what Darren said earlier, which is, we spend capital when we have confidence behind the projects and the returns that those projects are going to offer, right? And we're, I'd say, very, very disciplined at pressure testing those projects to make sure they're resilience across the, I'd say, wide set of market environment, given the cyclicality that we have in the business. So we feel great about the opportunities that stand in front of us right now. Obviously, we've got a low cost of supply barrels that we're investing in, be it Guyana or the Permian, Brazil. Darren mentioned the LNG projects that we're moving forward, which we feel really good about. Obviously, we've got in a Product Solution space, investments that we continue to make to support growth in high-value products, right, and to keep, I'd say, optimizing our Downstream circuit. So we feel good about that. If there's opportunities where we feel like there's a good return to be earned, we'll certainly look at potentially participating in those opportunities. But we're going to be very disciplined in our approach as you should expect from us. Yes. And I would say, certainly, timing over what's a relatively long-term period is something that we're trying to give a little flexibility for. I'd actually point to what we talked about on the Payara Guyana project. Originally, we said that was going to start up in 2024, and now we're saying we think it's likely it will start up at the end of 2023. So that would be an example of, we have initial planning that we do, but obviously, accelerating projects if we can bring them in, in a shorter time frame. And obviously, on or under budget is something we're always focused on. Sure. So overall, I think we talked a little bit about inflation on CapEx and the fact that certainly in the near term, we're feeling pretty good because we did a lot of work during the pandemic. So we had caused some projects. And during the pandemic, we did a lot of work to actually put the contracts in place like finish the engineering and put the contracts in place at a point where I'd say there was some deflationary pressures in the market. So as it relates to our overall capital projects, we feel pretty good over the next couple of years. And obviously, strategically, the timing of when we do the engineering, when we go out to procurement, is something that we're always looking at and taking into consideration. And then I mentioned the fact that doing our own procurement globally to make sure that we're getting globally competitive bids is something else we do. We do spend a lot of money over the years as we're looking forward on the boats associated with Guyana development. And again, we approach that in a really strategic manner, so that we're managing those projects to the lowest cost, getting the specific design that we need. So that's how I would really discuss what's happening with regard to inflation."

I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. We appreciate you joining the call today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm joined today by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the fourth quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will give you an overview of our 2023 performance. Then, we will take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcement about acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources, we\u2019ve included additional information about the transaction on Slide 2. Please be aware that this presentation is not intended to be a solicitation of any vote or approval. During today's call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, including an overview of full-year results, which are posted on the website. And now, I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I want to start with the theme of the quarter, which frankly, has been a theme of the year, excellence in execution. Whether it\u2019s operating our facilities, building projects, deploying technologies, trading, marketing, sales, supply chain, or any of our other activities, the men and women of ExxonMobil are setting and holding themselves to very high standards as they execute their responsibilities. Their hard work and commitment drove the strong results we reported today and are the foundation of our success. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about our people. They make the difference and are delivering industry-leading results. And nothing is more important than the safety of our people. Keeping them safe requires intense focus and relentless discipline, 24 hours a day, every single day. For many years we\u2019ve outperformed industry benchmarks for workplace safety. Over the last several years we\u2019ve been implementing improved systems for managing both personnel and process safety, leveraging best practices from across our company and industry, our own and others. These efforts are paying off with continued improvements in the number and severity of incidents. The discipline needed to consistently deliver industry-leading safety performance manifests itself in all our work. We see it in our project teams, who are delivering large capital projects at top-quintile performance on cost and schedule. We see it in the reliability of our operations, where we achieved record performance in both the upstream and refining. We see it in our environmental performance, where we set several new records. And we see it in the successful management of the transformational re-organizations we\u2019ve made over the last several years. Results are clear. By any measure, 2023 was an outstanding year. We delivered $36 billion of earnings, strong cash flows, and a 15% return on capital employed. Our strategy, introduced in 2018, coupled with consistently strong execution, is delivering results that lead industry across a range of metrics, including earnings and cash flow growth, total shareholder distributions, and total shareholder returns since 2019, the baseline year of our plans. On a constant-price basis, we more than doubled earnings in 2023 versus 2019, demonstrating the improved earnings power of the company. The growth in profitability reflects significant progress in high-grading our portfolio of assets through advantaged projects, divestment of less strategic operations, and significant cost reductions. During the year, our divestments generated more than $4 billion of cash proceeds. And we also announced two value-accretive acquisitions. Denbury, which closed in November, provides opportunities to profitably accelerate our Low Carbon Solutions business with a compelling, end-to-end, customer decarbonization offer. Pioneer, which is expected to close in the second quarter, will further differentiate our advantaged Upstream portfolio. The synergies will create significant shareholder value and accelerate Pioneer\u2019s net zero ambitions by 15 years, to 2035. In 2023, we made significant advances in a number of innovative solutions. We entered the lithium business, where we see an opportunity to supply approximately 1 million electric vehicles per year by 2030 with economically advantaged production that has a much smaller environmental impact than today\u2019s supply. In the carbon capture and storage space, we recently completed the construction of a pilot plant to further develop a unique, proprietary technology, which has the potential to significantly lower the cost of direct air capture. We also launched Proxxima, a thermoset resin with a high value in use for coatings, infrastructure, automotive parts, and wind power, made from low value components used in gasoline. We also took a further step in reducing cost, leveraging scale and improving effectiveness with the formation of three new centralized organizations, Global Supply, Trading, and Global Business Solutions. This change provides additional opportunities to grow deep expertise across a broad portfolio of critical business capabilities. Today, we\u2019re convinced that no other company can match the depth and breadth of development opportunities that ExxonMobil offers. It\u2019s no surprise that for the 11th year in a row, we were recognized as the most attractive US employer in the industry for engineering students. This is another key competitive advantage. Our plan for 2024 remains anchored in our existing strategy, building on world-class execution and the performance we delivered last year. We set a high bar for ourselves across all aspects of the business, from safety to operational excellence to financial performance, and have confidence in our team's ability to consistently deliver. For 2024, we expect to invest $23 billion to $25 billion to grow our portfolio of advantaged, low-cost of supply assets, further shift our product mix towards higher value, higher margin performance products, and reduce emissions, both our own and others. Our plan also continues to structurally reduce costs to achieve $15 billion in structural cost savings through 2027. We have opportunities to enhance supply chain efficiency, further improve maintenance and turnarounds, modernize data management, and simplify business processes. In Low Carbon Solutions, we\u2019ll continue the integration of Denbury and look to add additional customers to our US Gulf Coast network. As we noted during the Corporate Plan update in December, we\u2019re now pursuing more than $20 billion of lower emissions opportunities, evenly split between reducing our own emissions and reducing third-party emissions. Overall, our portfolio of low carbon investments is expected to generate returns of approximately 15%. Our Upstream portfolio will be further transformed when we close on the transaction with Pioneer. By combining the capabilities of our two companies and leveraging the advances we\u2019ve made in technology, we expect to recover more resource, more efficiently, with lower emissions. We\u2019ll provide more detail about this compelling combination at our Spotlight event following the close. Our results in 2023 once again demonstrated the strength of our strategy. As I reflect on the past year, I have tremendous pride in what our people accomplished and a strong level of confidence in our continued ability to lead in the years ahead. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Now, I'll turn it back to Jennifer.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a courtesy to others in the queue, we ask all of our analysts to limit themselves to one question. However, please remain on the line in case you need any clarification. With that, operator, let's open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah, good morning, Darren, team, and congrats on the strong results. My question was around the structural cost savings. So we're at $9.7 billion versus 2019 and targeting $15 billion by 2027. Can you talk about the progression over the next couple of years? What are the key buckets and milestones we should be watching out for as it relates to those cost savings?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Thanks, Neil. Good to hear from you again. Maybe just start with a little bit of perspective. If you think about where we have been driving efficiencies and what lies behind the improvements in structural cost. We've made tremendous changes in the organization and we've been doing that each successive year, sequenced with respect to what needs to come first, second, and third to make sure that we can effectively manage that. We're still in the early stages of taking advantage of all the changes that we've made going back in time with our global technology organization, with our product solutions organization that frankly brought refining together with our marketing and then together with chemical. So a lot of restructuring, a lot of opportunities, and all the organizations see a path to significantly improved effectiveness in executing the business and, to your point, a significant path to efficiencies. On top of that, we just launched our global supply chain organization. We just launched our global business solutions organization and our trading organization. So they're early in their process, and all of them see significant opportunities for efficiency. So I would say $9.7 billion is a reflection of the hard work coming from the reorganizations that we've done and we're early in that and then we've got additional reorganizations to take advantage of. That $15 billion that you referred to is not a target, it is in our plans and the plans reflect what the organizations are working on. So what are some of the areas? We've seen a lot of benefit today by a centralized approach to enhancing our maintenance and our turnaround processes. We've taken a lot of cost out with respect to that. We see an opportunity to bring further cost reductions there. The supply chain organization brings a huge opportunity. In the past, we had very fragmented supply chain organizations across all of our businesses. We've now consolidated all that. We see a lot of opportunities to bring together our data and our processes and harmonize those and do those consistently across all of the organization. And then a lot of continuing optimization within the base business, taking advantage of the new construct and learning from one another, that's a huge part of the go-forward reduction. So I would just tie all that to the ongoing change and the fact that we now have a good line of sight across all of our organizations around the best way to do things and the most efficient ways to do things. I'll hand it over to Kathy if there's anything to add to that.\nKathy Mikells: The only other thing I would add is how we're looking to leverage technology to both drive incremental efficiency but as importantly to drive effectiveness. So things like how we use artificial intelligence and chat box in our customer care centers, right, which gives our customers better service. And obviously, that drives efficiency for the company. How we use predictive analytics and things like driving maintenance turnarounds to top kind of quintile type performance or similarly how we use those predictive analytics in our drilling and fracking centralized operation here in Houston. So bringing together our information technology organization with our engineering and research organization will just further enhance, I think, how overall we as a technology company fundamentally try to use technology to both drive efficiency but obviously to drive value in the business.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, Kathy. Thanks, Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Darren, 2018 was a long time ago obviously and a lot has changed since you pushed the doubling of cash flow from \u201825 to \u201827, including much greater and perhaps faster progress in Guyana. So I guess my question is, where do you -- where would you suggest we are in 2024 in moving towards that doubling of cash flow target, and specifically, what should we read about your CapEx comments in terms of the timing of Guyana as part of that target?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the back end of your question around the CapEx. I mean, it should be clear, hopefully it's clear, we've provided guidance in a range in CapEx to give you a perspective of when we start the year based on the plans that we put together the previous year where we think we're going to end up and spend across the year. Obviously as we're going through the business, each of the businesses are clear on their objective to find value creative opportunities and to capture those as quickly as possible. So we've got an ongoing process. If we see an opportunity that we weren't aware of at the time of putting together the plan, we're not constraining our activities based on some artificial number or the guidance that we've put out. We're very focused on making sure that it's going to be an effective use of capital, that we can efficiently execute what's required for that capital, and then that there's value behind it and there's an advantage in it. So that's how we're managing. What we talked about in the release with respect to our CapEx in 2023 reflects just that, incremental optimizations as we're going through the year. And my view is we'll continue to do that as we go forward into the plan years. Obviously, we've given you some guidance that we believe reflect where we'll end up. But as we work the opportunities, we're very focused on that. I think, the short term, what we've done with Guyana, you're seeing today in Payara, where we brought that online. And frankly, in January, well ahead of our plans, reached nameplate capacity. And part of that was around the optimization of the drilling and making sure that we had what we needed to bring that up quickly. In terms of the broader objective to get to 2027, I mean we're on that plan and we're actually delivering the value that we laid out in 2018. So I feel really good about the progress we've made. We noted in the release that if you look at just from 2019, the year before the pandemic, the advances that we've made in the business, on a flat price, take margin, take price out of it, we've doubled the earnings capacity of the corporation from 2019 to 2023. We've grown earnings at compounded annual basis by 40%, greater than 40%. We've grown cash flow from operations almost 20%, greater than 15%. So I think significant progress we've demonstrated at the work that we're doing, projects that we've put in place, the reorganizations that we've executed, the cost that we're cutting out of the business are all driving us towards this improved valuation and frankly the plans we have going forward are going to continue to do that. So the targets that we've laid out, what we communicated in our December company plan release, basically those are plans and we feel that we're right on track if not slightly ahead of delivering on those. Kathy, anything to add to that?\nKathy Mikells: Yeah, I mean, Doug, I'll just try to grind kind of back to those numbers a little bit more just so you understand that on an earnings basis, we actually more than doubled earnings on again that constant price basis that we used in our corporate plan which Darren is referring to in the numbers that he just mentioned. So I would absolutely say we are ahead of our plan in terms of what it is that we're achieving. And it's that earnings improvement that is flowing through to cash flow. And so as you think about cash flow, our earnings expectation in the corporate plan in terms of doubling it out to 2027, it's well ahead of doubling it. And then those earnings just flow through to the cash flow growth. So I would describe us as being ahead of plan in terms of where we stand today and feeling very good about the future.\nDoug Leggate: I think we would concur. Thank you very much indeed.\nOperator: The next question is from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I've gotten some inbounds this morning just on the 2023 spending. And, Darren, you kind of alluded to it in your response to the prior question. You were able to pull forward some CapEx for Guyana and Permian in 4Q. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of that, the types of efficiencies that you're seeing and what specifically you're able to accelerate and then how that influences your outlook for spending and production in both -- for both assets in 2024?\nDarren Woods: Well if you think about -- sure, and good morning, Devin. If you think about the complexity of what the organizations are dealing with and in particular the upstream that as we -- as you go through the course of the year, and they're drilling, and they're collecting data, and we're seeing the production, we've got a real-time optimization loop that takes the experience that we've had and builds it back into our go-forward plan. So it is a very dynamic process. And we've got, to Kathy's point, at lot of -- we're using a lot of technology to make sure that we're learning from all the data that we're collecting as we go and that we're adjusting our plans to optimize value. I would tell you, the organization understands it has an obligation to drive value and to find the value opportunities and to make sure that when we decide to spend money that we know that spend is going to be productive spend and that we're going to be efficient in executing that spend. And beyond that, they're not constrained. If they find that we're going to hit a constraint or we're going to hit something that's not incorporated in the plans, we have a conversation about that. So I would tell you it is a very well controlled process. Your point about capital coming forward in the fourth quarter, I would tell you the decisions that we made that led to going a little above the guidance weren't made in the fourth quarter. Those were made as we were going through the year with the recognition that if we took some of the steps as we were going through the year, that as we got to the end of the year, those numbers would grow potentially but up on -- well, slightly above the guidance. And we made the decisions as we were going. And it's a very dynamic process. So I think that's how I would think about it, that we're going to continue doing that going forward. Obviously, the Permian, we continue to learn with the technologies that we're bringing in there, the techniques that we keep evolving. So my expectation is we'll continue to adjust as we go to maximize the value of the production and what we're learning through the technologies that we're deploying. And then with Guyana, I mean don't underestimate the complexity of these reservoirs and the challenges the organization has. So as they're drilling and gaining information, we're optimizing that as we go as well. And if we see an opportunity to advance the development and bring it forward and bring [NPV] (ph) with that, we'll take that. And so I would just tell you, it's hard to predict because what are you going to learn? I mean, if we knew that now, it wouldn't be a learning. We'd know it. It would be built into the plan. So it's hard to really predict the learning piece of it. Anything to add, Kathy?\nKathy Mikells: I\u2019d just say if you look at the specifics of what we delivered as a result of actually spending a little bit more on CapEx, I think you see that just goes hand in hand to how we drove value for shareholders. So in the Permian, we had guided to 600,000 kind of oil equivalent barrels, we came in at 620,000. In Guyana, we had said 380,000, we came in at 390,000 right? And you think about where we're at in Guyana today and we've got Prosperity, the third boat which is in the Payara development already up to nameplate capacity as we stand here today. And that's because we made the decision to drill more wells to ensure that we could get that boat up to capacity as quickly as possible and our organization absolutely delivered on that. So those were the right economic decisions that drove value for our shareholders.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Yeah, I agree the strategy is certainly yielding great results. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from John Royall of JP Morgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on Payara. You've expressed some confidence that you can ultimately get above the nameplate as you have on the first two platforms. Should we expect kind of a continuous ramp towards a higher number or does it run closer to nameplate for a period of time and then further unlock happens kind of more in a step change?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, good morning, John. Thanks for the question. I think, just maybe step back and talk a little bit about the process. Organization does its best to design the projects for the capacities that we want to deliver and then as they hand the cap, the projects group hands that off to the operating group. They're obviously, as they begin operation testing to see where we are with respect to constraints and every -- the advantage that we have here is that we've tried to stick to some consistent design. This design [won\u2019t build many] (ph) concept, we've tried to the extent possible, maintain consistency from boat to boat. Obviously, as the subsurface and the complexity of the developments change, we have to make adjustments. So it's not quite a cookie cutter approach, but we tried to maintain a level of consistency. One, because that keeps your capital cost down. But two, it allows us to take the learnings from the previous boats and apply it to the one we just started up, and advance things faster to do things quicker. And a great example for Prosperity is how quickly we managed to bring that unit up and get flaring down and get to nameplate capacity. That was -- we did that essentially at record times, which is a reflection of the fact that the organization as they've been bringing these units -- these production units on line that they're learning and then taking those learnings and forwarding it to the next post. So my expectation is you'll see us move faster and faster as we go. Difficult to predict exactly what that ramp up looks like or the step changes if you will because it'll be a function of what they bring into -- what the next constraint that they overcome to make sure that we can continue to run those facilities safely within all the operating limits but at the same time maximize their value. And so I would say take the previous ramp ups as a basis and then our expectation is the organization will find ways to do it even better.\nKathy Mikells: And then if you don't mind, I'm just going to add because I know everybody is now going to be modeling what Guyana is going to look like for the year. So this is just a reminder that at some point in the second half we're working on the gas to energy project, right, and laying the pipeline down to bring that gas from Liza 1 and Liza 2 onshore, to basically kind of plug it into the power plant that ultimately will drive down costs for consumers in Guyana. And we will be taking Liza 1 and Liza 2 offline for a period of time as we kind of hook them up to that pipeline. So that's just a reminder that we'll have a little bit of downtime at some point in the second half.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning all. At the risk of oversimplifying, if I think about 2023, it was a very strategy-focused year, Denbury, Pioneer, Lithium. If I look at 2025, it's a major project delivery year. 2024, is this a year of execution or could there be some level of strategic interesting moves that we should think about?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, good morning, Bob. I would just say you have oversimplified it. I would start with every year is a year of execution. And I think it's the fact that we have managed maybe in comparison to some of our peers to make it look easy and have executed, I think, at a high level. Make no mistake, the organization, that is a -- continues to be a real challenge across all of our operations. And I think the men and women of ExxonMobil have done an outstanding job of consistently executing to a very high standard, as I said in my prepared remarks. So I don't want to take anything away from that and I also don't want to suggest that we, for a minute, take that for granted or take our eye off of that ball. And so that's job number one. And even in bringing these projects online, that takes a tremendous amount of focus and discipline from an execution standpoint. So that is job one. And then obviously the strategy, that is also an emphasis every year. It's just, as we've always talked about, it's really a function of can we find the right opportunities, the right equation that brings value to our shareholders. And if it's M&A, it's got to be one plus one has to equal three or more. If it's a project, it's got to be advantageous, it's got to position ourselves on the very far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. And so we've laid out what we know of and what we see ahead of us, certainly in the capital standpoint, but as the organization continues to execute and continues to look for ways to translate the strategy into bottom line value, we find new opportunities and then we don't hesitate to go after those if they meet our criteria with respect to the advantages and they are within our ability to effectively execute. So I wouldn't say 2024 there's any different emphasis than there was in 2023. The project piece of it, frankly that's the way the projects have been developed and kind of the work that's required to deliver those has led to that 2024 year of execution. But I wouldn't read more into that than just the scheduling of the projects.\nBob Brackett: Very clear. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: You bet. Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Great, thank you. Maybe if I could ask one, with the Denbury deal now closed, can you talk about what we might see over the course of the next year or two, particularly on the carbon capture business? Should we start to see announcements or notable signs of acceleration or efforts on that side?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, sure. I think the Denbury acquisition, just maybe a slight update on that first is, we've closed it, we've been going through the integration process and frankly continue to be very pleased with what we see as the opportunities to integrate that with the work we're doing around our Low Carbon Solutions business in carbon capture. So we see huge potential in terms of linking together all the opportunities to reduce emissions, high concentration emissions along the US Gulf Coast and along that pipeline system. So the team's doing a lot of work around developing the business there, a lot of work with potential customers around how we can help capture their emissions, and a lot of work around the operations and improving and growing the capacity of that pipeline. So all that's ongoing. My expectation is, with time, when we -- as we negotiate the opportunities with customers, we'll see more and more deals that bring emissions into that pipeline. That's certainly the plan. But I would tell you we're very focused on building this business for the long term. If you think about what we're trying to do there with respect to addressing the risk of climate change and significantly reducing emissions for third parties, that's a business that doesn't exist today anywhere in the world. We're trying to make sure that as the first mover here that we establish a very strong foundation for business that we expect to be around for decades to come. And so my guidance to the team is while we want to move quickly to reduce emissions and to get customers and to grow the volume of emissions we're reducing, we don't want to do that and sacrifice the value opportunity here. And so we're striking that balance. And I think what you'll see happen is, we'll bring on customers and grow that business in a way that is value-accretive and generates the returns that we need for the capital in that business.\nRyan Todd: Okay, thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question on gas realizations because they were just well ahead of, at least what we had modeled using the kind of rules of thumb and the portfolio mix you put out before. So is it just a case of the trading contribution coming into that number or is there something else driving that? And then just one quick clarification on the underlying cash flow from operations. Again, that was ahead of where the earnings beat would have suggested it would have been. So is there anything one-off in nature in the CFFO number that we should be aware of for 4Q? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yeah, I'll let Kathy address the cashflow thing. And I'll just say from a gas realization standpoint, I don't think there's anything unique in terms of what was realized as we went through the quarter. Obviously, we've been growing our trading business and that is going to manifest itself and our results, we're going to see that in our energy business, we're going to see that in our gas businesses. So that will continue to kind of, and as volatility changes and opportunities in the market change, we'll see that kind of ebb and flow. But we expect to see with time, a continued growth, structural improvement in the earnings with the work that we're doing in the trading space. And then I think quarter-on-quarter we're going to see changes in mix as we move across the quarters. And so we'll see some variation there. But I wouldn't put anything structurally other than the trading work that we've been doing and to our realizations. And I'll hand it to Kathy for any other comments on that and the cash flow.\nKathy Mikells: Yep. And so I'll just speak specifically to cash flow from operations and I think you're referencing the quarter but I'm happy to talk about the quarter and the year. Our cash flow from operations, if you look at the quarter was $13.7 billion. If you exclude working capital, we would have been at $16.9 billion. You're mentioning a beat relative to the street, and so was there anything unusual going on? As I look at people's models, I think sometimes they struggle to get depreciation and amortization right, so that's the only thing I'm going to speak to. And when we have a quarter where we're taking impairments, then we get an increase kind of in terms of a non-cash add back that flows through to cash flow from operations and we obviously took an impairment in the quarter. So that's my best guess as to anything that might be nuanced. Otherwise, no, nothing particularly unusual going on.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Okay, understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to come back to CapEx if possible, just because, when the organization's performing so well as it is, it feels like there's always going to be opportunities to pull something forward or for people throughout the organization to kind of pursue their incentives and spend a bit more. And obviously this is something that's been a topic in the industry for a long time. And so particularly like, as we look at your Permian results, it looks like your \u201823 wells are still improving and everything's getting better. So I guess the question is, how do we think about this with respect to your planning when it feels like there's always going to constantly be opportunities for you to add kind of nickels and dimes to CapEx to do some quick and high return opportunities? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Sam. I would -- I guess I'd take exception to the characterization that you've laid out there. It's not a function of the organization throwing additional nickels and dimes. We have pretty focused work programs to drive value here and frankly any discussion about spending additional money or making additional investments above and beyond what we've planned for has to come to the management committee. And so we've got pretty tight controls around making sure we understand what's the value proposition, how unique is the value proposition. This is not something we just turn loose to the organization and they start throwing on money as and when they see the opportunities to do that. So that's I think, the characterization that it's hard to hang on to this. I would think -- I would point to the success that we've had to date where we've delivered what is a very accretive advantaged set of capital projects. I think our track record demonstrates that we are not about going after volume or going after marginal investment opportunities. These things have to be unique. The hurdle to get into the capital plan is pretty high. We have -- if you look across the industry, we have a clear understanding of cost of supply. We know where we sit on the cost of supply curve. We know as new projects or opportunities come forward, we look at those in terms of where they sit from a competitive standpoint. They have to have a structural advantage. They have to be robust and resilient to the bottom of cycle conditions. If you lay all those conditions on, it's a fairly tight funnel that people have to get their spend through. And that doesn't change. That has not changed. And so I would just say, if we spend additional money, that money is going to deliver more than what was in the base plan frankly because it's on the margin. And I'll come back to, at the end of the day, we're not judging ourselves by basing -- by hitting some number that we've, or guidance that we've given from a year ago. We're judging ourselves on the ability to generate advantaged projects. And again, I just point you to the results that we are delivering. To grow earnings on a compounded basis at twice what the nearest competitor has done, or to grow cash flow from operations at twice what the next nearest competitor has done, doesn't come from investing in things that don't have the advantage that I just talked about. So I think our track record and the results that we're delivering demonstrate that the approach that we've taken here is working, and we're not going to vary off of that approach.\nKathy Mikells: And then I\u2019d just add one more comment, and that is, we almost take for granted how many projects we've actually been able to pull forward and deliver either on time or ahead of time. And Payara is a great example of that. It was originally targeted to actually start up in 2024 and we were able to pull it forward. We were then able to pull forward incremental well drilling in order to get that FPSO up to operating nameplate capacity in an extraordinarily short amount of time. I'd say this is one of the areas that really differentiates ExxonMobil from other companies. Our top -- really top performance and execution and pulling projects forward is always a positive economic decision, right, because we're going to end up then getting the benefit of the profits from those projects sooner or later. So very much a decision that's aligned with driving value, which is what sits behind all of our decision making.\nSam Margolin: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Yeah, hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to get your take on the outlook for the chemicals market going forward. 2023 was a bit of a trough year. Some of the industry participants are saying maybe we're getting close to turning the corner. And that would be meaningful given all the underlying investments that Exxon has made in the chemicals business. So just wondering your view on potential for market improvement and seeing the full force of some of those investments come through.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Good morning, Jason. Yeah, I think I would concur with your characterization of 2023 as being kind of at the bottom of the trough. It was definitely a challenging year, well below, I think, the bottoms of previous cycles. But I would say that, and we're quite proud of the fact that the investments that we've brought on were earnings and cash positive in the bottom of the cycle, which frankly is exactly in line with -- I was just talking about the strategy that we have and the criteria that we require our projects that they have to be robust to bottom of the cycle conditions. And in the chemical business, we definitely demonstrated that, that the projects -- the new projects that we've brought on, that have some run time in them, are earnings and cash positive, even in these very challenging conditions. So I think like many others in the chemical industry, we'd like to see us come out of the trough and when we do, our expectation is the capital that we've brought on will obviously be performing even better with better margins. I would say as well with respect to turning points, we have seen some -- we certainly saw in the fourth quarter some slight improvements. There's still a lot of capacity that's come on out there. We still see a reasonably good growth, particularly for ExxonMobil in our performance product category. We have set some pretty aggressive targets to grow our high performance, high value chemical products and we're seeing that happen. So we feel really good about the pipeline and the development of our sales. And then the question is when does the broader industry turn and you start to see margins improve? My expectation is 2024 might be marginally better than 2023, but we're not expecting significant change in the vector, but more of a gradual one as we work our way through all the supply that's come on in the recent years and some of the supply will come on in 2024 and 2025. So I think it will be a gradual recovery but frankly one that we feel very comfortable with based on the advantages that we have with our capacity, the advantages that we have with our footprint, and the flexibility we have to optimize on feed and products. So we're positioned for this kind of market. I think the results demonstrate that. And we're going to ride it and see where the market goes.\nJason Gabelman: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning.\nDarren Woods: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: Darren and Kathy, I want to ask about the trading operation. I think it seems like it's a very good trading year for you and a lot of your peers in Europe. Can you help us to maybe quantify that? What is the trading benefit for the year, whether in terms of millions of dollars or in terms of improvement in the return and whether that you think that is a repeatable? And after more than the last two or three years, what have you learned? Is there anything that you will do differently going forward in your trading operation? And whether you see the first quarter optimization opportunity set, is it similar to what you\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter, or is it getting worse or getting better? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yeah, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'll give you a perspective and then let Kathy build on that. And maybe just to go back in time a little bit, we talked about the trading opportunity within ExxonMobil for quite some time. I think there's some skepticism out there as to whether we could actually build that business. But the foundation of our trading operations is a function of the global footprint that we have, the span of the businesses that we have, the integrated nature of the businesses that we have that we felt like gave us a physical footprint and presence in markets all around the world to effectively trade on and to build a business from that footprint and obviously the perspectives and insights that come with operating that footprint in those mix of businesses. And that, I would say as we've grown our trading capability on that premise, optimizing our assets, building on our assets, that it has proven to be very effective, that that strategy is bearing out and that we see continued opportunity to grow that. And I think as we've talked about here, we were going to take a very measured approach and we weren't in a hurry, we weren't going to rush through this, we were going to make sure that what we do is structurally sound that we\u2019re not -- and that we're managing the risk as well as capturing the rewards and we've been doing that. So 2023 I think was off of the highs we saw in 2022 because of where the market is at, but still reflected, I think, very solid contributions based on the capabilities of the organization that we have been building. And we have got more to do there. My expectation is that you will see improved trading results embedded in our businesses because frankly those -- that trading organization's objective is to enhance the value of the businesses. We don't want a trading organization that's competing against the base business. We want a trading organization that's working with the base business to optimize value for the corporation. And they're doing that and those earnings accrue to the businesses that they're trading on behalf of. But I'm very pleased with what we saw in 2023. Obviously, the market and volatility is going to have a function -- will function heavily or play a heavy function year in year in terms of what we actually deliver. But structurally, we've got a really sound base that we're growing and I think we're going to continue to see improvement in that space. Kathy, anything to add?\nKathy Mikells: Yeah, the only other thing that I'd add to that is if you looked at our trading results on a year-on-year basis, in upstream we were lapping kind of a big mark-to-market gain in 2022, right? So that impacted our results. And I've mentioned time and time again that quarterly results, especially as a result of that movement in mark-to-market, will kind of ebb and flow. And sometimes we get price timing nuances in the quarter. As we came to the end of this year, those price timing nuances that we saw in the third quarter had fully unwound by the fourth quarter. So I think we start the year overall in a pretty good place.\nPaul Cheng: Kathy, is there a number you can share in terms of what's the contribution for trading for the year?\nKathy Mikells: No, we don't disclose that. And I think actually all our peers have a pretty high sensitivity to just -- competitive sensitivity in terms of disclosing that number. But I think Darren put overall things into a good context, which is last year was record earnings for the company and it was record trading earnings. And so we had a strong result this year in trading, but it was down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And then I mentioned specifically in upstream that we were lapping favorability in terms of mark-to-market favorable gain in 2022.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: Hi. Good morning, Darren and team. My question is on the Permian, specifically your continued record production to play. It appears, at least from what I'm seeing going forward, your [pro forma] (ph) Permian activity is likely to continue trending higher. And I'm just wondering, maybe, Darren, how you'd respond to maybe any critics who suggest all US companies should instead maintain flat production in order to, I guess, appease Saudi and the others maybe more so.\nDarren Woods: Yeah, well, thanks for the question. No, I would just tell you there's -- we're not going to run the business to appease an external member out there. I think the way we look at it is, can we find -- it comes back to every dollar that we choose to invest and spend. Do we see a return? Are we convinced that we're effectively spending that money and we're spending it efficiently? That's the criteria that we're using. That's the plans that we've built. We expect to grow our volumes in 2024 to about 650 Kbd. And then we're going to continue that growth through to the targets that we've laid out in 2027 of about a million barrels a day -- close to a million barrels a day. So that's the plan that we have. We're executing to that plan. And as we've said before, year-on-year, it's not straight ratable growth. It'll be lumpy growth. But over time, it'll average about 13%. And we haven't seen anything to date that would say that's going to change. Obviously as we bring Pioneer into the fold, we'll bring their production in and look to kind of optimize across that portfolio that both companies have. And as we've said before, that once we close on that, we'll come back out and have a spotlight where we share what the implications of bringing these two companies together and the impact on our Permian production.\nNeal Dingmann: Yeah, makes a ton of sense. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: The next question is from Lucas Herrmann of BNP Paribas.\nLucas Herrmann: Yeah, thanks very much. And [glad to have the opportunity] (ph) to talk with you. Following on from the Permian question, actually, Darren, when you were asked about the pace of growth in 2024 in the Permian, I think the time of the capital budget release, one of the comments you made was a desire to build drilled uncompleted wells. I just wondered whether you could talk a little bit around the concept of building inventory, why the need, why put more wells into inventory? Is it very simply adding flexibility to the business in order to maintain the production profile going forward? So what's the thinking? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yeah, I'm happy to do that. And you remember correctly, we did say we were going to build some more DUCs. And I would think about that. And you used the right word, inventory, like any inventory that we have in the business, which is, if you're optimizing what is a pretty complex system of drilling and fracking and managing simultaneous ops and how you schedule all that and how it interfaces with each other and the planning piece of it, you want to have a little bit of inventory that allows you to continue at a pace and manage around some of the complexities and potential conflicts that you have in developing the acreage. And you'll recall that what we are doing in the Permian, in the Delaware in particular, is this manufacturing approach where we're laying out these spines and then executing like a manufacturing organization down that. So it is a very paced and continuum of work and production. So there are constraints that you hit as you're doing that consistently across all that acreage and having some DUCs available to us allows us to when we run into an issue with what we're doing in the immediate vicinity, we have some other opportunities to continue the production. So we use it like any other inventory. Now, obviously the trick is to get that inventory level right. You don't want a bunch of capital sitting there that isn't earning its return. This, we think we've got to an optimized level that allows us to keep a very efficient, I'd say, manufacturing process running versus a focus on production and production process.\nLucas Herrmann: Thank you. That's helpful.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering and Company.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning, everyone. Appreciate the time. Going back to carbon capture, I was interested in the comment early on about the pilot plan and the potential to lower the costs of direct air capture. Now, imagine there are limitations on what you can share just given, as you mentioned, the proprietary nature of the tech here. But with other key players in the energy space, particularly on the service side, exploring new technologies for this, just thought it would be great to get any commentary you can speak to on key learning so far from this pilot plan and the magnitude of potential savings. Where you see the most opportunity to improve the cost structure and what kind of capital investment that I guess the low carbon solutions business overall might involve over the near term?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, sure. I think, and you rightly so pointed out the proprietary nature, so I will limit some of the details of what we're talking about there, but maybe just from a broader contact standpoint, we're convinced that carbon capture is going to play a really important role in helping society meet its ambitions to get to net zero or to make certainly significant reductions in carbon emissions. I think it makes a lot of sense to, rather than tear up and throw away the existing infrastructure and the industries that we have in place that are intensive energy users, that we find a way to deal with the problem, which is the emissions. So I think carbon capture plays a role there. The technology that we have today, frankly, wasn't developed for this application. It has a use and can be deployed today for high concentration streams. But as you move down the emissions profile and get to lower and lower concentrations of CO2 streams, the existing technology is challenged. And so it becomes very expensive for every ton of carbon that you reduce. And so the challenge is use the existing technology today for these high concentration streams where you can make the economics work, but then find a lower cost method to deploy for these less concentrated streams that still make it economic. So that's been the challenge that we're working on, recognizing that the existing technology was designed for a different purpose. We need a new technology here and we're trying to take advantage of material science development, things have happened with materials, with nanostructures. There's a lot of advances in technology since the existing technology was developed. And so there's a question of how can we better capture CO2 by using advances in the existing technology. We think we've come up with an opportunity to potentially do that, but it's early days like all these technology developments. And so we built a pilot plant and we'll see and test out some of these new capabilities and test the cost effectiveness of capture. I'd say our first step, we're looking to get about a cost reduction of about half. But I would tell you that's still not enough. But if we can see a significant step change in that cost or path to that cost reduction, that gives us hope that we can then continue to advance that and get it back -- get it down to something that is more competitive and then economic to deploy across the world. If we can crack that nut, as I've said many times before, the holy grail in addressing emissions is direct air capture. And the challenge for the industry is to find ways to do that more cost effectively. And frankly, we're at the very early stages of the technology and the technology development. So whether we're successful or somebody else is successful, I feel like this is an area worth exploring. And I think our technology companies have got some great ideas, know how to scale things, know how to optimize not only materials but processes and bringing all that together to see if we can't make a step change here is the objective. And it's too early to judge how successful we'll be, but I certainly feel like we've got the capabilities and should be working hard to try to make advances here.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Great. Looking forward to your updates in the space there. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet. Thank you.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thanks, everybody, for joining our call today and for the questions you asked. We'll post a transcript of the Q&A session on our investor website later this week or early next week. Have a nice weekend everybody. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator to conclude our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I want to start with the theme of the quarter, which frankly, has been a theme of the year, excellence in execution. Whether it's operating our facilities, building projects, deploying technologies, trading, marketing, sales, supply chain, or any of our other activities, the men and women of ExxonMobil are setting and holding themselves to very high standards as they execute their responsibilities. Their hard work and commitment drove the strong results we reported today and are the foundation of our success. At the end of the day, it's all about our people. They make the difference and are delivering industry-leading results. And nothing is more important than the safety of our people. Keeping them safe requires intense focus and relentless discipline, 24 hours a day, every single day. For many years we've outperformed industry benchmarks for workplace safety. Over the last several years we've been implementing improved systems for managing both personnel and process safety, leveraging best practices from across our company and industry, our own and others. These efforts are paying off with continued improvements in the number and severity of incidents. The discipline needed to consistently deliver industry-leading safety performance manifests itself in all our work. We see it in our project teams, who are delivering large capital projects at top-quintile performance on cost and schedule. We see it in the reliability of our operations, where we achieved record performance in both the upstream and refining. We see it in our environmental performance, where we set several new records. And we see it in the successful management of the transformational re-organizations we've made over the last several years. Results are clear. By any measure, 2023 was an outstanding year. We delivered $36 billion of earnings, strong cash flows, and a 15% return on capital employed. Our strategy, introduced in 2018, coupled with consistently strong execution, is delivering results that lead industry across a range of metrics, including earnings and cash flow growth, total shareholder distributions, and total shareholder returns since 2019, the baseline year of our plans. On a constant-price basis, we more than doubled earnings in 2023 versus 2019, demonstrating the improved earnings power of the company. The growth in profitability reflects significant progress in high-grading our portfolio of assets through advantaged projects, divestment of less strategic operations, and significant cost reductions. During the year, our divestments generated more than $4 billion of cash proceeds. And we also announced two value-accretive acquisitions. Denbury, which closed in November, provides opportunities to profitably accelerate our Low Carbon Solutions business with a compelling, end-to-end, customer decarbonization offer. Pioneer, which is expected to close in the second quarter, will further differentiate our advantaged Upstream portfolio. The synergies will create significant shareholder value and accelerate Pioneer's net zero ambitions by 15 years, to 2035. In 2023, we made significant advances in a number of innovative solutions. We entered the lithium business, where we see an opportunity to supply approximately 1 million electric vehicles per year by 2030 with economically advantaged production that has a much smaller environmental impact than today's supply. In the carbon capture and storage space, we recently completed the construction of a pilot plant to further develop a unique, proprietary technology, which has the potential to significantly lower the cost of direct air capture. We also launched Proxxima, a thermoset resin with a high value in use for coatings, infrastructure, automotive parts, and wind power, made from low value components used in gasoline. We also took a further step in reducing cost, leveraging scale and improving effectiveness with the formation of three new centralized organizations, Global Supply, Trading, and Global Business Solutions. This change provides additional opportunities to grow deep expertise across a broad portfolio of critical business capabilities. Today, we're convinced that no other company can match the depth and breadth of development opportunities that ExxonMobil offers. It's no surprise that for the 11th year in a row, we were recognized as the most attractive US employer in the industry for engineering students. This is another key competitive advantage. Our plan for 2024 remains anchored in our existing strategy, building on world-class execution and the performance we delivered last year. We set a high bar for ourselves across all aspects of the business, from safety to operational excellence to financial performance, and have confidence in our team's ability to consistently deliver. For 2024, we expect to invest $23 billion to $25 billion to grow our portfolio of advantaged, low-cost of supply assets, further shift our product mix towards higher value, higher margin performance products, and reduce emissions, both our own and others. Our plan also continues to structurally reduce costs to achieve $15 billion in structural cost savings through 2027. We have opportunities to enhance supply chain efficiency, further improve maintenance and turnarounds, modernize data management, and simplify business processes. In Low Carbon Solutions, we'll continue the integration of Denbury and look to add additional customers to our US Gulf Coast network. As we noted during the Corporate Plan update in December, we're now pursuing more than $20 billion of lower emissions opportunities, evenly split between reducing our own emissions and reducing third-party emissions. Overall, our portfolio of low carbon investments is expected to generate returns of approximately 15%. Our Upstream portfolio will be further transformed when we close on the transaction with Pioneer. By combining the capabilities of our two companies and leveraging the advances we've made in technology, we expect to recover more resource, more efficiently, with lower emissions. We'll provide more detail about this compelling combination at our Spotlight event following the close. Our results in 2023 once again demonstrated the strength of our strategy. As I reflect on the past year, I have tremendous pride in what our people accomplished and a strong level of confidence in our continued ability to lead in the years ahead. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Now, I'll turn it back to Jennifer. Sure. Thanks, Neil. Good to hear from you again. Maybe just start with a little bit of perspective. If you think about where we have been driving efficiencies and what lies behind the improvements in structural cost. We've made tremendous changes in the organization and we've been doing that each successive year, sequenced with respect to what needs to come first, second, and third to make sure that we can effectively manage that. We're still in the early stages of taking advantage of all the changes that we've made going back in time with our global technology organization, with our product solutions organization that frankly brought refining together with our marketing and then together with chemical. So a lot of restructuring, a lot of opportunities, and all the organizations see a path to significantly improved effectiveness in executing the business and, to your point, a significant path to efficiencies. On top of that, we just launched our global supply chain organization. We just launched our global business solutions organization and our trading organization. So they're early in their process, and all of them see significant opportunities for efficiency. So I would say $9.7 billion is a reflection of the hard work coming from the reorganizations that we've done and we're early in that and then we've got additional reorganizations to take advantage of. That $15 billion that you referred to is not a target, it is in our plans and the plans reflect what the organizations are working on. So what are some of the areas? We've seen a lot of benefit today by a centralized approach to enhancing our maintenance and our turnaround processes. We've taken a lot of cost out with respect to that. We see an opportunity to bring further cost reductions there. The supply chain organization brings a huge opportunity. In the past, we had very fragmented supply chain organizations across all of our businesses. We've now consolidated all that. We see a lot of opportunities to bring together our data and our processes and harmonize those and do those consistently across all of the organization. And then a lot of continuing optimization within the base business, taking advantage of the new construct and learning from one another, that's a huge part of the go-forward reduction. So I would just tie all that to the ongoing change and the fact that we now have a good line of sight across all of our organizations around the best way to do things and the most efficient ways to do things. I'll hand it over to Kathy if there's anything to add to that. Thank you, Neil. Yeah, good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the back end of your question around the CapEx. I mean, it should be clear, hopefully it's clear, we've provided guidance in a range in CapEx to give you a perspective of when we start the year based on the plans that we put together the previous year where we think we're going to end up and spend across the year. Obviously as we're going through the business, each of the businesses are clear on their objective to find value creative opportunities and to capture those as quickly as possible. So we've got an ongoing process. If we see an opportunity that we weren't aware of at the time of putting together the plan, we're not constraining our activities based on some artificial number or the guidance that we've put out. We're very focused on making sure that it's going to be an effective use of capital, that we can efficiently execute what's required for that capital, and then that there's value behind it and there's an advantage in it. So that's how we're managing. What we talked about in the release with respect to our CapEx in 2023 reflects just that, incremental optimizations as we're going through the year. And my view is we'll continue to do that as we go forward into the plan years. Obviously, we've given you some guidance that we believe reflect where we'll end up. But as we work the opportunities, we're very focused on that. I think, the short term, what we've done with Guyana, you're seeing today in Payara, where we brought that online. And frankly, in January, well ahead of our plans, reached nameplate capacity. And part of that was around the optimization of the drilling and making sure that we had what we needed to bring that up quickly. In terms of the broader objective to get to 2027, I mean we're on that plan and we're actually delivering the value that we laid out in 2018. So I feel really good about the progress we've made. We noted in the release that if you look at just from 2019, the year before the pandemic, the advances that we've made in the business, on a flat price, take margin, take price out of it, we've doubled the earnings capacity of the corporation from 2019 to 2023. We've grown earnings at compounded annual basis by 40%, greater than 40%. We've grown cash flow from operations almost 20%, greater than 15%. So I think significant progress we've demonstrated at the work that we're doing, projects that we've put in place, the reorganizations that we've executed, the cost that we're cutting out of the business are all driving us towards this improved valuation and frankly the plans we have going forward are going to continue to do that. So the targets that we've laid out, what we communicated in our December company plan release, basically those are plans and we feel that we're right on track if not slightly ahead of delivering on those. Kathy, anything to add to that? Well if you think about -- sure, and good morning, Devin. If you think about the complexity of what the organizations are dealing with and in particular the upstream that as we -- as you go through the course of the year, and they're drilling, and they're collecting data, and we're seeing the production, we've got a real-time optimization loop that takes the experience that we've had and builds it back into our go-forward plan. So it is a very dynamic process. And we've got, to Kathy's point, at lot of -- we're using a lot of technology to make sure that we're learning from all the data that we're collecting as we go and that we're adjusting our plans to optimize value. I would tell you, the organization understands it has an obligation to drive value and to find the value opportunities and to make sure that when we decide to spend money that we know that spend is going to be productive spend and that we're going to be efficient in executing that spend. And beyond that, they're not constrained. If they find that we're going to hit a constraint or we're going to hit something that's not incorporated in the plans, we have a conversation about that. So I would tell you it is a very well controlled process. Your point about capital coming forward in the fourth quarter, I would tell you the decisions that we made that led to going a little above the guidance weren't made in the fourth quarter. Those were made as we were going through the year with the recognition that if we took some of the steps as we were going through the year, that as we got to the end of the year, those numbers would grow potentially but up on -- well, slightly above the guidance. And we made the decisions as we were going. And it's a very dynamic process. So I think that's how I would think about it, that we're going to continue doing that going forward. Obviously, the Permian, we continue to learn with the technologies that we're bringing in there, the techniques that we keep evolving. So my expectation is we'll continue to adjust as we go to maximize the value of the production and what we're learning through the technologies that we're deploying. And then with Guyana, I mean don't underestimate the complexity of these reservoirs and the challenges the organization has. So as they're drilling and gaining information, we're optimizing that as we go as well. And if we see an opportunity to advance the development and bring it forward and bring [NPV] (ph) with that, we'll take that. And so I would just tell you, it's hard to predict because what are you going to learn? I mean, if we knew that now, it wouldn't be a learning. We'd know it. It would be built into the plan. So it's hard to really predict the learning piece of it. Anything to add, Kathy? Yeah, good morning, John. Thanks for the question. I think, just maybe step back and talk a little bit about the process. Organization does its best to design the projects for the capacities that we want to deliver and then as they hand the cap, the projects group hands that off to the operating group. They're obviously, as they begin operation testing to see where we are with respect to constraints and every -- the advantage that we have here is that we've tried to stick to some consistent design. This design [won't build many] (ph) concept, we've tried to the extent possible, maintain consistency from boat to boat. Obviously, as the subsurface and the complexity of the developments change, we have to make adjustments. So it's not quite a cookie cutter approach, but we tried to maintain a level of consistency. One, because that keeps your capital cost down. But two, it allows us to take the learnings from the previous boats and apply it to the one we just started up, and advance things faster to do things quicker. And a great example for Prosperity is how quickly we managed to bring that unit up and get flaring down and get to nameplate capacity. That was -- we did that essentially at record times, which is a reflection of the fact that the organization as they've been bringing these units -- these production units on line that they're learning and then taking those learnings and forwarding it to the next post. So my expectation is you'll see us move faster and faster as we go. Difficult to predict exactly what that ramp up looks like or the step changes if you will because it'll be a function of what they bring into -- what the next constraint that they overcome to make sure that we can continue to run those facilities safely within all the operating limits but at the same time maximize their value. And so I would say take the previous ramp ups as a basis and then our expectation is the organization will find ways to do it even better. Yeah, good morning, Bob. I would just say you have oversimplified it. I would start with every year is a year of execution. And I think it's the fact that we have managed maybe in comparison to some of our peers to make it look easy and have executed, I think, at a high level. Make no mistake, the organization, that is a -- continues to be a real challenge across all of our operations. And I think the men and women of ExxonMobil have done an outstanding job of consistently executing to a very high standard, as I said in my prepared remarks. So I don't want to take anything away from that and I also don't want to suggest that we, for a minute, take that for granted or take our eye off of that ball. And so that's job number one. And even in bringing these projects online, that takes a tremendous amount of focus and discipline from an execution standpoint. So that is job one. And then obviously the strategy, that is also an emphasis every year. It's just, as we've always talked about, it's really a function of can we find the right opportunities, the right equation that brings value to our shareholders. And if it's M&A, it's got to be one plus one has to equal three or more. If it's a project, it's got to be advantageous, it's got to position ourselves on the very far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. And so we've laid out what we know of and what we see ahead of us, certainly in the capital standpoint, but as the organization continues to execute and continues to look for ways to translate the strategy into bottom line value, we find new opportunities and then we don't hesitate to go after those if they meet our criteria with respect to the advantages and they are within our ability to effectively execute. So I wouldn't say 2024 there's any different emphasis than there was in 2023. The project piece of it, frankly that's the way the projects have been developed and kind of the work that's required to deliver those has led to that 2024 year of execution. But I wouldn't read more into that than just the scheduling of the projects. You bet. Thank you, Bob. Yeah, sure. I think the Denbury acquisition, just maybe a slight update on that first is, we've closed it, we've been going through the integration process and frankly continue to be very pleased with what we see as the opportunities to integrate that with the work we're doing around our Low Carbon Solutions business in carbon capture. So we see huge potential in terms of linking together all the opportunities to reduce emissions, high concentration emissions along the US Gulf Coast and along that pipeline system. So the team's doing a lot of work around developing the business there, a lot of work with potential customers around how we can help capture their emissions, and a lot of work around the operations and improving and growing the capacity of that pipeline. So all that's ongoing. My expectation is, with time, when we -- as we negotiate the opportunities with customers, we'll see more and more deals that bring emissions into that pipeline. That's certainly the plan. But I would tell you we're very focused on building this business for the long term. If you think about what we're trying to do there with respect to addressing the risk of climate change and significantly reducing emissions for third parties, that's a business that doesn't exist today anywhere in the world. We're trying to make sure that as the first mover here that we establish a very strong foundation for business that we expect to be around for decades to come. And so my guidance to the team is while we want to move quickly to reduce emissions and to get customers and to grow the volume of emissions we're reducing, we don't want to do that and sacrifice the value opportunity here. And so we're striking that balance. And I think what you'll see happen is, we'll bring on customers and grow that business in a way that is value-accretive and generates the returns that we need for the capital in that business. You bet. Yeah, I'll let Kathy address the cashflow thing. And I'll just say from a gas realization standpoint, I don't think there's anything unique in terms of what was realized as we went through the quarter. Obviously, we've been growing our trading business and that is going to manifest itself and our results, we're going to see that in our energy business, we're going to see that in our gas businesses. So that will continue to kind of, and as volatility changes and opportunities in the market change, we'll see that kind of ebb and flow. But we expect to see with time, a continued growth, structural improvement in the earnings with the work that we're doing in the trading space. And then I think quarter-on-quarter we're going to see changes in mix as we move across the quarters. And so we'll see some variation there. But I wouldn't put anything structurally other than the trading work that we've been doing and to our realizations. And I'll hand it to Kathy for any other comments on that and the cash flow. Good morning, Sam. I would -- I guess I'd take exception to the characterization that you've laid out there. It's not a function of the organization throwing additional nickels and dimes. We have pretty focused work programs to drive value here and frankly any discussion about spending additional money or making additional investments above and beyond what we've planned for has to come to the management committee. And so we've got pretty tight controls around making sure we understand what's the value proposition, how unique is the value proposition. This is not something we just turn loose to the organization and they start throwing on money as and when they see the opportunities to do that. So that's I think, the characterization that it's hard to hang on to this. I would think -- I would point to the success that we've had to date where we've delivered what is a very accretive advantaged set of capital projects. I think our track record demonstrates that we are not about going after volume or going after marginal investment opportunities. These things have to be unique. The hurdle to get into the capital plan is pretty high. We have -- if you look across the industry, we have a clear understanding of cost of supply. We know where we sit on the cost of supply curve. We know as new projects or opportunities come forward, we look at those in terms of where they sit from a competitive standpoint. They have to have a structural advantage. They have to be robust and resilient to the bottom of cycle conditions. If you lay all those conditions on, it's a fairly tight funnel that people have to get their spend through. And that doesn't change. That has not changed. And so I would just say, if we spend additional money, that money is going to deliver more than what was in the base plan frankly because it's on the margin. And I'll come back to, at the end of the day, we're not judging ourselves by basing -- by hitting some number that we've, or guidance that we've given from a year ago. We're judging ourselves on the ability to generate advantaged projects. And again, I just point you to the results that we are delivering. To grow earnings on a compounded basis at twice what the nearest competitor has done, or to grow cash flow from operations at twice what the next nearest competitor has done, doesn't come from investing in things that don't have the advantage that I just talked about. So I think our track record and the results that we're delivering demonstrate that the approach that we've taken here is working, and we're not going to vary off of that approach. Sure. Good morning, Jason. Yeah, I think I would concur with your characterization of 2023 as being kind of at the bottom of the trough. It was definitely a challenging year, well below, I think, the bottoms of previous cycles. But I would say that, and we're quite proud of the fact that the investments that we've brought on were earnings and cash positive in the bottom of the cycle, which frankly is exactly in line with -- I was just talking about the strategy that we have and the criteria that we require our projects that they have to be robust to bottom of the cycle conditions. And in the chemical business, we definitely demonstrated that, that the projects -- the new projects that we've brought on, that have some run time in them, are earnings and cash positive, even in these very challenging conditions. So I think like many others in the chemical industry, we'd like to see us come out of the trough and when we do, our expectation is the capital that we've brought on will obviously be performing even better with better margins. I would say as well with respect to turning points, we have seen some -- we certainly saw in the fourth quarter some slight improvements. There's still a lot of capacity that's come on out there. We still see a reasonably good growth, particularly for ExxonMobil in our performance product category. We have set some pretty aggressive targets to grow our high performance, high value chemical products and we're seeing that happen. So we feel really good about the pipeline and the development of our sales. And then the question is when does the broader industry turn and you start to see margins improve? My expectation is 2024 might be marginally better than 2023, but we're not expecting significant change in the vector, but more of a gradual one as we work our way through all the supply that's come on in the recent years and some of the supply will come on in 2024 and 2025. So I think it will be a gradual recovery but frankly one that we feel very comfortable with based on the advantages that we have with our capacity, the advantages that we have with our footprint, and the flexibility we have to optimize on feed and products. So we're positioned for this kind of market. I think the results demonstrate that. And we're going to ride it and see where the market goes. Good morning. Yeah, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'll give you a perspective and then let Kathy build on that. And maybe just to go back in time a little bit, we talked about the trading opportunity within ExxonMobil for quite some time. I think there's some skepticism out there as to whether we could actually build that business. But the foundation of our trading operations is a function of the global footprint that we have, the span of the businesses that we have, the integrated nature of the businesses that we have that we felt like gave us a physical footprint and presence in markets all around the world to effectively trade on and to build a business from that footprint and obviously the perspectives and insights that come with operating that footprint in those mix of businesses. And that, I would say as we've grown our trading capability on that premise, optimizing our assets, building on our assets, that it has proven to be very effective, that that strategy is bearing out and that we see continued opportunity to grow that. And I think as we've talked about here, we were going to take a very measured approach and we weren't in a hurry, we weren't going to rush through this, we were going to make sure that what we do is structurally sound that we're not -- and that we're managing the risk as well as capturing the rewards and we've been doing that. So 2023 I think was off of the highs we saw in 2022 because of where the market is at, but still reflected, I think, very solid contributions based on the capabilities of the organization that we have been building. And we have got more to do there. My expectation is that you will see improved trading results embedded in our businesses because frankly those -- that trading organization's objective is to enhance the value of the businesses. We don't want a trading organization that's competing against the base business. We want a trading organization that's working with the base business to optimize value for the corporation. And they're doing that and those earnings accrue to the businesses that they're trading on behalf of. But I'm very pleased with what we saw in 2023. Obviously, the market and volatility is going to have a function -- will function heavily or play a heavy function year in year in terms of what we actually deliver. But structurally, we've got a really sound base that we're growing and I think we're going to continue to see improvement in that space. Kathy, anything to add? Yeah, well, thanks for the question. No, I would just tell you there's -- we're not going to run the business to appease an external member out there. I think the way we look at it is, can we find -- it comes back to every dollar that we choose to invest and spend. Do we see a return? Are we convinced that we're effectively spending that money and we're spending it efficiently? That's the criteria that we're using. That's the plans that we've built. We expect to grow our volumes in 2024 to about 650 Kbd. And then we're going to continue that growth through to the targets that we've laid out in 2027 of about a million barrels a day -- close to a million barrels a day. So that's the plan that we have. We're executing to that plan. And as we've said before, year-on-year, it's not straight ratable growth. It'll be lumpy growth. But over time, it'll average about 13%. And we haven't seen anything to date that would say that's going to change. Obviously as we bring Pioneer into the fold, we'll bring their production in and look to kind of optimize across that portfolio that both companies have. And as we've said before, that once we close on that, we'll come back out and have a spotlight where we share what the implications of bringing these two companies together and the impact on our Permian production. You bet. Sure. Yeah, I'm happy to do that. And you remember correctly, we did say we were going to build some more DUCs. And I would think about that. And you used the right word, inventory, like any inventory that we have in the business, which is, if you're optimizing what is a pretty complex system of drilling and fracking and managing simultaneous ops and how you schedule all that and how it interfaces with each other and the planning piece of it, you want to have a little bit of inventory that allows you to continue at a pace and manage around some of the complexities and potential conflicts that you have in developing the acreage. And you'll recall that what we are doing in the Permian, in the Delaware in particular, is this manufacturing approach where we're laying out these spines and then executing like a manufacturing organization down that. So it is a very paced and continuum of work and production. So there are constraints that you hit as you're doing that consistently across all that acreage and having some DUCs available to us allows us to when we run into an issue with what we're doing in the immediate vicinity, we have some other opportunities to continue the production. So we use it like any other inventory. Now, obviously the trick is to get that inventory level right. You don't want a bunch of capital sitting there that isn't earning its return. This, we think we've got to an optimized level that allows us to keep a very efficient, I'd say, manufacturing process running versus a focus on production and production process. You bet. Yeah, sure. I think, and you rightly so pointed out the proprietary nature, so I will limit some of the details of what we're talking about there, but maybe just from a broader contact standpoint, we're convinced that carbon capture is going to play a really important role in helping society meet its ambitions to get to net zero or to make certainly significant reductions in carbon emissions. I think it makes a lot of sense to, rather than tear up and throw away the existing infrastructure and the industries that we have in place that are intensive energy users, that we find a way to deal with the problem, which is the emissions. So I think carbon capture plays a role there. The technology that we have today, frankly, wasn't developed for this application. It has a use and can be deployed today for high concentration streams. But as you move down the emissions profile and get to lower and lower concentrations of CO2 streams, the existing technology is challenged. And so it becomes very expensive for every ton of carbon that you reduce. And so the challenge is use the existing technology today for these high concentration streams where you can make the economics work, but then find a lower cost method to deploy for these less concentrated streams that still make it economic. So that's been the challenge that we're working on, recognizing that the existing technology was designed for a different purpose. We need a new technology here and we're trying to take advantage of material science development, things have happened with materials, with nanostructures. There's a lot of advances in technology since the existing technology was developed. And so there's a question of how can we better capture CO2 by using advances in the existing technology. We think we've come up with an opportunity to potentially do that, but it's early days like all these technology developments. And so we built a pilot plant and we'll see and test out some of these new capabilities and test the cost effectiveness of capture. I'd say our first step, we're looking to get about a cost reduction of about half. But I would tell you that's still not enough. But if we can see a significant step change in that cost or path to that cost reduction, that gives us hope that we can then continue to advance that and get it back -- get it down to something that is more competitive and then economic to deploy across the world. If we can crack that nut, as I've said many times before, the holy grail in addressing emissions is direct air capture. And the challenge for the industry is to find ways to do that more cost effectively. And frankly, we're at the very early stages of the technology and the technology development. So whether we're successful or somebody else is successful, I feel like this is an area worth exploring. And I think our technology companies have got some great ideas, know how to scale things, know how to optimize not only materials but processes and bringing all that together to see if we can't make a step change here is the objective. And it's too early to judge how successful we'll be, but I certainly feel like we've got the capabilities and should be working hard to try to make advances here. You bet. Thank you."

            "name": "Kathy Mikells",
            "content": "The only other thing I would add is how we're looking to leverage technology to both drive incremental efficiency but as importantly to drive effectiveness. So things like how we use artificial intelligence and chat box in our customer care centers, right, which gives our customers better service. And obviously, that drives efficiency for the company. How we use predictive analytics and things like driving maintenance turnarounds to top kind of quintile type performance or similarly how we use those predictive analytics in our drilling and fracking centralized operation here in Houston. So bringing together our information technology organization with our engineering and research organization will just further enhance, I think, how overall we as a technology company fundamentally try to use technology to both drive efficiency but obviously to drive value in the business. Yeah, I mean, Doug, I'll just try to grind kind of back to those numbers a little bit more just so you understand that on an earnings basis, we actually more than doubled earnings on again that constant price basis that we used in our corporate plan which Darren is referring to in the numbers that he just mentioned. So I would absolutely say we are ahead of our plan in terms of what it is that we're achieving. And it's that earnings improvement that is flowing through to cash flow. And so as you think about cash flow, our earnings expectation in the corporate plan in terms of doubling it out to 2027, it's well ahead of doubling it. And then those earnings just flow through to the cash flow growth. So I would describe us as being ahead of plan in terms of where we stand today and feeling very good about the future. I'd just say if you look at the specifics of what we delivered as a result of actually spending a little bit more on CapEx, I think you see that just goes hand in hand to how we drove value for shareholders. So in the Permian, we had guided to 600,000 kind of oil equivalent barrels, we came in at 620,000. In Guyana, we had said 380,000, we came in at 390,000 right? And you think about where we're at in Guyana today and we've got Prosperity, the third boat which is in the Payara development already up to nameplate capacity as we stand here today. And that's because we made the decision to drill more wells to ensure that we could get that boat up to capacity as quickly as possible and our organization absolutely delivered on that. So those were the right economic decisions that drove value for our shareholders. And then if you don't mind, I'm just going to add because I know everybody is now going to be modeling what Guyana is going to look like for the year. So this is just a reminder that at some point in the second half we're working on the gas to energy project, right, and laying the pipeline down to bring that gas from Liza 1 and Liza 2 onshore, to basically kind of plug it into the power plant that ultimately will drive down costs for consumers in Guyana. And we will be taking Liza 1 and Liza 2 offline for a period of time as we kind of hook them up to that pipeline. So that's just a reminder that we'll have a little bit of downtime at some point in the second half. Yep. And so I'll just speak specifically to cash flow from operations and I think you're referencing the quarter but I'm happy to talk about the quarter and the year. Our cash flow from operations, if you look at the quarter was $13.7 billion. If you exclude working capital, we would have been at $16.9 billion. You're mentioning a beat relative to the street, and so was there anything unusual going on? As I look at people's models, I think sometimes they struggle to get depreciation and amortization right, so that's the only thing I'm going to speak to. And when we have a quarter where we're taking impairments, then we get an increase kind of in terms of a non-cash add back that flows through to cash flow from operations and we obviously took an impairment in the quarter. So that's my best guess as to anything that might be nuanced. Otherwise, no, nothing particularly unusual going on. And then I'd just add one more comment, and that is, we almost take for granted how many projects we've actually been able to pull forward and deliver either on time or ahead of time. And Payara is a great example of that. It was originally targeted to actually start up in 2024 and we were able to pull it forward. We were then able to pull forward incremental well drilling in order to get that FPSO up to operating nameplate capacity in an extraordinarily short amount of time. I'd say this is one of the areas that really differentiates ExxonMobil from other companies. Our top -- really top performance and execution and pulling projects forward is always a positive economic decision, right, because we're going to end up then getting the benefit of the profits from those projects sooner or later. So very much a decision that's aligned with driving value, which is what sits behind all of our decision making. Yeah, the only other thing that I'd add to that is if you looked at our trading results on a year-on-year basis, in upstream we were lapping kind of a big mark-to-market gain in 2022, right? So that impacted our results. And I've mentioned time and time again that quarterly results, especially as a result of that movement in mark-to-market, will kind of ebb and flow. And sometimes we get price timing nuances in the quarter. As we came to the end of this year, those price timing nuances that we saw in the third quarter had fully unwound by the fourth quarter. So I think we start the year overall in a pretty good place. No, we don't disclose that. And I think actually all our peers have a pretty high sensitivity to just -- competitive sensitivity in terms of disclosing that number. But I think Darren put overall things into a good context, which is last year was record earnings for the company and it was record trading earnings. And so we had a strong result this year in trading, but it was down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And then I mentioned specifically in upstream that we were lapping favorability in terms of mark-to-market favorable gain in 2022."

I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please proceed, ma\u2019am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning everyone. Welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. We appreciate your joining the call today. I\u2019m Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. I\u2019m joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the third quarter earnings release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from his presentation, then we\u2019ll take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcements regarding Pioneer Natural Resources and Denbury, we\u2019ve included additional information on Slide 2 related to comments or information included in today\u2019s presentation. Please be aware that this presentation is not intended to be a solicitation of any vote for approval. During today\u2019s presentation, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Now please turn to Slide 4 for Darren\u2019s opening remarks.\nDarren Woods: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered another robust quarter of earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns, reflecting our ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained industry-leading performance. We reported $9.1 billion of earnings, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to last quarter.  While the market provided a bit of tailwind, our success was enabled by the continued strength of our operational performance, which reflects the hard work of our people across the company. Whether it\u2019s continuing to drive efficiency in maintenance and turnarounds, running at high throughputs and utilization rates, or delivering big projects at first quintile cost and schedule, the excellent work of our people underpins our results and sustains our drive to deliver industry-leading performance in everything we do. The work is fundamentally strengthening the underlying earnings power of the company, establishing a strong foundation to deliver industry-leading results in any price environment.  Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share the success of the company with our shareholders. This morning, we were pleased to announce a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share. This year is our 41st consecutive year of annual dividend increases, a record that we\u2019re proud of and that we know our investors value highly. We continue to strengthen our portfolio of businesses by investing in advantaged high return opportunities while divesting businesses that are no longer a strategic fit. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our Thailand refinery, bringing our year-to-date cash proceeds from asset sales to more than $3 billion. We followed this in October with the close of the refinery sale in Italy. Recently announced acquisitions are great examples of the and equation, meeting the world\u2019s needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions. Acquiring Denbury strengthens our position to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries, which today have limited practical options. We see the potential to drive strong returns with the capacity to reduce the nation\u2019s carbon emissions by 100 million tons per year - that\u2019s 20 times our current CO2 off-take agreements with CF Industries, Linde and Nucor, which by themselves could reduce CO2 emissions by an amount equivalent to replacing two million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles currently on U.S. roads. We expect to close the transaction in early November with Denbury shareholders scheduled to vote next week. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in another all-stock transaction. This combination will further strengthen our already advantaged upstream portfolio and create significant value for the shareholders of both companies. Together, we will recover more resource more efficiently and with a lower environmental impact. We plan to accelerate Pioneer\u2019s Permian net zero ambition by 15 years and fully leverage their advances in water recycling. This deal is a win any way you look at it - good for our shareholders, good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for U.S. energy security. Neil will say more about the benefits of the transaction in a few moments. We\u2019re also continuing to drive profitable growth organically. In energy products, we achieved the highest third quarter refinery throughput on record, driven by our Beaumont refinery expansion. At a time of strong demand and low inventories, this project is providing 250,000 barrels per day of much needed new capacity to the market.  In addition, we recently started up our Baytown chemical expansion, which grows volume and improves mix. It provides 750,000 tons per year of new performance chemical capacity, including 350,000 tons of linear alpha olefins, marking our entry into this growing market.  We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance with earnings of $9.1 billion and cash flow from operations of $16 billion. These results reflect the structural earnings improvements we\u2019ve delivered over the past several years as we\u2019ve improved our mix of assets and driven significant structural cost reductions, while maintaining our focus on industry-leading safety and reliability. We have lowered our structural costs by $9 billion since 2019, meeting our plan, and expect to deliver additional savings in the fourth quarter. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our base operations, including enhancing our maintenance and turnaround processes, strengthening our digital capabilities, and optimizing our supply chain. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with our full year guidance.  Capex investments of $18.6 billion year-to-date are on plan. We expect 2023 capex to finish the year at the top end of our guidance range as we continue to invest in high return advantaged projects, our top priority for creating long term shareholder value. As always, we remain focused on sharing the company\u2019s success with our shareholders. We delivered $8.1 billion in shareholder distributions in the third quarter, $3.7 billion in dividends, and $4.4 billion in share repurchases.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Neil.\nNeil Chapman: Thanks Darren. Good morning everyone.  As we said with you recently, Pioneer is arguably the best Permian pure play company with the largest undeveloped Tier 1 inventory in the Midland basin. Pioneer\u2019s premier asset base is matched by the quality of its workforce. Its employees are innovative and hard working and possess a deep knowledge of unconventional operations in the Permian. When you combine these attributes with our technology and industry-leading operational capabilities, we\u2019re confident we can unlock far more value together than either of us could do alone. We expect synergies of approximately $1 billion before tax annually, beginning in the second year post closing, and an average of about $2 billion per year over the next decade driving double-digit returns. This transaction not only strengthens our current position but it also transforms our portfolio, increasing our exposure to short cycle low cost to supply liquids in the United States. Based on our initial assessment, we expect our combined Permian production to increase to approximately 2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by the end of 2027. Downstream, this merger also increases the integration between high value light Permian crude and our premier refinery and chemical footprint on the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Finally, we\u2019ve said many times that we\u2019re working to solve the end equation, providing the energy and products society needs and reducing emissions, both ours and others. This transaction reflects both parts of our commitment. We will increase our Permian production with plans to accelerate Pioneer\u2019s net zero plan to 2035 from 2050, and decrease our combined Permian emissions.  With that, I\u2019ll pass it to Jennifer.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you Neil.  We have two quick announcements to share with you. First, please mark your calendars for our annual corporate plan update scheduled for Wednesday, December 6 at 9:00 am Central time. [Indiscernible] and Kathy are going to provide formal remarks and take live questions from our sell-side analysts [indiscernible]. Second, please keep an eye out for our 2024 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in mid-December. With that, we\u2019re going to begin our Q&A session. Please note we continue to ask analysts to limit yourselves to one question as a courtesy to others; however, please remain on the line in case we need any clarifications.  Operator, please bring us the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you Ms. Driscoll. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning and thanks for the update. The first question for me is on the Permian here. Slides 17 to 19 are interesting and incremental. I was wondering if you could take a moment to walk us through it. Just in the context of the investor feedback we\u2019ve gotten around the transaction, folks are looking for a little more clarity on the top line synergies that are going to come from better productivity. Thank you.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, good morning Neil. You know, what we outlined in the slide with the earnings release is really the basis of what I\u2019d always describe as real, quantifiable synergies that have created the deal space for this transaction. These synergies are already demonstrated in our existing operations, either in the Delaware of the Midland. It does not include the pipeline of new technologies that are either in the early stages of deployment or close to deployment. By applying what we\u2019ve already demonstrated, we\u2019re confident we can recover an additional 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels, more than either Pioneer or industry could have demonstrated with their existing performance. In the charts, we highlight two areas. One, industry\u2019s move to cube development. We\u2019ve moved to cube development to get the higher net present value. We were the pioneer in that, and that\u2019s obviously to avoid the parent-child impact. The top chart on there shows that we\u2019ve been drilling cube since 2020 100% in the Midland, and you can see that over the period, Pioneer has moved to 100% cubes as well. In 2022, when we were both developing 100% cubes, you can see we\u2019ve got equivalent recovery rates, but we\u2019re at notably lower quality acreage, lower quality resource, so equivalent recovery at lower quality resource, and when we look at truly comparable acreage, and that\u2019s really, really important because generalizations can lead to misleading results. In the bottom, we talk about adjacent Martin County, where us and Pioneer and one of our other peers are drilling the same 10,000 lateral cubes, you can see we get a 20% higher recovery, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all targeting the same intervals. These are [indiscernible] in similar proportions. What varies and what\u2019s the difference is the stacking and landing zones, and what varies is the optimal wealth spacing that we are delivering, which includes things like vertical orientation. Just one final point on that, Neil, in terms of recovery - it\u2019s not just about how you deliver cubes. When you\u2019ve got better recovery, when you\u2019ve got better capital efficiency, it gives access to economically developing what we would describe as secondary benches. As you\u2019ll recall, like the Wolfcamp C and like the [indiscernible] mill extension, and in addition obviously we have other techniques that we attempt to keep confidential, which gives us this higher level of recovery.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you Neil.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. When you talk about your two million barrel a day initial sort of view of where production from the combined entity can get to in 2027, how do I think about the gating factor? Is that a fixed rig or activity or capex program and the volume is an outcome, or is that a volume target and you\u2019ll adjust activity down as more synergies come through?\nNeil Chapman: Yes Bob, it\u2019s Neil again. I want to be clear - we don\u2019t have a volume target. We have a value target, we have a volume outcome, and that\u2019s really, really important. For our basis, we\u2019ve talked about an outcome being a million barrels a day by the end of 2027 based on our Delaware and Midland Basin. Based on our initial assessments of Pioneer\u2019s plans, obviously we\u2019ve had access to that through the due diligence process, we see that with similar capital spending as Pioneer has today, and you can equate that to a similar number of rigs, we would anticipate that Pioneer\u2019s production under Exxon Mobil and Pioneer\u2019s combined operations would also get to a million barrels a day by the end of 2027.  If you add current production in the Midland Basin from both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil today, it\u2019s already at a million barrels a day. It\u2019s really important, though - volume is an outcome. We\u2019re striving for the value, that\u2019s why we focus on the cube development. But I would say the basis is consistent with existing capital spending that Pioneer are making today. We do anticipate, as I\u2019ve just outlined, improvements in recovery. We do anticipate improvements in capital efficiency based on the synergies that we outlined in the earnings release, but that\u2019s not really built into that outlook of a million barrels a day from the Pioneer operations.\nBob Brackett: Very clear, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDevin McDermott: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to stick with upstream and take advantage of having you on the call here, Neil, and ask about Guyana. The slide noted that production is now coming in ahead of plan for the full year, a little bit better than your full year target, and part of that is the Payara start-up, part of that seems to be debottlenecking. I want to just focus on the debottlenecking opportunity. Could you walk us through how much uplift you\u2019ve realized so far versus nameplate, how much is left, and then the repeatability of this outperformance as we look at the additional FPSOs that are set to start up over the next few years.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, thank you. We\u2019re really encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in Guyana. Let\u2019s just start with the two boats that are in our operation today. Liza 1, or Destiny had a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re consistently running that at about 150,000 barrels a day. Liza 2, Unity was a 220 capacity and we\u2019ve been running that consistently above 240,000 barrels a day, so those two combined are getting close to 400,000 barrels a day, which is quite a bit, and this comes from, I would just say, good operational performance. You look at every aspect of the operations, you tweak them, you push them, and you can get more and more out.  Now, we\u2019re starting up Payara, which is 220,000 barrels a day nameplate capacity. We would hope we would expect to have a similar type of uplift. There is no reason to think that we wouldn\u2019t. We have to start that up--the plan is to start that up in the middle of November, and that would give us a combined nameplate capacity of 560,000 barrels a day, but obviously with the first two boats running more like 400,000 barrels, we expect to be in excess of 600,000 barrels a day of production.  Just to add to that, we\u2019ve got three more boats in the pipeline, as you\u2019re aware. All three of the boats in the pipeline - that\u2019s the Yellowtail, Uaru, and then Whiptail, these are all larger boats, they\u2019re all 250,000 barrels a day. Yellowtail and Uara are in construction. Whiptail, we\u2019ve submitted the development plan to the government, and we would hope and expect to reach FID in 2024 for that, and that will give us a combined nameplate capacity of 1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2027, but that doesn\u2019t include the uplift in performance--production performance that we\u2019ve got on the first two boats. You know, we were certainly--our message to the organization is start it up safely, start it up on time, each boat - that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do on Payara, and once we get settled, we\u2019ll try and follow the same protocols that we\u2019ve done on the first two boats and strive to get maximum production out of the boat, and that\u2019s obviously good for the shareholders, it\u2019s good for the co-ventures, and it\u2019s even better for the country.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would add to Neil\u2019s comment, if you recall, we brought all our projects organization together to make sure that we were leveraging the best capability in terms of development in designing these projects. We\u2019ve also brought together our technology organizations, and the big benefit we have there is we\u2019re now leveraging not only the capacity that was in the upstream in terms of optimization around these facilities, but we\u2019ve decades and decades of experience of people optimizing and running our chemical plants and our refinery facilities to squeeze out and optimize every piece of the production pipeline and make sure that we are at the designed limits of the different equipment. That optimization, which has been kind of the lifeblood of the refining business, given the very narrow margins, has big payoffs when we apply it to the upstream facilities, and so there\u2019s an additional benefit just in terms of leveraging the broader organizational capability, which again has been part of our strategy from the very beginning, is to make sure that we\u2019re bringing to bear the best thinking across the corporation on the most important facilities and projects, and this is certainly one of those.\nDevin McDermott: Great, thanks so much. \nOperator: The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nDoug Leggate: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning everyone.  Darren, forgive me - I\u2019d like also to take advantage of Neil being on the call and follow on with a Guyana question, if I may. Neil, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to frame this question a little bit because a couple of years ago, you talked about if the deeper resource potential proved to be as prolific as the original targets that you had in the area, you could look to double your resource potential from 10 - at that time, you had announced potentially significantly larger. You haven\u2019t updated that resource number in a while. Now, you\u2019ve got Lancentfish, it looks like Fangtooth is in the queue based on your EIS submissions to Guyana, but yet you still talk about production capacity and not production.  My question to you is with capability obviously keeping these boats filled for an extended period of time, what do you ultimately see as the production capacity--sorry, actual production as opposed to capacity trajectory through the end of the decade at this point?\nNeil Chapman: Yes, thanks Doug. There\u2019s probably two parts to that question. One is exploration and then one is production and capacity. Let me just handle exploration first. You know, we\u2019ve had, as you\u2019re aware, three discoveries this year, including Lancetfish-2, which is the most recent one. We continue to integrate those results, both of exploration and appraisal drilling, and we\u2019re going to update that resource base when we see it is a significant change.  Our program of exploration and appraisal continues, and the way I like to frame it is in the southeast corner of the Stabroek Block, we\u2019re continuing to appraise around our discoveries, and that will take a lot of work and a lot of activity. You know we have six drill ships in the basin and they\u2019re both--they\u2019re in development appraisal and exploration drilling.  In addition to all that appraisal drilling that we\u2019re doing in the southeast part of the block, we\u2019re looking for what I would describe as anchor prospects further to the north and further to the west. We continue to look and we\u2019ve probably got order of magnitude three, what I\u2019d call true wildcats or exploration targets, looking for [indiscernible] wells in the next 10 to 12 months, something like that. That can change based on results of either the appraisal or the exploration drilling. You know, we\u2019re going to update when we see something meaningful and when we see something significant. We\u2019ve been very clear that we had six FPSOs in the pipeline - they are firm and I just in one of the previous questions outlined all of those. Indeed, they will have a capacity and you strive to keep them full all the time. As you know, Doug, one of the beauties about the Stabroek Block is the density of the resource and the proximity of these boats, which gives that potential for tie-backs well into the future. But the water cut will increase, as everybody knows, in deepwater, so we constantly look. We like to talk about capacity and we optimize as we go, and we will increase the production versus the nameplate capacity as we go, and so that\u2019s why I think what we can be firm on is we will have six boats by the end of 2027, they will have a nameplate capacity of 1.2, and obviously we will strive to keep them as full of liquids or of oil as we can over that period. I think as we get closer to 2027, obviously we will update those numbers, Doug.\nDoug Leggatte: Appreciate the full answer, Neil. Thanks so much.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, sure. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nStephen Richardson: Great, thank you. We\u2019re going to keep Neil busy this morning. Another one on the Pioneer disclosure - appreciate the incrementals. Neil, I guess it sounds like from your previous comments, the million barrels a day target, that output is still there from the legacy composition and you\u2019re thinking about the additive from Pioneer. Can you talk a little bit about as you integrate the two assets, are you assuming some high grading around some of the higher quality acreage? Do you envision prioritizing more activity on one asset versus the other, or are you still kind of thinking about them as two separates? Also, maybe you can just talk a little bit about assumptions around acreage bolt-ons or any positions as well. Is there a lot of work to do in terms of extending some of this lateral length that you\u2019re talking about? Thanks very much.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, first of all, I would say it\u2019s very early in the process, of course. We\u2019ve done the due diligence, we\u2019re into transition now. I think it\u2019s very important to make the point, Pioneer are a very, very capable organization. They\u2019ve demonstrated that. What we\u2019re really excited about is the combination of these two organizations. Pioneer has a deep, deep understanding of the Midland Basin. As we\u2019ve talked about, this is absolutely in the fairway of Tier 1 quality resource, and Pioneer has done an exceptional job at developing that resource. For our side, we\u2019ve got a whole range of different operating techniques, development plans and technologies, and it\u2019s the integration of those that we\u2019re most excited about. Everything we\u2019re seeing in the initial transition work would suggest all of that is correct. If you just look at the acreage position and you look at where Exxon are--Exxon Mobil are and Pioneer are, obviously it gives an opportunity for both high grading the inventory, and that includes bolt-ons. I have to say that Scott Sheffield and his organization have done an extraordinary job bolting on and increasing their acreage in the basin, and they have a very, very capable land organization, and we look forward to working with those firms. I think it\u2019s a combination that\u2019s going to be most powerful in developing that resource. \nDarren Woods: I\u2019d just add to what Neil said, if you look at what we\u2019ve been doing over the last six years, it\u2019s really been around integrating our organizations, consolidating them, and making sure that we\u2019re concentrating like capabilities into the same organization, and that is paying huge dividends. This is no different. The intent is to fully integrate the Pioneer organization and its people into our business. My expectation is we\u2019ll bring a lot of advantages to their acreage, but at the same time, we expect their people to bring a lot of advantages to other parts of our business, including what we\u2019re doing in the Delaware.  Our whole strategy is really around the value you create by taking experts in areas and getting the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that, so there won\u2019t be a separate approach here. It will be one. I think what you\u2019re seeing today, to Neil\u2019s point, the fact that we\u2019re in very early stage, but as we get together and work through the plans and the development, it will be one seamless integrated organization and plan.\nNeil Chapman: Steve, just one small addition to illustrate that. I\u2019ve talked before that we have a basin-wide remote operations centers in Houston where we control all our operations in Houston - that\u2019s drilling, that\u2019s fracking, the field operations, that\u2019s methane tracking, methane emissions tracking as well from one central control center in Houston. Obviously our plan would be to bring in the whole Pioneer operations in time to have one central organization. What this gives you is it gives you all that competency, all that expertise, applies is to the whole of Midland Delaware Basins from one central control center. \nStephen Richardson: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nRoger Read : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Keeping with the upstream theme here, I\u2019d like to dig into the, I guess call it a slight transition here, the high value-added or high margin liquid barrels, so specifically the comment, 100,000 barrels a day higher versus 2022\u2019s gases declined or been sold, and the liquids have grown. But as you think about the change out to 2027, the growth in Guyana, the growth in the Permian, and we compare that to where you were, say in 2019, how do you think about the total value-added liquid barrels, the impact on margins, the impact on returns? What\u2019s the right way for us to think about the transition of the company over roughly that eight-year period?\nNeil Chapman: Roger, it\u2019s Neil again. Let\u2019s just park the Pioneer acquisition for a moment and just talk about our existing plans as Exxon Mobil. Back in 2018 and 2019, I talked about the strength of our developments that we had in the pipeline, and obviously they were headlined by Guyana and by the Permian. What I said at the time is what you will see is an increase in the percent of liquids in our portfolio and a reduction in the percent of dry gas of the total.  If I outlook to 2027, we will go from something sub-65% liquids to something around 70% liquids in our portfolio in 2027, and 15% or thereabouts of liquefied natural gas, so that takes us up to 85%, I would call liquids index. Obviously 80% of our LNG sales index to Brent or to crude oil. That\u2019s a big transition but it\u2019s driven by the quality of those resources, primarily in the Permian and Guyana, and we\u2019re going to be adding onto that, of course, the programs we have developed we have in LNG in Papua New Guinea and then in Mozambique at the end of the decade. I\u2019d just add one other comment - if you take the liquids and the LNG, which would take us to 85% liquids indexed in 2027, of the gas that remains, 7% of that is associated gas, so in other words gas associated with liquids production. You can see that we\u2019ll be in the order of magnitude of 7% or 8% of dry gas in our portfolio at that time, and that\u2019s pre the Pioneer acquisition. \nDarren Woods: I\u2019d just add to that, Roger, if you just step back and think more conceptually around the strategy and what we\u2019re trying to do, every one of our businesses is focused on moving to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that we remain robust to any period in the commodity cycle and making sure that we\u2019re positioned competitively versus everyone else in the industry. That drive over time to reshape the portfolio continues to move our collective production to the left and to lower cost, and then at the same time adding higher value barrels, we\u2019re lowering cost and increasing revenue, and so that\u2019s where the value game is getting played out. That\u2019s the work that we\u2019ve been doing and that\u2019s the high grading that you\u2019ve seen in the portfolio and the improvements in structural cost. We mentioned at the top of the meeting that we\u2019ve actually achieved the $9 billion in structural cost this quarter, third quarter, so a quarter ahead of what our initial plans were, and we expect to see more in the fourth quarter. As we go forward with the changes that we\u2019ve been making in the organization continuing, we\u2019re going to continue to deliver more structural cost savings.  The whole strategy is around making sure that we have the best portfolio and the most resilient portfolio, so that we can basically be successful irrespective of the commodity price environment that we\u2019re in, and that we\u2019re well positioned versus others in the industry. That is the strategy, and you see that playing out certainly in the upstream, but you also seeing it playing out in the downstream where we\u2019ve been high grading our assets there and playing out in our chemical business, where we continue to bring on units that produce high performance products. That strategy is manifesting itself in each of our businesses. Then I\u2019ll just end on that same philosophy underpins what we\u2019re doing in low carbon solution. As we build out that business and position ourselves for the long term, it\u2019s making sure that every investment that we\u2019re making, every value chain that we\u2019re creating, that Dan and his team have a clear view about where that will sit in the cost supply curve, or you can think of it as the cost of abatement curve, and making sure that we\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry.\nRoger Read: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from John Royall of JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  My question is on the capex. Could you maybe help us bridge the top end that you\u2019re guiding to now for this year versus maybe the midpoint? It\u2019s a tight range, so not super material, but just any color there would be helpful. Then I know you\u2019ll give your update in December, but is there any color you can give us directionally on what you\u2019re thinking of for next year on the legacy business, prior to layering in Pioneer? Just anything on the moving pieces for capex next year would be great, thank you.\nKathryn Mikells: I would say nothing really unusual going on in capex. As you stated, it was a pretty tight range to start with, obviously with a focus on us looking to ensure that we\u2019re investing in advantaged high return projects - that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re delivering, so I would characterize this as updated guidance that\u2019s pretty consistent with our plans, and we can give you a further update when we get to that corporate plan discussion later on in December, but we feel very good about our overall execution.  As Darren mentioned earlier, we\u2019re bringing projects online at a cost and schedule that\u2019s typically within the top quintile, so we feel really good about our capabilities and our execution and our ongoing focus with our highest priority, ensuring that we\u2019re executing great projects with high returns for our shareholders.\nDarren Woods: I might just add to that, as we think about capex, we provide that range because we recognized going into the year that things move around a bit, and as we prosecute a plan that with time, we find additional opportunities as things move around. If you look at where we\u2019re at through the third quarter, we are right on our plan, and so as we move forward, we\u2019re going to continue to do the things that we had planned to do last year, but I would say we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to build on the value proposition. If we see it, we\u2019re going to go after it. We\u2019re not going to constrain ourselves artificially to a guidance range if we find an opportunity set; but to date, things are moving pretty consistent with where we thought we were going to be, and frankly as we look out going forward, continue to see a very consistent set of opportunity sets that we\u2019re going to prosecute. I think the one change that we\u2019ll spend more time talking about in low carbon solutions is as that business matures and we establish, I\u2019d say, an advantaged position, there are a lot of opportunities coming our way, so we\u2019re working our way through those opportunities and making sure that we focus on the highest priority ones, the ones that generate the most value and are competitive in our portfolio. We\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into the plan release.\nJohn Royall: Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nJason Gabelman: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot\u2019s happened in the past few months, but about three months ago, there was a handful of news articles about Exxon\u2019s lithium endeavors. I just wanted to get an update on that. Are you still drilling in the Smackover for lithium, are you exploring potential processing unit there, and how have things trended the past few months? Do you expect that to figure into your growth plans here over the next five years? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Sure, I\u2019ll take that. I think just stepping back and maybe setting the context of what we\u2019re trying to do, I\u2019ll call it in the transition space, and frankly more broadly, go back to the fundamental of what are our key technology competencies and capabilities, and then what businesses lend themselves to those capabilities where we can carve out an advantage and produce the products society needs. Rather than chase what I would say is the current narrative or the current conventional wisdom as to what the world is going to need, it\u2019s focus first on what we can fundamentally contribute and bring an advantage to and therefore generate returns higher than the rest of industry, and then figure out how those advantages apply themselves to what the world needs.  Obviously lithium is an important part of the transition going forward in electrification and the need for batteries and storage of power and energy, and so we\u2019ve looked at that space and clearly with the opportunity at Smackover and the ability to drill, extract the lithium from the brine water and re-inject that, it\u2019s got a much lower environmental impact than the current production process for lithium. It fits very well with our capabilities and on the cost of supply curve, it\u2019s very competitive, so it looks attractive, and the challenge that we\u2019ve been giving to Dan and his team is to develop a business plan where that becomes material with respect to what Exxon Mobil--Exxon Mobil\u2019s portfolio, and effectively competes for capital. As Dan and his team develop that concept and that potential business, that\u2019s looking more and more promising, and we see an opportunity to really leverage the things that we\u2019re pretty good at in the base case, and it\u2019s very synergistic with our traditional businesses. I think when we come out and talk about the plan, we\u2019ll talk more about where we see the lithium business going, but it looks fairly promising at this stage. I would just say, the aperture\u2019s wide open. I think for a long time, we\u2019ve been characterized as an energy company, and that almost discounts what is one of the world\u2019s largest chemical businesses, which we feel pretty good about. It comes back to this fundamental capability of managing and transforming hydrogen and carbon molecules to products that the world needs and leveraging our capabilities, and lithium fits into that along with our other businesses in bio-fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage. We\u2019ll continue to develop those, and again, as I said earlier, seeing that opportunity space and the opportunity to generate higher return projects is looking more and more promising, so I would expect that to be part of the portfolio going forward.\nJason Gabelman: Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nRyan Todd: Thanks. Maybe one follow-up on some of the earlier Permian conversation. You were always known as developing your side of the Permian on a very long term plan. You\u2019d built out a lot of infrastructure early on. On the infrastructure side, as you think about this post the Pioneer transaction on infrastructure, do you have the combined infrastructure in place that you need to arrive at the 2 million barrels a day of combined production? Will this require any additional infrastructure spend or any shift around in how you think about things versus previously anticipated, and maybe just any comments on whether you see any potential bottlenecks in the basin over the next few years.\nNeil Chapman: Yes Ryan, it\u2019s Neil. I\u2019ll take that question. I think as you\u2019re aware, there is a big difference between the Delaware and the Midland Basins. The Midland Basin has got far more mature infrastructure, and I would say that Pioneer has done an exceptional job in both developing and acquiring and contracting both infrastructure to exit product and for water. It\u2019s quite a difference versus the Delaware. Of course, in the Delaware, we had to put in that infrastructure in place. We did it at scale, we built this large central processing facility called Cowboy. We currently have a capacity there of about 250,000 barrels a day of crude and about 400 Mcfd of gas. We plan to expand that.  In the Midland, most of that infrastructure already exists. There is always going to be incremental investment, but nothing like the scale, Ryan, that we have seen in the Delaware. I feel very good about the infrastructure we\u2019ve put in place in the Delaware, and we made that investment upfront. We talked about it in 2018 and 2019, and we\u2019re clearly benefiting from that investment that we made now. Quite a contrast in the Midland.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would add to that, if you go back in time, as we were looking at the integrated value chain, we were certainly focused on the molecules that we were producing in the Permian but we also recognized it was an opportunity for us to take advantage of the geographic locale and the proximity to our facilities in the Gulf Coast to optimize broader Permian production, and so we built the logistics systems, pipeline systems and the capability within our facilities to manage that. What we\u2019re now going to be bringing into the portfolio in the Midland fits very well with this broader play of an integrated value chain and making sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value of those molecules through our own facilities. As we said early on when we first introduced this deal, that piece of the equation, which we believe there is a value opportunity on in terms of better managing the molecules from end to end, from the crude clear through to the finished products, we believe there\u2019s additional opportunity there. We\u2019ve got to get in and work through the details of that. My view is that\u2019s additional upside to what we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s one I feel really good about and the one that, frankly, we anticipated early on by making sure that we\u2019d built the capacity ahead of actually needing it for our own molecules, so we\u2019re in a very good position there.\nNeil Chapman: And Ryan, I didn\u2019t answer your question - do we anticipate any bottlenecks, and the answer to that is based on what we have seen so far during the transition work and the due diligence, the answer is no, we don\u2019t see any bottlenecks in getting to the production levels that we anticipate.\nRyan Todd: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, thanks for the time. Darren, maybe for you or Kathy, my question is on shareholder return. It looks like you paid out a bit over 100% of free cash flow following the prior quarter - I think you were closer to even higher than that, maybe about 118%. I\u2019m just wondering, when you think about shareholder return, will you continue to lean into the buybacks as you look in the out years, or maybe just if you could give a little bit of color. I think I understand your role, your thoughts on the dividend side, so maybe I\u2019m asking a bit more on the share buybacks going forward. Thank you.\nKathryn Mikells: I\u2019m happy to take that. If you look at our overall free cash flow results in the quarter, it was just under $12 billion at $11.7 billion, and we paid out $8.1 billion to shareholders, and that was between $3.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in the share repurchase program. In fact, in the quarter our cash balance actually went up $3.4 billion, and we ended the quarter at $33 billion, so I think you can see that in the quarter, we were in fact well under 100% in terms of what we paid out, which is what enables us to grow our cash balance and strengthen our balance sheet even further. You know, when you look overall at our approach to capital allocation, our priorities continue to be the same. First and foremost, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re investing in advantaged projects that are differentiated, are going to drive high returns for our shareholders. We do that both organically and, as you\u2019ve seen recently, inorganically as well, making sure we\u2019re maintaining a really strong balance sheet - we need that. Ultimately at some point, the cycle will turn against us and that balance sheet will be there for us to lean into, and being balanced in our approach as to how we share the success of the company and those rewards with our shareholders. I think you can continue to see that balance coming through between dividends and share repurchases. We\u2019re looking to be more consistent in our share repurchase program - again, I think you\u2019re seeing that. We continue to say we\u2019re on track to execute $17.5 billion of share repurchases this year. We\u2019ll complete that before the end of the year and we already have a program in place, a similar program in place for 2024, so we\u2019re trying to get that balance right. It\u2019s important that we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that can carry us through the cycle.\nNeal Dingmann: Thank you Kathy.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you, good morning. Neil, the industry in the Permian, whether it\u2019s for emission reasons or for cost efficiency, seems to move and trying to electrify the operation as much as we could, can you share with us where is Exxon in that journey? How far are you in terms of electrifying your operation in the Permian, and when you\u2019re comparing to Pioneer, I don\u2019t know whether you have the information that you can share, and whether you guys are ahead of them or that this will be part of the $2 billion of synergy benefit, or that you\u2019re going to do more aggressively on that, this is going to be on top. Thank you.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, thanks Paul, good to hear from you. From our perspective, we have, I think, 17 rigs running right now in the Permian. All of those rigs are electrified, so we\u2019re 100% on rigs and we\u2019re working on fracs. Right now, I think we have one electric frac out of six frac crews running in the Permian. This is all part of our drive to get to Permian net zero that we said we would get to by 2030. Our plans are in place for that and we\u2019re on schedule for it. That program, it\u2019s simple as this - you have to reduce methane emissions. We\u2019re well on track with reducing methane emissions. We have no routine flaring in the Permian now. We\u2019ve replaced over 6,400 pneumatic devices, so you eliminate or your reduce methane emissions, then you electrify your operations, and as I\u2019ve just described, we\u2019re long way down the road in terms of electrification. Then we have to secure renewable electricity for those rigs and frac crews, and that\u2019s the program we\u2019re working on. In terms of Pioneer, I don\u2019t have those numbers for Pioneer in terms of where they are on electrification, but what we have said is that we\u2019re going to advance Pioneer\u2019s target to go to net zero from 2050 to 2035, so 15 years sooner than anticipated, and that will follow probably that same protocol, that same process of reducing methane, electrification, and then securing renewable electricity.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would add to that, I think Scott and the team at Pioneer have been--this has been an area of focus for them, and I know they have worked hard to drive those down. The advantage that we bring is we\u2019ve got a large organization, more resources. We\u2019ve got a technical organization that has been leaning into this space and working broadly with the industry and other organizations to develop the technology to better manage methane. Neil talked about the central organization that we\u2019ve put in place to kind of monitor everything that\u2019s happening out in the unconventional space and make sure that we\u2019re responding in real time to things that we\u2019re seeing through this centralized operating center.  Bringing the Pioneer portfolio into that center and then allowing us to apply a lot of the work that, frankly, our scale and size has allowed us to advance, I think is going to make a big improvement in what we\u2019re doing with Pioneer, just by bringing additional capability there. I think the culture and the mindset is already in place. We\u2019re now going to bring some additional resources in to apply, and so my expectation is that we\u2019re going to see--we\u2019re going to raise the game here, just because we\u2019re bringing some additional capabilities to support what was already, I think, a very important focus for the Pioneer organization.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Is the savings on your electrification is already built into that $2 billion synergy benefit? \nNeil Chapman: Yes, in terms of the synergy benefits, as you know and we\u2019ve talked about many, many times, it\u2019s not just about the cost of the rig, it\u2019s about the quality of the rig and the performance of the rig, but electrification of those rigs doesn\u2019t really impact that. The electrification of all of those facilities is built into our plans going forward. \nDarren Woods: Yes, I would say our drive to bring their net zero commitment forward by 15 years, we\u2019ve also built that into our thinking around getting net synergies there, so we\u2019ve comprehended the additional effort required to improve the emissions profile and bring their net zero ambitions forward, so all that\u2019s netted with our synergy numbers.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nJosh Silverstein: Thanks, good morning everyone. On the Pioneer acquisition call, you had mentioned that the inventory of the combined companies in the Permian was around 15, 20 years. Was just curious how that may be split between the Pioneer asset and your Delaware asset, and does it contemplate the accelerated growth rate improves the outlying longer laterals or a potential plateau? I\u2019m just curious to get some more details there, because there was a view of Pioneer having over 20 years of inventory, so any more details there would be helpful. Thanks.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, I think Josh, it\u2019s early stages. I mean, the numbers that we gave and that you just referenced in our initial release are based on our understanding. We\u2019d certainly say that the combined resource for the two companies is order of magnitude 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels - that\u2019s 15 to 20 years life. Most of our resource is, as you\u2019re aware, is on the Delaware side. Obviously Pioneer is exclusive in the Midland side, so that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s based on our early assessments.\nJosh Silverstein: Well, maybe if there was just any more details as far as what your split may be of that 16 versus what theirs may be.\nNeil Chapman: Yes, I mean, they\u2019re close, I would say in total. Exxon\u2019s is closer to 9, Pioneer\u2019s is closer to 7, is what I would say in total, but that\u2019s based on our initial understanding.\nDarren Woods: For the resource.\nNeil Chapman: For the resource, yes.\nJosh Silverstein: Okay, that\u2019s it.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our final question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nSam Margolin: Good morning, thanks for taking the question at the end.  I wanted to follow up on the capital allocation question and the dividend increase specifically. We\u2019ve talked a lot about this in the past, that this dividend increase looks like it\u2019s roughly the same as the amount of the share repurchase in terms of percentage, and I know you\u2019re issuing share for Pioneer but you\u2019ve also got a pathway to a lot of upstream growth and then downstream is growing too, as we learned about in the product solutions spotlight. You\u2019re running with sort of a significant operational cash surplus on a recurring basis, even before this growth, and so just wondering about your thoughts on dividend growth going forward and if we are through this period where you were tending the balance sheet and the portfolio, and now some of this growth will translate to sort of a dividend CAGR that is in line with the operations. Thanks.\nKathryn Mikells: Sure, so we have always said we\u2019re looking to ensure we have a dividend that\u2019s sustainable, competitive and growing. I think the increase of $0.04 to the quarterly dividend is very reflective of that. I think it also reflects the overall confidence that we have in the business and the underlying improvement in earnings power that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. I mean, by any metric, this was a really strong quarter, whether you look at earnings, cash, shareholder returns.  It was a very strong quarter and we have a great degree of confidence in the business, so we increased the dividend a bit more than we did about a year ago. Obviously we have a cadence now of looking at the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year, and that increase is very reflective of our confidence in the business and our underlying performance. \nDarren Woods: Yes, I would just add to that, Sam, obviously we view the dividend as a commitment, and as we saw through the pandemic, even when things get tough, we work hard to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to deliver on that commitment to our shareholders. As we think about going forward and the volatility in the markets and the commodity cycle, we do need to make sure that as we think about growth in the dividend, that we also think about sustainability and the ability to deliver on that commitment, irrespective of what the market throws at us. That goes into the equation as we think about that going forward, and when we\u2019ve got additional cash that we want to distribute, we\u2019ve always got the buyback, which obviously as Kathy said, we\u2019re looking to have a more consistent level of that as well. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Thanks for the question.\nSam Margolin: Thank you\nJennifer Driscoll: You\u2019re welcome, and thanks everyone for joining the call and for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on the investor website next week. We look forward to connecting with you again on December 6 for our corporate plan update. With that, have a nice weekend, everyone, and I\u2019ll turn it back to the Operator to conclude our call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "content": "I would say nothing really unusual going on in capex. As you stated, it was a pretty tight range to start with, obviously with a focus on us looking to ensure that we're investing in advantaged high return projects - that's exactly what we're delivering, so I would characterize this as updated guidance that's pretty consistent with our plans, and we can give you a further update when we get to that corporate plan discussion later on in December, but we feel very good about our overall execution.  As Darren mentioned earlier, we're bringing projects online at a cost and schedule that's typically within the top quintile, so we feel really good about our capabilities and our execution and our ongoing focus with our highest priority, ensuring that we're executing great projects with high returns for our shareholders. I'm happy to take that. If you look at our overall free cash flow results in the quarter, it was just under $12 billion at $11.7 billion, and we paid out $8.1 billion to shareholders, and that was between $3.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in the share repurchase program. In fact, in the quarter our cash balance actually went up $3.4 billion, and we ended the quarter at $33 billion, so I think you can see that in the quarter, we were in fact well under 100% in terms of what we paid out, which is what enables us to grow our cash balance and strengthen our balance sheet even further.

            "name": "Neil Chapman",
            "content": "Thanks Darren. Good morning everyone.  As we said with you recently, Pioneer is arguably the best Permian pure play company with the largest undeveloped Tier 1 inventory in the Midland basin. Pioneer's premier asset base is matched by the quality of its workforce. Its employees are innovative and hard working and possess a deep knowledge of unconventional operations in the Permian. When you combine these attributes with our technology and industry-leading operational capabilities, we're confident we can unlock far more value together than either of us could do alone. We expect synergies of approximately $1 billion before tax annually, beginning in the second year post closing, and an average of about $2 billion per year over the next decade driving double-digit returns. This transaction not only strengthens our current position but it also transforms our portfolio, increasing our exposure to short cycle low cost to supply liquids in the United States. Based on our initial assessment, we expect our combined Permian production to increase to approximately 2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by the end of 2027. Downstream, this merger also increases the integration between high value light Permian crude and our premier refinery and chemical footprint on the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Finally, we've said many times that we're working to solve the end equation, providing the energy and products society needs and reducing emissions, both ours and others. This transaction reflects both parts of our commitment. We will increase our Permian production with plans to accelerate Pioneer's net zero plan to 2035 from 2050, and decrease our combined Permian emissions.  With that, I'll pass it to Jennifer. Yes, good morning Neil. You know, what we outlined in the slide with the earnings release is really the basis of what I'd always describe as real, quantifiable synergies that have created the deal space for this transaction. These synergies are already demonstrated in our existing operations, either in the Delaware of the Midland. It does not include the pipeline of new technologies that are either in the early stages of deployment or close to deployment. By applying what we've already demonstrated, we're confident we can recover an additional 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels, more than either Pioneer or industry could have demonstrated with their existing performance. In the charts, we highlight two areas. One, industry's move to cube development. We've moved to cube development to get the higher net present value. We were the pioneer in that, and that's obviously to avoid the parent-child impact. The top chart on there shows that we've been drilling cube since 2020 100% in the Midland, and you can see that over the period, Pioneer has moved to 100% cubes as well. In 2022, when we were both developing 100% cubes, you can see we've got equivalent recovery rates, but we're at notably lower quality acreage, lower quality resource, so equivalent recovery at lower quality resource, and when we look at truly comparable acreage, and that's really, really important because generalizations can lead to misleading results. In the bottom, we talk about adjacent Martin County, where us and Pioneer and one of our other peers are drilling the same 10,000 lateral cubes, you can see we get a 20% higher recovery, and that's why we're all targeting the same intervals. These are [indiscernible] in similar proportions. What varies and what's the difference is the stacking and landing zones, and what varies is the optimal wealth spacing that we are delivering, which includes things like vertical orientation. Just one final point on that, Neil, in terms of recovery - it's not just about how you deliver cubes. When you've got better recovery, when you've got better capital efficiency, it gives access to economically developing what we would describe as secondary benches. As you'll recall, like the Wolfcamp C and like the [indiscernible] mill extension, and in addition obviously we have other techniques that we attempt to keep confidential, which gives us this higher level of recovery. Yes Bob, it's Neil again. I want to be clear - we don't have a volume target. We have a value target, we have a volume outcome, and that's really, really important. For our basis, we've talked about an outcome being a million barrels a day by the end of 2027 based on our Delaware and Midland Basin. Based on our initial assessments of Pioneer's plans, obviously we've had access to that through the due diligence process, we see that with similar capital spending as Pioneer has today, and you can equate that to a similar number of rigs, we would anticipate that Pioneer's production under Exxon Mobil and Pioneer's combined operations would also get to a million barrels a day by the end of 2027.  If you add current production in the Midland Basin from both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil today, it's already at a million barrels a day. It's really important, though - volume is an outcome. We're striving for the value, that's why we focus on the cube development. But I would say the basis is consistent with existing capital spending that Pioneer are making today. We do anticipate, as I've just outlined, improvements in recovery. We do anticipate improvements in capital efficiency based on the synergies that we outlined in the earnings release, but that's not really built into that outlook of a million barrels a day from the Pioneer operations. Yes, thank you. We're really encouraged by what we're seeing in Guyana. Let's just start with the two boats that are in our operation today. Liza 1, or Destiny had a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels a day. We're consistently running that at about 150,000 barrels a day. Liza 2, Unity was a 220 capacity and we've been running that consistently above 240,000 barrels a day, so those two combined are getting close to 400,000 barrels a day, which is quite a bit, and this comes from, I would just say, good operational performance. You look at every aspect of the operations, you tweak them, you push them, and you can get more and more out.  Now, we're starting up Payara, which is 220,000 barrels a day nameplate capacity. We would hope we would expect to have a similar type of uplift. There is no reason to think that we wouldn't. We have to start that up--the plan is to start that up in the middle of November, and that would give us a combined nameplate capacity of 560,000 barrels a day, but obviously with the first two boats running more like 400,000 barrels, we expect to be in excess of 600,000 barrels a day of production.  Just to add to that, we've got three more boats in the pipeline, as you're aware. All three of the boats in the pipeline - that's the Yellowtail, Uaru, and then Whiptail, these are all larger boats, they're all 250,000 barrels a day. Yellowtail and Uara are in construction. Whiptail, we've submitted the development plan to the government, and we would hope and expect to reach FID in 2024 for that, and that will give us a combined nameplate capacity of 1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2027, but that doesn't include the uplift in performance--production performance that we've got on the first two boats. You know, we were certainly--our message to the organization is start it up safely, start it up on time, each boat - that's what we'll do on Payara, and once we get settled, we'll try and follow the same protocols that we've done on the first two boats and strive to get maximum production out of the boat, and that's obviously good for the shareholders, it's good for the co-ventures, and it's even better for the country. Yes, thanks Doug. There's probably two parts to that question. One is exploration and then one is production and capacity. Let me just handle exploration first. You know, we've had, as you're aware, three discoveries this year, including Lancetfish-2, which is the most recent one. We continue to integrate those results, both of exploration and appraisal drilling, and we're going to update that resource base when we see it is a significant change.  Our program of exploration and appraisal continues, and the way I like to frame it is in the southeast corner of the Stabroek Block, we're continuing to appraise around our discoveries, and that will take a lot of work and a lot of activity. You know we have six drill ships in the basin and they're both--they're in development appraisal and exploration drilling.  In addition to all that appraisal drilling that we're doing in the southeast part of the block, we're looking for what I would describe as anchor prospects further to the north and further to the west. We continue to look and we've probably got order of magnitude three, what I'd call true wildcats or exploration targets, looking for [indiscernible] wells in the next 10 to 12 months, something like that. That can change based on results of either the appraisal or the exploration drilling. You know, we're going to update when we see something meaningful and when we see something significant. We've been very clear that we had six FPSOs in the pipeline - they are firm and I just in one of the previous questions outlined all of those. Indeed, they will have a capacity and you strive to keep them full all the time. As you know, Doug, one of the beauties about the Stabroek Block is the density of the resource and the proximity of these boats, which gives that potential for tie-backs well into the future. But the water cut will increase, as everybody knows, in deepwater, so we constantly look. We like to talk about capacity and we optimize as we go, and we will increase the production versus the nameplate capacity as we go, and so that's why I think what we can be firm on is we will have six boats by the end of 2027, they will have a nameplate capacity of 1.2, and obviously we will strive to keep them as full of liquids or of oil as we can over that period. I think as we get closer to 2027, obviously we will update those numbers, Doug. Yes, sure. Thanks. Yes, first of all, I would say it's very early in the process, of course. We've done the due diligence, we're into transition now. I think it's very important to make the point, Pioneer are a very, very capable organization. They've demonstrated that. What we're really excited about is the combination of these two organizations. Pioneer has a deep, deep understanding of the Midland Basin. As we've talked about, this is absolutely in the fairway of Tier 1 quality resource, and Pioneer has done an exceptional job at developing that resource. For our side, we've got a whole range of different operating techniques, development plans and technologies, and it's the integration of those that we're most excited about. Everything we're seeing in the initial transition work would suggest all of that is correct. If you just look at the acreage position and you look at where Exxon are--Exxon Mobil are and Pioneer are, obviously it gives an opportunity for both high grading the inventory, and that includes bolt-ons. I have to say that Scott Sheffield and his organization have done an extraordinary job bolting on and increasing their acreage in the basin, and they have a very, very capable land organization, and we look forward to working with those firms. I think it's a combination that's going to be most powerful in developing that resource. Steve, just one small addition to illustrate that. I've talked before that we have a basin-wide remote operations centers in Houston where we control all our operations in Houston - that's drilling, that's fracking, the field operations, that's methane tracking, methane emissions tracking as well from one central control center in Houston. Obviously our plan would be to bring in the whole Pioneer operations in time to have one central organization. What this gives you is it gives you all that competency, all that expertise, applies is to the whole of Midland Delaware Basins from one central control center. Roger, it's Neil again. Let's just park the Pioneer acquisition for a moment and just talk about our existing plans as Exxon Mobil. Back in 2018 and 2019, I talked about the strength of our developments that we had in the pipeline, and obviously they were headlined by Guyana and by the Permian. What I said at the time is what you will see is an increase in the percent of liquids in our portfolio and a reduction in the percent of dry gas of the total.  If I outlook to 2027, we will go from something sub-65% liquids to something around 70% liquids in our portfolio in 2027, and 15% or thereabouts of liquefied natural gas, so that takes us up to 85%, I would call liquids index. Obviously 80% of our LNG sales index to Brent or to crude oil. That's a big transition but it's driven by the quality of those resources, primarily in the Permian and Guyana, and we're going to be adding onto that, of course, the programs we have developed we have in LNG in Papua New Guinea and then in Mozambique at the end of the decade. I'd just add one other comment - if you take the liquids and the LNG, which would take us to 85% liquids indexed in 2027, of the gas that remains, 7% of that is associated gas, so in other words gas associated with liquids production. You can see that we'll be in the order of magnitude of 7% or 8% of dry gas in our portfolio at that time, and that's pre the Pioneer acquisition. Yes Ryan, it's Neil. I'll take that question. I think as you're aware, there is a big difference between the Delaware and the Midland Basins. The Midland Basin has got far more mature infrastructure, and I would say that Pioneer has done an exceptional job in both developing and acquiring and contracting both infrastructure to exit product and for water. It's quite a difference versus the Delaware. Of course, in the Delaware, we had to put in that infrastructure in place. We did it at scale, we built this large central processing facility called Cowboy. We currently have a capacity there of about 250,000 barrels a day of crude and about 400 Mcfd of gas. We plan to expand that.  In the Midland, most of that infrastructure already exists. There is always going to be incremental investment, but nothing like the scale, Ryan, that we have seen in the Delaware. I feel very good about the infrastructure we've put in place in the Delaware, and we made that investment upfront. We talked about it in 2018 and 2019, and we're clearly benefiting from that investment that we made now. Quite a contrast in the Midland. And Ryan, I didn't answer your question - do we anticipate any bottlenecks, and the answer to that is based on what we have seen so far during the transition work and the due diligence, the answer is no, we don't see any bottlenecks in getting to the production levels that we anticipate. Yes, thanks Paul, good to hear from you. From our perspective, we have, I think, 17 rigs running right now in the Permian. All of those rigs are electrified, so we're 100% on rigs and we're working on fracs. Right now, I think we have one electric frac out of six frac crews running in the Permian. This is all part of our drive to get to Permian net zero that we said we would get to by 2030. Our plans are in place for that and we're on schedule for it. That program, it's simple as this - you have to reduce methane emissions. We're well on track with reducing methane emissions. We have no routine flaring in the Permian now. We've replaced over 6,400 pneumatic devices, so you eliminate or your reduce methane emissions, then you electrify your operations, and as I've just described, we're long way down the road in terms of electrification. Then we have to secure renewable electricity for those rigs and frac crews, and that's the program we're working on. In terms of Pioneer, I don't have those numbers for Pioneer in terms of where they are on electrification, but what we have said is that we're going to advance Pioneer's target to go to net zero from 2050 to 2035, so 15 years sooner than anticipated, and that will follow probably that same protocol, that same process of reducing methane, electrification, and then securing renewable electricity. Yes, in terms of the synergy benefits, as you know and we've talked about many, many times, it's not just about the cost of the rig, it's about the quality of the rig and the performance of the rig, but electrification of those rigs doesn't really impact that. The electrification of all of those facilities is built into our plans going forward. Yes, I think Josh, it's early stages. I mean, the numbers that we gave and that you just referenced in our initial release are based on our understanding. We'd certainly say that the combined resource for the two companies is order of magnitude 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels - that's 15 to 20 years life. Most of our resource is, as you're aware, is on the Delaware side. Obviously Pioneer is exclusive in the Midland side, so that's the way it is. It's based on our early assessments. Yes, I mean, they're close, I would say in total. Exxon's is closer to 9, Pioneer's is closer to 7, is what I would say in total, but that's based on our initial understanding. For the resource, yes."

            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered another robust quarter of earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns, reflecting our ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained industry-leading performance. We reported $9.1 billion of earnings, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to last quarter.  While the market provided a bit of tailwind, our success was enabled by the continued strength of our operational performance, which reflects the hard work of our people across the company. Whether it's continuing to drive efficiency in maintenance and turnarounds, running at high throughputs and utilization rates, or delivering big projects at first quintile cost and schedule, the excellent work of our people underpins our results and sustains our drive to deliver industry-leading performance in everything we do. The work is fundamentally strengthening the underlying earnings power of the company, establishing a strong foundation to deliver industry-leading results in any price environment.  Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share the success of the company with our shareholders. This morning, we were pleased to announce a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share. This year is our 41st consecutive year of annual dividend increases, a record that we're proud of and that we know our investors value highly. We continue to strengthen our portfolio of businesses by investing in advantaged high return opportunities while divesting businesses that are no longer a strategic fit. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our Thailand refinery, bringing our year-to-date cash proceeds from asset sales to more than $3 billion. We followed this in October with the close of the refinery sale in Italy. Recently announced acquisitions are great examples of the and equation, meeting the world's needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions. Acquiring Denbury strengthens our position to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries, which today have limited practical options. We see the potential to drive strong returns with the capacity to reduce the nation's carbon emissions by 100 million tons per year - that's 20 times our current CO2 off-take agreements with CF Industries, Linde and Nucor, which by themselves could reduce CO2 emissions by an amount equivalent to replacing two million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles currently on U.S. roads. We expect to close the transaction in early November with Denbury shareholders scheduled to vote next week. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in another all-stock transaction. This combination will further strengthen our already advantaged upstream portfolio and create significant value for the shareholders of both companies. Together, we will recover more resource more efficiently and with a lower environmental impact. We plan to accelerate Pioneer's Permian net zero ambition by 15 years and fully leverage their advances in water recycling. This deal is a win any way you look at it - good for our shareholders, good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for U.S. energy security. Neil will say more about the benefits of the transaction in a few moments. We're also continuing to drive profitable growth organically. In energy products, we achieved the highest third quarter refinery throughput on record, driven by our Beaumont refinery expansion. At a time of strong demand and low inventories, this project is providing 250,000 barrels per day of much needed new capacity to the market.  In addition, we recently started up our Baytown chemical expansion, which grows volume and improves mix. It provides 750,000 tons per year of new performance chemical capacity, including 350,000 tons of linear alpha olefins, marking our entry into this growing market.  We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance with earnings of $9.1 billion and cash flow from operations of $16 billion. These results reflect the structural earnings improvements we've delivered over the past several years as we've improved our mix of assets and driven significant structural cost reductions, while maintaining our focus on industry-leading safety and reliability. We have lowered our structural costs by $9 billion since 2019, meeting our plan, and expect to deliver additional savings in the fourth quarter. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our base operations, including enhancing our maintenance and turnaround processes, strengthening our digital capabilities, and optimizing our supply chain. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with our full year guidance.  Capex investments of $18.6 billion year-to-date are on plan. We expect 2023 capex to finish the year at the top end of our guidance range as we continue to invest in high return advantaged projects, our top priority for creating long term shareholder value. As always, we remain focused on sharing the company's success with our shareholders. We delivered $8.1 billion in shareholder distributions in the third quarter, $3.7 billion in dividends, and $4.4 billion in share repurchases.  With that, I'll turn it over to Neil. Yes, I would add to Neil's comment, if you recall, we brought all our projects organization together to make sure that we were leveraging the best capability in terms of development in designing these projects. We've also brought together our technology organizations, and the big benefit we have there is we're now leveraging not only the capacity that was in the upstream in terms of optimization around these facilities, but we've decades and decades of experience of people optimizing and running our chemical plants and our refinery facilities to squeeze out and optimize every piece of the production pipeline and make sure that we are at the designed limits of the different equipment. That optimization, which has been kind of the lifeblood of the refining business, given the very narrow margins, has big payoffs when we apply it to the upstream facilities, and so there's an additional benefit just in terms of leveraging the broader organizational capability, which again has been part of our strategy from the very beginning, is to make sure that we're bringing to bear the best thinking across the corporation on the most important facilities and projects, and this is certainly one of those. I'd just add to what Neil said, if you look at what we've been doing over the last six years, it's really been around integrating our organizations, consolidating them, and making sure that we're concentrating like capabilities into the same organization, and that is paying huge dividends. This is no different. The intent is to fully integrate the Pioneer organization and its people into our business. My expectation is we'll bring a lot of advantages to their acreage, but at the same time, we expect their people to bring a lot of advantages to other parts of our business, including what we're doing in the Delaware.  Our whole strategy is really around the value you create by taking experts in areas and getting the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that, so there won't be a separate approach here. It will be one. I think what you're seeing today, to Neil's point, the fact that we're in very early stage, but as we get together and work through the plans and the development, it will be one seamless integrated organization and plan. I'd just add to that, Roger, if you just step back and think more conceptually around the strategy and what we're trying to do, every one of our businesses is focused on moving to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that we remain robust to any period in the commodity cycle and making sure that we're positioned competitively versus everyone else in the industry. That drive over time to reshape the portfolio continues to move our collective production to the left and to lower cost, and then at the same time adding higher value barrels, we're lowering cost and increasing revenue, and so that's where the value game is getting played out. That's the work that we've been doing and that's the high grading that you've seen in the portfolio and the improvements in structural cost. We mentioned at the top of the meeting that we've actually achieved the $9 billion in structural cost this quarter, third quarter, so a quarter ahead of what our initial plans were, and we expect to see more in the fourth quarter. As we go forward with the changes that we've been making in the organization continuing, we're going to continue to deliver more structural cost savings.  The whole strategy is around making sure that we have the best portfolio and the most resilient portfolio, so that we can basically be successful irrespective of the commodity price environment that we're in, and that we're well positioned versus others in the industry. That is the strategy, and you see that playing out certainly in the upstream, but you also seeing it playing out in the downstream where we've been high grading our assets there and playing out in our chemical business, where we continue to bring on units that produce high performance products. That strategy is manifesting itself in each of our businesses. Then I'll just end on that same philosophy underpins what we're doing in low carbon solution. As we build out that business and position ourselves for the long term, it's making sure that every investment that we're making, every value chain that we're creating, that Dan and his team have a clear view about where that will sit in the cost supply curve, or you can think of it as the cost of abatement curve, and making sure that we're going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry. I might just add to that, as we think about capex, we provide that range because we recognized going into the year that things move around a bit, and as we prosecute a plan that with time, we find additional opportunities as things move around. If you look at where we're at through the third quarter, we are right on our plan, and so as we move forward, we're going to continue to do the things that we had planned to do last year, but I would say we're always looking for opportunities to build on the value proposition. If we see it, we're going to go after it. We're not going to constrain ourselves artificially to a guidance range if we find an opportunity set; but to date, things are moving pretty consistent with where we thought we were going to be, and frankly as we look out going forward, continue to see a very consistent set of opportunity sets that we're going to prosecute. I think the one change that we'll spend more time talking about in low carbon solutions is as that business matures and we establish, I'd say, an advantaged position, there are a lot of opportunities coming our way, so we're working our way through those opportunities and making sure that we focus on the highest priority ones, the ones that generate the most value and are competitive in our portfolio. We'll talk more about that as we get into the plan release. Sure, I'll take that. I think just stepping back and maybe setting the context of what we're trying to do, I'll call it in the transition space, and frankly more broadly, go back to the fundamental of what are our key technology competencies and capabilities, and then what businesses lend themselves to those capabilities where we can carve out an advantage and produce the products society needs. Rather than chase what I would say is the current narrative or the current conventional wisdom as to what the world is going to need, it's focus first on what we can fundamentally contribute and bring an advantage to and therefore generate returns higher than the rest of industry, and then figure out how those advantages apply themselves to what the world needs.  Obviously lithium is an important part of the transition going forward in electrification and the need for batteries and storage of power and energy, and so we've looked at that space and clearly with the opportunity at Smackover and the ability to drill, extract the lithium from the brine water and re-inject that, it's got a much lower environmental impact than the current production process for lithium. It fits very well with our capabilities and on the cost of supply curve, it's very competitive, so it looks attractive, and the challenge that we've been giving to Dan and his team is to develop a business plan where that becomes material with respect to what Exxon Mobil--Exxon Mobil's portfolio, and effectively competes for capital. As Dan and his team develop that concept and that potential business, that's looking more and more promising, and we see an opportunity to really leverage the things that we're pretty good at in the base case, and it's very synergistic with our traditional businesses. I think when we come out and talk about the plan, we'll talk more about where we see the lithium business going, but it looks fairly promising at this stage. I would just say, the aperture's wide open. I think for a long time, we've been characterized as an energy company, and that almost discounts what is one of the world's largest chemical businesses, which we feel pretty good about. It comes back to this fundamental capability of managing and transforming hydrogen and carbon molecules to products that the world needs and leveraging our capabilities, and lithium fits into that along with our other businesses in bio-fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage. We'll continue to develop those, and again, as I said earlier, seeing that opportunity space and the opportunity to generate higher return projects is looking more and more promising, so I would expect that to be part of the portfolio going forward. Yes, I would add to that, if you go back in time, as we were looking at the integrated value chain, we were certainly focused on the molecules that we were producing in the Permian but we also recognized it was an opportunity for us to take advantage of the geographic locale and the proximity to our facilities in the Gulf Coast to optimize broader Permian production, and so we built the logistics systems, pipeline systems and the capability within our facilities to manage that. What we're now going to be bringing into the portfolio in the Midland fits very well with this broader play of an integrated value chain and making sure that we're maximizing the value of those molecules through our own facilities. As we said early on when we first introduced this deal, that piece of the equation, which we believe there is a value opportunity on in terms of better managing the molecules from end to end, from the crude clear through to the finished products, we believe there's additional opportunity there. We've got to get in and work through the details of that. My view is that's additional upside to what we've been talking about. It's one I feel really good about and the one that, frankly, we anticipated early on by making sure that we'd built the capacity ahead of actually needing it for our own molecules, so we're in a very good position there. Yes, I would add to that, I think Scott and the team at Pioneer have been--this has been an area of focus for them, and I know they have worked hard to drive those down. The advantage that we bring is we've got a large organization, more resources. We've got a technical organization that has been leaning into this space and working broadly with the industry and other organizations to develop the technology to better manage methane. Neil talked about the central organization that we've put in place to kind of monitor everything that's happening out in the unconventional space and make sure that we're responding in real time to things that we're seeing through this centralized operating center.  Bringing the Pioneer portfolio into that center and then allowing us to apply a lot of the work that, frankly, our scale and size has allowed us to advance, I think is going to make a big improvement in what we're doing with Pioneer, just by bringing additional capability there. I think the culture and the mindset is already in place. We're now going to bring some additional resources in to apply, and so my expectation is that we're going to see--we're going to raise the game here, just because we're bringing some additional capabilities to support what was already, I think, a very important focus for the Pioneer organization. Yes, I would say our drive to bring their net zero commitment forward by 15 years, we've also built that into our thinking around getting net synergies there, so we've comprehended the additional effort required to improve the emissions profile and bring their net zero ambitions forward, so all that's netted with our synergy numbers. For the resource. Yes, I would just add to that, Sam, obviously we view the dividend as a commitment, and as we saw through the pandemic, even when things get tough, we work hard to make sure that we're continuing to deliver on that commitment to our shareholders. As we think about going forward and the volatility in the markets and the commodity cycle, we do need to make sure that as we think about growth in the dividend, that we also think about sustainability and the ability to deliver on that commitment, irrespective of what the market throws at us. That goes into the equation as we think about that going forward, and when we've got additional cash that we want to distribute, we've always got the buyback, which obviously as Kathy said, we're looking to have a more consistent level of that as well. That's kind of how we're thinking about it. Thanks for the question."

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exxon Mobil's second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our slides, script and earnings release are available in the Investors section of our website. In a moment, Darren will provide opening comments. Then we'll take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcement to acquire Denbury and related materials in this presentation, we've included additional information on Slide 2. During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments. These are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You may find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Please note, that we have supplemental information at the end of our slides. Now, let me turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Woods: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to be conducting our earnings call from our Houston campus. As of July 1st, our corporate headquarters is now located at the campus, alongside the senior managers of our businesses and centralized organizations. This is the first time in the company\u2019s history that the senior leadership team of the corporation is located on one site and represents a critical step in continuing the transformation of our business enabling us to improve collaboration and alignment and further leverage synergies across our integrated businesses. The ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained, industry-leading performance was clearly demonstrated in our second-quarter results. We delivered earnings of almost $8 billion, two times higher than what we earned in the second quarter of 2018, under comparable industry commodity prices. That doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advantaged projects, and drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do. With these results, I would like to take a moment to recognize our people. Starting with all those that made the move to Houston. I\u2019m sure you know moves like this are not easy and that many personal sacrifices are made. I\u2019m very thankful for all who did this. Their willingness to disrupt their lives for the benefit of our company is a testament to the dedication of our people whose commitment and hard work underpin all the improvements we are making. I hope our shareholders take comfort in this one, small example of our people\u2019s commitment to the company and have confidence in their resolve to further strengthen our position as an industry leader in all that we do. Our achievements this quarter also demonstrate the progress we\u2019re making in solving the \u201cand\u201d equation: meeting the world\u2019s needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions, both our own and others\u2019. In the Permian, we set another production record and remain on track for an overall growth in production of 10% this year. As I said last quarter, our growth won\u2019t be linear as we execute our development plans that balance and optimize capital efficiency, resource recovery, and production rates. Our priority will remain on driving value, not volumes. In Guyana, we achieved a record quarterly gross production rate of 380,000 barrels per day. Our team in Guyana continues to deliver excellent operating, environmental and safety results, while optimizing and growing production. In fact, we see the potential to increase the combined gross capacity of these two FPSOs to above 400,000 barrels a day with further debottlenecking, which is nearly a 20% increase above the investment basis and a testament to the ingenuity of our people. In the Gulf Coast, we continue to profitably grow our business. In the second quarter we achieved mechanical completion of the Baytown chemical expansion. The project grows volume and improves mix with 750,000 tonnes per annum of additional performance chemical products. The Baytown expansion is the final Product Solutions component of the Growing the Gulf initiative announced in 2017. If you recall, the initiative committed to investments of $20 billion over ten years to capitalize on the US\u2019s advantaged resources, economic growth, and strong regional support for our businesses and the jobs we create. 11 of the 13 projects are up and running. The Baytown expansion, after product qualifications, should begin contributing by the fourth quarter. And Golden Pass, the last of our Growing the Gulf projects, should have its first train up at the back end of 2024. The Growing the Gulf initiative is another example of executing our strategy, investing in advantaged, high-value growth, and delivering on our commitments. Improving the earnings power of our businesses also requires divestments. In the second quarter we completed the divestment of the Billings refinery. Including this sale, cash proceeds from divestments of non-strategic assets have totaled roughly $2 billion year-to-date. In advancing our efforts to better leverage corporate scale and integration, we established three new centralized organizations in the quarter. Consolidating activities previously embedded in each of our businesses: Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply Chain, and Global Trading. They\u2019re all off to a good start and have clear lines of sight to improve performance and lower cost. Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to make progress in building an advantaged, low cost, high-return business in capturing, transporting, and storing carbon. We announced a CO2 offtake agreement with Nucor, one of North America\u2019s largest steel producers. And we signed an agreement to acquire Denbury, which will provide ExxonMobil with the largest owned and operated network of CO2 pipelines in the United States. Combining Denbury\u2019s assets and experience with our capabilities will significantly accelerate and expand our ability to profitably help customers reduce their emissions and allow ExxonMobil to play an even greater role in a thoughtful energy transition. It significantly enhances our competitive position and offers a compelling customer proposition to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize heavy industries which, today, have limited practical options. Of Denbury\u2019s 1,300 miles of CO2 pipeline, roughly 70% are in the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, one of the largest US markets for CO2 reduction and home to some of ExxonMobil\u2019s largest integrated refining and chemical sites and nine of their 10 strategically-located CO2 storage sites are also in this region. We believe the transaction synergies will drive strong growth and returns. A cost-efficient transportation and storage system accelerates CCS deployment for both ExxonMobil and our third-party customers. It supports multiple low-carbon value chains, including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia, and biofuels. Ultimately, we see an opportunity to create a CCS business with the capacity to reduce emissions across the Gulf Coast by up to 100 million tons per year. This transaction will help us do that at a lower cost and faster pace. In fact, we see the potential for a third of the opportunity being actionable in the near term. Which takes us to our customers. Our latest offtake agreement extends our CCS customer base beyond industrial gas and fertilizers into steel. This project will tie into the same CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure we\u2019ll use to serve CF Industries, located just 10 miles from Nucor. Focusing our efforts and investments in areas with concentrated sources of emissions allows us to capture the benefits of scale, reduce our spend per ton of CO2 captured and improves returns. Our work with Nucor supports Louisiana\u2019s goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and it increases the total amount of CO2 we\u2019ve agreed to transport and store for customers to 5 million metric tons per year, equivalent to replacing 2 million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles on the road in the United States today. With the planned Denbury acquisition, the potential reduction could be up to 20 times that. As demonstrated by these new developments, we\u2019re continuing to make significant progress in our plans to lead industry in helping society reduce emissions. A major component of our improved earnings is the structural cost savings that we\u2019ve achieved, currently at $8.3 billion. We remain on track to reach our target of $9 billion in savings by the end of this year. As we develop plans for future years, we\u2019re committed to finding additional savings. Cash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion in the quarter, or $13 billion excluding the change in working capital. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with the full-year guidance we shared last year as part of our Capex investments totaled $12.5 billion year-to-date, also in line with our full-year guidance. And, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continue to share our success with shareholders, distributing $8 billion in cash during the quarter, including $4.3 billion in share repurchases and $3.7 billion in dividends. Before we go to Q&A, I\u2019ll leave you with a few key takeaways from the quarter. First, our work to structurally improve earnings power is paying off, demonstrated this quarter as we doubled earnings versus a comparable price environment in the second quarter of 2018. Our reorganizations, aggressive investments in advantaged projects, and significant reductions in cost are driving value and improving our competitive position. We\u2019ve made great progress and have a clear line of sight to much more. In the back half of this year alone, we expect to bring on two advantaged projects: Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further growing our capacity to generate industry-leading earnings. The company\u2019s ongoing business transformation is giving the organization a better view of end-to-end value creation and focusing us on the highest value opportunities. Today, we are better positioned than ever to realize the value of our scale and the synergies from improving the integration of our businesses. For the first time in our history, we have a corporate technology, projects, trading, supply chain, and business solutions organization allowing us to apply the best solutions and talent to our biggest opportunities. And, importantly, we are developing the most talented people in the industry, providing unrivaled opportunities to meet some of society\u2019s greatest challenges. Their work is delivering exceptional results, driving industry-leading returns on investments, and growth in earnings and cash flow. This, in turn, allows us to distribute cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a sustained, competitive, and growing dividend while maintaining investments in industry advantaged projects including investments in our Low Carbon Solutions business. By leveraging the advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we are laying the foundation for a world-scale, competitively-advantaged, low carbon business with industry-leading returns. The planned acquisition of Denbury is a step in that direction, improving our decarbonization proposition for customers, while generating attractive returns. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with the quarter, the progress it represents and the improved earnings power of the company. We\u2019re confident that we have the right strategy with the right leadership and best people to effectively execute it, delivering sustained growth in shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jennifer.\nJennifer Driscoll: We\u2019ll now begin our Q&A session. Please note, that we continue to request that analyst as a single question as a courtesy to the other analyst. However, please remain on the line in case you need any clarifying questions. Now with that, operator, please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Darren, I wonder if I could pick up on the cost saving target. And I guess my question is, post Denbury, and given that we're already halfway through 2023. Where does that $9 billion cost saving target go through the end of the plan period through 2027?\nDarren Woods: It goes up, Doug, in short. I think as you know, and we've been talking about the reorganizations that we've been executing over the years with some of them just recently executed, puts us in a position to really capture a lot of efficiencies across the whole of the enterprise this year as we develop our corporate plans. Obviously, one of the objectives of these new organizations is to take stock of what they've got in their portfolio and identify the opportunities to further capture the benefits of scale and the synergies that exist between the integrated business and what for the first time represents an opportunity to actually manage processes across these integrated businesses. So I think we've got an opportunity set to drive that cost reduction even further as we head out further in the planned horizon. And my expectation is, when we come back at the end of the year after we've developed the plans, reviewed them with the board and then share them with all of you, we'll provide some perspective on what that opportunity looks like going forward.\nDoug Leggate: Would you care to offer an order of magnitude, Darren?\nKathy Mikells: Doug, I tell you to go back to the Investor Day materials from March of 2022. We had some bridges in it where we kind of laid out earnings and how much structural cost savings we're driving, earnings improvement relative to volume and mix. And I think if you just look at the size of those bars, you'll get a rough order of magnitude.\nDoug Leggate: And then going forward, but I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: You bet. Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning. Darren, you've been clear that you think that there's value to be had potentially in M&A in both low carbon and the Permian and Denbury really well into the former of those two. I'd be curious on your perspective on whether on the M&A markets right now and how are you thinking about approaching opportunistic value creation to that?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Good morning, Neil. I would say that our perspective on that whole space. And I know it's one that's of great interest and we've talked about, it seems like for a number of successive quarters, hasn't really changed quite frankly. I think what we are holding ourselves to and evaluating opportunities in that space is the ability to create unique value, unique shareholder value. And so, the opportunities have to be bigger than what ExxonMobil or any potential acquisition could do independent of one another. So I think you've heard us say that one plus one has to equal three here. And that's what we are -- how we're thinking about that space. Obviously, from the very beginning, back in 2018 when we started talking about better leveraging our key competitive advantages, one of the drives to do that is to open up value opportunities that basically others can\u2019t achieve. And as I've made -- try to make clear in this quarter's prepared remarks and in previous quarters, we're making great progress on better leveraging those competitive advantages, bringing them to bear on the business, delivering bottom line results. The more we do that, the more we advance our technology portfolio, the bigger the opportunity to identify unique value opportunities with other companies. And so, we're continuing to look for that, but we're not going to compromise our expectation of generating returns and growing value for the shareholders. So I think Kathy said many times in the past, we're pretty picky acquires. I don't see us change in that position.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Darren.\nDarren Woods: You bet, Neil.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nDarren Woods: Good morning.\nDevin McDermott: So I wanted to ask about the Permian. You've had strong results so far this year and in the slides you had some interesting charts and some of the advantages you see versus peers and how you develop the asset. I was wondering if you could dive into a little bit more detail on that. When you think about some of the specific drivers that allow you to get such better MPV versus other cube development in the basin, what are those in your view? And as part of that, could you address the resource recovery trends you're seeing and the improvement there and any room for further up-side on that?\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. Al, I guess maybe start by going back to the approach we outlined 2018-2019 timeframe where we said ExxonMobil can bring a different game to the unconventional space and really bring to bear and leverage the capabilities that we have versus many others who are competing in that space. And key amongst those was taking advantage of our scale and balance sheet to develop this asset at scale. And so, you may recall, we talked about the cube development, which was really focusing on how you maximize overall recovery and not near term production. That wasn't a particularly well received approach back in 2018-2019 timeframe, but I think with time, it's demonstrated its value and it's actually manifesting itself in the results that you see today, which is, we're focused on making sure that as we develop the resources and all the benches in that resources, particularly the ones that are connected, that we do that in an optimum way, that develops and maximizes the recovery versus initial production rates. And so that's really important. That cube development, we continue to evolve that. I think we've gotten to a stage now where we feel really good about how we're executing that development. We focused on capital efficiency. And I would tell you today, we are setting records for the length of our lateral wells, which, again, lowers the cost associated with accessing the resource. And importantly, as you drill longer wells, it's critical that the productivity of each foot of that well remains constant. And so, we've done a lot of work to make sure that the productivity of each foot is consistent as we drill longer and longer. So that's driving capital costs down pretty significantly. And then I would say, we've got a lot of technologies that we're trialing, ones that I won't go into specific detail on to try to match some eyes recovery. And we've got those technologies deployed in the field. We've got some early results that are quite encouraging, but they aren't at the scale today to manifest themselves completely in our results. So, I think all those things together continue to give us a lot of confidence that not only have we moved to the front of the pack and demonstrated industry leadership with what we've got today that we see a lot of upside to that as we move forward and I don't think we've reached the end of the optimization process yet.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thanks Darren.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: Moving next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: This question is about EOR. Hopefully, you don't find it too far afield. But because you are [Technical Difficulty]\nJennifer Driscoll: Devin, you are kind of breaking up on us. Sam, are you available? Operator, let's try another question and come back to Sam.\nOperator: Okay. We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm just looking at your bridge for energy products and you have over $2 billion of negative margin, it's right in line with the number out of your 8-K, so no surprises there, but definitely a bigger decline on a relative basis than we're seeing from your couple of peers that have reported so far. So, just looking for any additional color on the drivers of that margin decline? Maybe there's something to call out around regional mix or crude slates that are a bit more unique to Exxon?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. I wouldn't say there's anything unique. I mean, this is a straight flow through of just what the industry refining margin reduction is kind of flowing through. We would see a much bigger reduction coming out of where we have a bigger footprint. So I would say even though the US tends to have better margins than the rest of the world, we obviously have a very big footprint in the US. And so, just that footprint drives a bigger absolute number and absolute decline, but it's just a straight flow through from the change in industry margins.\nDarren Woods: Yes, the size of our refining business is much, much larger than our peers. So the impacts associated with the changes in those margins have a bigger impact on us than you'd see with our peers.\nJohn Royall: Sure. I was just looking at it's kind of like a 50% cut to the 1Q number on the margin side. But yes, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes, hello. Good morning.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Roger.\nKathy Mikells: Good morning.\nRoger Read: I'd like to follow-up on the chemicals margin. You made the comment on the opening about margin -- excuse me, pricing where it was in 2018, but margins much better. That said, chemicals isn't quite back to the 2021 high point. So anything else you can offer on how the chemical outlook is getting any better? And one of the reasons I'll ask that question is, when we look at the softness in NGL prices in the US and this expectation of much higher exports, we hear talk about increase in China chemical capacity. So, how should we kind of juxtapose what looks like an improving market for you, certainly better margins versus potentially a lot of new capacity into that area.\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. I think, first of all, what I'd say is, the work that we've done over the years to make sure that we've got a well-diversified feed slate for our chemicals business continues to pay off, particularly in these markets as things are shifting around and price spreads are moving. Our organization is pretty adopted responding to those price signals and change in feed. So that continues to make its way to the bottom line and position us better than many of our peers with that flexibility and the feed optionality that we have. I think as you look around the world, early on there was -- with China being in a COVID lockdown and recognizing the role that it has in chemicals demand. That was kind of the back half of last year. And the impact and as we've come into this year, I think a lot of expectations for China to pick up and with that growth in demand in chemicals we are seeing that starting to happen. In fact, if you look at the -- ourselves in chemicals, the second quarter was stronger than the first quarter. So we are seeing that. The demand looks pretty reasonable, I would say. I mean, the big -- that challenge and you've referenced it is the amount of supply that's come on. And that's where I think our feedstock advantages and our footprint in the integration that we have with a number of refineries around the world actually positions us better. But it'll take some time is my expectation for demand to kind of take us out of the supply, the excess supply that we've got on the marketplace, but I would just add that, we've made a lot of investment in chemicals over the last five years, fairly significant investments. And one of the things that frankly I'm quite pleased with is, if you look at all those chemical investments that we brought online, even in the depths of what is a pretty low bottom of cycle condition for our chemical business, all of those brand new projects are earnings positive and cash positive, which I think really bodes well for when the market comes back up and we're at top of cycle. So, I feel good about how we position the business and, frankly, we're doing exactly what we had hoped for, which is, when you get into tough conditions that our business continues to outperform competition. And so it puts us in a good position as markets tighten back up again and margins improve we will be in an even better position.\nKathy Mikells: And I would add a couple of quick stats to that. So relative to competition, again, our geographic footprint is pretty advantaged. And so, we're about 35% larger in North America than, I'll call it, rest of industry. And then the other thing I'd point out that gets to what Darren just said about some of the projects we've been implementing, those projects helped to support an improvement in our overall mix. And so, this quarter, we saw a 6% increase in performance chemical products and those carry a higher margin. So those are some of the more systemic things that help to drive improvement relative to competitors.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you. Follow-up question on the carbon capture side of the business. If we look, we\u2019ve got global coal demand hitting a record in 2023, global oil demand is going to hit a record in 2023, if it hasn't already. Just curious, Darren, is there -- when you were -- you've already laid out your strategy, all that makes sense. The Denbury acquisition certainly fits well in that. Just curious if you're getting any additional sort of outside pressure to maybe accelerate something on this, given that, if you think about it from an energy transition standpoint, two or three years ago, everybody was saying we would have already had peak demand for this, peak demand for that, clearly not happening. If we're going to have a lot more carbon emissions, are you getting any additional pressure to accelerate carbon capture?\nDarren Woods: Yes, I think what you're seeing today is a reflection of the challenge that the world faces, and frankly, an incomplete solution set. And I think unfortunately the focus, if you go back several years, and I would say the exclusive focus on wind, solar and EVs and the fact that other alternatives and other solutions that frankly at the time we were advocating for and in fact trying to develop internally weren't considered or actually -- weren't actually accepted as slowed society's progress and its emissions reductions in capturing. I think today, there's this recognition that we need more solutions and that frankly the industry can bring those solutions to bear. And at this stage of what is going to be a very complicated and expensive transition, we need as many solutions on the table as possible. Not eliminating any of them and staying focused on emissions reductions. I think that\u2019s starting to resonate. And so, I don't -- the challenge here is, this is a very nascent, the areas that we're focused on, which are the molecule oriented parts of the business that are very consistent with our capabilities and expertise and advantages, that's a -- we're in the very early stages. Frankly, we're in the lead in that space. There aren't any other companies that have secured the kind of third party mission reduction opportunities that we have that would -- there aren't any parties out there that have got the scale of the investments that we're progressing. And so, I think generally, people recognize that we're delivering on our ambition to lead the industry. And more than anything else, we are supportive. Obviously, there's a desire to make things go faster. And frankly, that's a function of the opportunity set. And if you think about the IRA and the role it plays, that legislation hasn't even been translated into regulations yet and that's going to be a critical step. And I think there are many governments around the world who are working on appropriate legislation to incentivize and create a carbon -- market for carbon that hasn't come to be yet. So there, we're very early in this process and there are a number of players in here who have a role deliver. We feel like we're delivering on our part, but there are other elements that have to come together for this to be successful. And then ultimately, we're going to need advances in technology to keep driving that cost down so that we can get to more and more diluted streams of CO2. And we're doing a lot of work in that space. And frankly, again, I think our pipeline of opportunities, our technology pipeline, I feel pretty good about it. And I hope to, in the next several years to hopefully commercialize some technologies to further reduce the cost of emissions reductions. So I think early, a lot of work going on. I think we're making a lot of good progress and we feel good about the role that we're playing in the leadership position that we have.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Hello. Is that is that better, sound wise?\nDarren Woods: That is better. That's better, Sam. Welcome back.\nSam Margolin: I'm okay. So this question is about EOR as it pertains to Denbury. I think, there's some optimism that EOR barrels might be credited with carbon attributes because it varies more CO2 than the associated emissions of the oil. And so, maybe that's option value, but I was just wondering where you stand on that topic and if it was at all a factor as you look at different asset classes and saw that EOR was available?\nDarren Woods: Yes. So I would say, obviously, that's the core business today of Denbury and had facilitated infrastructure that they have in place. That frankly for us was not a key driver, strategic driver of the opportunity. I think EOR certainly in the short term can play a role. But if you think about the broader opportunity, it's really around carbon capture storage, sequestration and keeping the carbon under the ground. So that's the longer term play for us. I mean, as I just commented here about the challenges with the regulation and the translation of the IRA into regulation, we've got Class 6 well Permian, that's going to be required for sequestration. That's a fairly slow progress to date. So, there's a lot of work that has to go into putting these pieces together so that we're successful. I see EOR as providing a lot of optionality in the short term that as we're bringing on carbon capture facilities, working with third parties and we start capturing the CO2. If we don't have everything lined up on the sequestration side, the EOR gives us an opportunity to progress these things and not lose schedules. So, I think right now that's the way I would think about it. It's certainly not a strategic thrust for us as a company.\nSam Margolin: Understood. Thank you so much.\nDarren Woods: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Richardson: Good morning. I was wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the debottlenecking opportunity you talked about in Guyana, clearly 20% above nameplate is or above design is pretty significant. Darren, could you drill in a little bit on what you're seeing here? Is it changes to -- in the subsurface? Is it changes in the kit? Is it uptime? Kind of scale that for us And maybe just, I mean, there's really significant benefits if you roll it forward on a couple of the other projects that you have in the queue. So maybe just talk about how it's changing your view of the future opportunities? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. And thanks for the questions. That's something that frankly the organization has spent decades kind of working. I'll start by just -- I bucket it in three distinct buckets. First, it starts with the design and build out of the project itself. And so, having a projects organization with the capability that we've built and strengthened here over the last several years, we end up with facilities that have the right design and are built the right way so that we've got a really good platform to optimize and a good opportunity to squeeze to find opportunities to maximize and optimize the production coming out of the facilities without compromising any of the design specifications, staying well within safe operating envelopes. And we've done that over the years in a lot of our facilities. And I think this project organization even extends that capability with the skills that they bring to the project development and the build out. And then I'd say the second bucket is our operations organization and the focus that they put on maximizing utilization and production. And I think the mindset in the company is, once you've got steel on the ground, you've got this capital. The operations job is to run it reliably, run it safely, run it in an environmentally responsible way, but at the same time maximize the value of that steel in the ground and they've done a tremendous job of that. And it's not one big thing. It's a lot of little things that that organization stays focused on and pushes. And again, we've seen that not only in Guyana, but really all the capital projects that we've been bringing on the organization done a great job of making sure that we're maximizing the value of the capital that we've invested. And then the third bucket I would say is our technology organization. And again, we've taken the step to consolidate all of our technology organizations and move from what was a business oriented construct to a capabilities construct. And so, we've got our best people brought together working on our biggest opportunities. It's really driving innovation and creativity. And this close partnership that technology now has with the business and the shared commitment to drive value leads to more technology getting out in the field and assisting the operations group and squeezing. So I'd say all those are coming together. My expectation is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, we're going to see the first two FPSOs get above 400,000 barrels a day as we continue to optimize and we'll do that in a very safe and environmentally responsible way. My expectation is when the third boat comes on with [indiscernible], we'll see similar levels of improvement there. And frankly, the expectation that we have for ourselves is that, as we build -- go forward and continue to build these projects, we'll continue to find the same kind of benefits and optimization opportunities with the projects and it comes back to this inherent capability that we built into our businesses.\nStephen Richardson: Thanks so much.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nKathy Mikells: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Todd: Good morning. A question maybe on -- back on the upstream. I mean, even given the pricing environment, upstream performance that we've seen for the quarter, not just for you, but for the other peers that reported this week, have been a little weaker than expected with much of that seemingly driven by the global gas environment. Can you talk about drivers or headwinds that you maybe saw during the quarter on pricing relative to headline markers, maybe headwinds in trading or any other potential drivers there and how those might evolve over the remainder of this year?\nDarren Woods: I'll let Kathy maybe dive into a little more detail. I would just say, with respect to pricing and the impact on the business, actually our quarter came in pretty much in line with what we had expected. If you looked at the 8-K that we put out and our best attempt to model the impact. Just from the market environment, we are pretty rigorous in making sure that when we put an 8-K out there, it's really focused on discrete planned events, but much more importantly on what the market impact has been to the business quarter-on-quarter. And so I think that kind of laid out pretty consistently with what we expected. Obviously, gas prices were down, but I think refining margins are down a bit but still in very healthy territory. And if you look at the fundamentals, quite frankly, as we head into the back half of the year, I think as demand picks up, we're going to see limits that we have on additional supply, I think, come back into the mix and see the supply/demand tighten up a bit. So, my expectation is, the back half of the year, we'll see some an upward pressure just given demand changes in the limited options we have to significantly increase supply. Kathy, anything to add to that?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. I'll mention a couple of other things to you. As a result of some of the divestments we've done over the past year, if you look at our gas portfolio, we're now about 45% LNG, so a little bit more tipped to LNG. If you just look at kind of impact of pricing across our gas portfolio and results, I mean, Henry Hub was down about 40%. TTF was down almost 50%. And the last thing I'd say is we always talk about the fact that on LNG a lot of our contracts are tied to lagged oil prices. And so, if you just look at where oil prices were in the fourth quarter kind of relative to where they are more currently, I'm going to call them down roughly $10 a barrel. And so, that pricing impact would have flowed through as well. And then the last thing that I will mention associated with our trading results is, if you exclude mark-to-market, so if you look in upstream, mark-to-market was a positive for us in the quarter. But if you exclude it mark-to-market, I would have then said our gas trading results were a little bit lighter this quarter. So kind of all of that packaged together, I think, gives you a pretty good understanding of our gas results.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about another energy transition area that's been receiving some attention in the media in terms of Exxon's activity, which is, lithium drilling and then refining. And it seems like you're waiting a bit more into the space. I'm wondering how you view that opportunity, given your expertise in drilling and refining of materials in the ground. And if that development in that space was contemplated at all in that $17 billion energy transition budget that you previously laid out? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes. Maybe I'll just come back to kind of the fundamentals of how we think about ExxonMobil's participation in the transition space. And it comes back to the focus on leveraging the advantages that we have as a corporation where we believe we can add unique value. That's why we have, since the very beginning, stayed focused on what I'd say is the molecule side of the equation in carbon capture and hydrogen and biofuels. But we're looking at, frankly, all the areas that we believe we have an expertise and a unique capability and seeing if there's a fit for products or solutions that can help society decarbonize. Lithium and production of lithium from brine water is, if you think about what's required to do that is really an extension of a lot of the current capabilities that we have in our upstream. It requires a good understanding of the subsurface, requires a good understanding of reservoir management, requires drilling and injections. And so, I think the below surface things are very much in line with the skills and capabilities that we've built out over the decades in our upstream business. The processing of the brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries and chemical plants and in fact, in some of our upstream operations. So that piece of the equation is, again, not new to the company. So as you look at all that, I think the capability, the skill set that we have, the operating experience that we have all lend themselves to that. And then, of course, there's the question of how does the market fundamentals look and supply and demand? And do we see a role for what we're doing there? And frankly, we've been looking at that for quite some time. I'd say we're still early in evaluating the opportunity, but we believe that by, again, applying our advantages in this space that we can bring on a much needed resource, lithium, one that's predicted to go short, we can bring it on at a much lower cost. And I think importantly, with much less environmental impact versus, say, the open mining that they're doing in other parts of the world. So this, to us, feels like a potential win-win-win opportunity, a win using our capabilities, a win from an environmental impact standpoint and a win in terms of supplying markets with a crucial component to electrification and EV. So, I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And we're, I'd say, actively exploring that opportunity set and like what we're seeing so far.\nJason Gabelman: Great. That\u2019s really helpful color. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJosh Silverstein: Thanks. Good morning, guys. The cash balance is still around $30 billion for about four quarters now. And Kathy, last quarter, you mentioned that you were comfortable holding the larger balance because of the net positive spread in interest rates versus your debt cost. The spread is still there, so you're probably not in a rush to do anything, but just wondering if this is still the best use of cash versus deploying it into higher rate of return projects or buybacks. And if the forward curve holds the current kind of strip right now, can you foresee Exxon going into a net cash position next year? Thanks.\nKathy Mikells: Sure. And so, we're pretty happy with our overall balance sheet position right now. And I've stated for a couple of quarters now that we expect our cash balance is going to ebb and flow a little bit just based on how the commodity price environment and margin environment ebbs and flows. So we think it's pretty critical to hang on to a really strong balance sheet because it gives us the flexibility that we need through the cycle. If you look overall at what we're doing from an investment perspective, I would say we're never trying to constrain the organization in terms of deploying good capital investments. And that's across our entire business. It includes our LCS business. Obviously, the acquisition of Denbury will enable us to accelerate the growth of our carbon capture and sequestration business within LCS. And we're excited about that opportunity and profitably growing that part of our business. So I think it's really important when we talk about capital deployment that we are not trying to constrain the company from new capital projects that can drive good returns for our shareholders. And that's how we create, I'd say, the virtuous cycle of how we can then support competitive growing dividends that are sustainable over the long term and a more consistent share repurchase program. So I'd say we're really happy with our balance sheet. We intend to hang on to a higher cash balance than the company has done historically just to give us more flexibility as we think about how we manage the company over the long term and through the cycles.\nDarren Woods: And just maybe to emphasize the point a third time that Kathy made, the mandate to the businesses is find advantaged projects that position us ahead of competition and deliver high returns, high value. And that's the mandate they've been given. And we will fund those opportunities as they come forward. I think what you see in terms of the -- what limits the investment is the ability, those opportunities -- to manifest those opportunities. And I think it's the challenge that we give our organization to only fund the things that we feel confident are robust to a very low price environment, are well ahead of other companies and tap into what I would say are the fundamental -- long-term fundamentals of the market. I think as we find those things and the organization is very focused on developing those opportunity set, we'll fund them because that's how you generate long-term value for the corporation and our shareholders.\nJosh Silverstein: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning. Thanks for the time. My question is on OFS costs, just your thoughts, both domestically and internationally for the remainder of the year and into 2024, how you're thinking about either inflation or deflation?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. I mean, the way that we're thinking about inflation and whether it's oilfield services costs or other costs across the business, I'd say we've gone to a point where we're actually starting to see inflation come off in certain cost categories. If you think about some of the chemicals that we would use in unconventional, things like sand, what we would call tubular goods, which would include piping and valves and those types of things, we're starting to see some deflationary pressure now. As it relates to things where labor is a high component of the cost, I would say, we're not yet necessarily seeing that deflationary pressure coming through yet. But overall, I'd say it's probably too early to see much of that come through the second half of the year. But as we're looking forward into 2024, I'd say we fundamentally feel like inflation is going to come off as we're looking forward, because we're starting to see those signs across multiple categories now throughout the business.\nNeal Dingmann: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. You [indiscernible] to spend $17 billion in the low carbon business through 2027. Denbury sale acquisition is about 30%. And you're also saying that you're seeing a lot more opportunities. So should we interpret that your $17 billion that number, we'll need to -- will increase perhaps quite substantially?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think as you rightly point out, the Denbury acquisition was not part of the $17 billion. And maybe just a little bit of perspective on that, given the we're just starting that business up, as you can imagine, very early and the opportunity set and progressing the opportunity set. I think Dan and his team in the Low Carbon Solutions business have made tremendous progress in bringing those opportunities to bear and manifesting contracts with customers as we've talked about with the three big customers that we now have and demonstrating that we can decarbonize some of these hard-to-decarbonize industries that don't have a lot of good alternatives. We've also got a very significant investment opportunity in Baytown to bring on the world's largest hydrogen plant. And then we've got opportunities for low carbon ammonia associated with that. So I think a pretty robust portfolio. And with the announcements of the deals that we've got to date, the commercial deals that we struck with the announcement of Denbury, I think a lot of recognition and interest by outside potential customers that there's a real opportunity here and that ExxonMobil provides a real solution. So that's the context. I would say the $17 billion as we -- that was -- looking at a portfolio of opportunities and then trying to assess how those -- how quickly those opportunities would manifest themselves in the capital that'd be required to do that, we're continuing that work. There's a lot -- and so as we continue to develop and make progress on these projects, some of the capital becomes more discrete, and we can see it a lot clearer, other deals move out. And so I'd say right now, it's a portfolio approach. We're not changing the $17 billion to date. Frankly, the Denbury acquisition, if that goes through, will allow us to pull back on some of the grassroots investments that we were making in logistics and substitute that with the assets that we brought in from Denbury. So it's, I'd say, kind of an evolving space. I think the thing to stay focused on, we're not going to compromise on our return criteria or the advantaged criteria that we're insisting on for the projects that we bring to bear. We have to be low-cost suppliers in this space. We have to be leveraging the advantages the corporation has, and we have to be generating good competitive returns. That's going to dictate the pace of the -- how quickly that CapEx manifests itself and frankly, the size of it. And as we go through this year's plan, I know Dan and his team are very focused on based on a year -- having a year under their belt of continuing to execute and drive this business. We'll develop more detailed plans and update that number. I don't know, Kathy, do you have anything you want to add for Paul?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. Just the other thing I want to mention is, especially as it relates to the CCS business, what you're going to see over time is that, we're building a backlog. And that backlog is what's going to support the future growing CapEx kind of over the longer term and the profitable growth of that business. So today, I would describe ExxonMobil's backlog is 5 million tons annually, supported by three very large industrial customers, one in the industrial gas sector, one in the steel sector, one that makes ammonia that's used for fertilizer, right? And if you just think about what that does for society, those 5 million tons annually, that translates into the conversion of about 2 million cars from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. That's about all the cars around the road in the United States today. And when we talk about the overall CCS opportunity across the Gulf Coast, we talk about 100 million tons annually. That's 20 times that number. But I'm going to go back to the fact that it will be supported by customer backlog that supports a growing profitable business. So that's how you should think about it.\nPaul Cheng: Great. Thank you. Can I sneak in a real quick question?\nKathy Mikells: Of course.\nPaul Cheng: Yes. Real quick. Darren, do you have a number, you can share what is the production for Permian this quarter -- in the second quarter?\nKathy Mikells: 620 koebd.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet, Paul.\nOperator: I think we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.\nPaul Sankey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up, actually, just looking at your volumes upstream. First of all, you mentioned that there was turnarounds and stuff, but I wondered if you could talk about the recovery, especially in the light of the stronger Guyana volumes, the fact that your upstream volumes are down quite hard here. Is that going to be a rapid recovery in Q3 and back towards what kind of levels should we expect for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure, Paul, I'll take that. If you think about the first quarter, we were up pretty significantly, second quarter down from that first quarter, but essentially on plan with respect to the full year production levels that we talked about at the back end of last year when we put our plan forward. And I would tell you that there's nothing that we're seeing today that changes that guidance that we gave last year at 3.7 million barrels a day of production. So I'd say we're on track with that. We're not seeing anything that makes us change our mind. And obviously, we're working real hard to do better than that. But I would say, right now, we feel like we're on track to meet the plan and meet the numbers that we shared earlier last year.\nPaul Sankey: Can you say more about the downtimes that you had in Q2?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. I'll just mention, we had given a bit of guidance to divestment and scheduled downtime. And that guidance was that we thought we'd see a reduction of about 110 koebd as I said what the actuals were across both of those items. It was actually 120 koebd, and that's a sequential number. So we were down sequentially 120 koebd as a result of divestments and the scheduled downtime. If you then just look at why was our overall production down a little bit more than that, it was really driven by two things. So we've seen curtailments and obviously, OPEC is cutting production, and so we have an impact coming from that. And then in terms of unscheduled downtime, we had a short strike in Nigeria that tipped up our unscheduled downtime. But again, I would go back to what Darren said, we had guided for the full year at about 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels a day. And if you look at our year-to-date numbers, we're up about 15,000 on a year-to-date basis year-over-year.\nPaul Sankey : That's super helpful. And then if I just follow up, if I look at your energy product sales, those are up just about as much, if not more, positively. Obviously, that's mostly Beaumont, I guess. But is there anything else to add there to the strength?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. No, Beaumont is the main thing. And then we obviously had a bit less maintenance kind of going on, which helped our volumes as well. I'd mention that Beaumont was running at 90% utilization. So again, a really nice, I think, proof point and just the operational excellence across the company.\nPaul Sankey: Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Paul.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thanks, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our Investors section of our website as soon as it's available early next week. Before we conclude, I have one important announcement to share with you. Please mark your calendars for the ExxonMobil Product Solutions Spotlight. It's going to be on Wednesday, September 20 at 1:00 Central Time. Jack Williams, Senior Vice President, who oversees Product Solutions will be joined by Karen McGee, President of Product Solutions and several other leaders from ExxonMobil to talk about this new group formed in April 2022. For additional information about this upcoming event, watch the Investors section of our website. With that, have a nice weekend, everyone, and I'll turn it back to the operator to close it off.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to be conducting our earnings call from our Houston campus. As of July 1st, our corporate headquarters is now located at the campus, alongside the senior managers of our businesses and centralized organizations. This is the first time in the company's history that the senior leadership team of the corporation is located on one site and represents a critical step in continuing the transformation of our business enabling us to improve collaboration and alignment and further leverage synergies across our integrated businesses. The ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained, industry-leading performance was clearly demonstrated in our second-quarter results. We delivered earnings of almost $8 billion, two times higher than what we earned in the second quarter of 2018, under comparable industry commodity prices. That doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advantaged projects, and drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do. With these results, I would like to take a moment to recognize our people. Starting with all those that made the move to Houston. I'm sure you know moves like this are not easy and that many personal sacrifices are made. I'm very thankful for all who did this. Their willingness to disrupt their lives for the benefit of our company is a testament to the dedication of our people whose commitment and hard work underpin all the improvements we are making. I hope our shareholders take comfort in this one, small example of our people's commitment to the company and have confidence in their resolve to further strengthen our position as an industry leader in all that we do. Our achievements this quarter also demonstrate the progress we're making in solving the \u201cand\u201d equation: meeting the world's needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions, both our own and others'. In the Permian, we set another production record and remain on track for an overall growth in production of 10% this year. As I said last quarter, our growth won't be linear as we execute our development plans that balance and optimize capital efficiency, resource recovery, and production rates. Our priority will remain on driving value, not volumes. In Guyana, we achieved a record quarterly gross production rate of 380,000 barrels per day. Our team in Guyana continues to deliver excellent operating, environmental and safety results, while optimizing and growing production. In fact, we see the potential to increase the combined gross capacity of these two FPSOs to above 400,000 barrels a day with further debottlenecking, which is nearly a 20% increase above the investment basis and a testament to the ingenuity of our people. In the Gulf Coast, we continue to profitably grow our business. In the second quarter we achieved mechanical completion of the Baytown chemical expansion. The project grows volume and improves mix with 750,000 tonnes per annum of additional performance chemical products. The Baytown expansion is the final Product Solutions component of the Growing the Gulf initiative announced in 2017. If you recall, the initiative committed to investments of $20 billion over ten years to capitalize on the US's advantaged resources, economic growth, and strong regional support for our businesses and the jobs we create. 11 of the 13 projects are up and running. The Baytown expansion, after product qualifications, should begin contributing by the fourth quarter. And Golden Pass, the last of our Growing the Gulf projects, should have its first train up at the back end of 2024. The Growing the Gulf initiative is another example of executing our strategy, investing in advantaged, high-value growth, and delivering on our commitments. Improving the earnings power of our businesses also requires divestments. In the second quarter we completed the divestment of the Billings refinery. Including this sale, cash proceeds from divestments of non-strategic assets have totaled roughly $2 billion year-to-date. In advancing our efforts to better leverage corporate scale and integration, we established three new centralized organizations in the quarter. Consolidating activities previously embedded in each of our businesses: Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply Chain, and Global Trading. They're all off to a good start and have clear lines of sight to improve performance and lower cost. Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to make progress in building an advantaged, low cost, high-return business in capturing, transporting, and storing carbon. We announced a CO2 offtake agreement with Nucor, one of North America's largest steel producers. And we signed an agreement to acquire Denbury, which will provide ExxonMobil with the largest owned and operated network of CO2 pipelines in the United States. Combining Denbury's assets and experience with our capabilities will significantly accelerate and expand our ability to profitably help customers reduce their emissions and allow ExxonMobil to play an even greater role in a thoughtful energy transition. It significantly enhances our competitive position and offers a compelling customer proposition to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize heavy industries which, today, have limited practical options. Of Denbury's 1,300 miles of CO2 pipeline, roughly 70% are in the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, one of the largest US markets for CO2 reduction and home to some of ExxonMobil's largest integrated refining and chemical sites and nine of their 10 strategically-located CO2 storage sites are also in this region. We believe the transaction synergies will drive strong growth and returns. A cost-efficient transportation and storage system accelerates CCS deployment for both ExxonMobil and our third-party customers. It supports multiple low-carbon value chains, including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia, and biofuels. Ultimately, we see an opportunity to create a CCS business with the capacity to reduce emissions across the Gulf Coast by up to 100 million tons per year. This transaction will help us do that at a lower cost and faster pace. In fact, we see the potential for a third of the opportunity being actionable in the near term. Which takes us to our customers. Our latest offtake agreement extends our CCS customer base beyond industrial gas and fertilizers into steel. This project will tie into the same CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure we'll use to serve CF Industries, located just 10 miles from Nucor. Focusing our efforts and investments in areas with concentrated sources of emissions allows us to capture the benefits of scale, reduce our spend per ton of CO2 captured and improves returns. Our work with Nucor supports Louisiana's goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and it increases the total amount of CO2 we've agreed to transport and store for customers to 5 million metric tons per year, equivalent to replacing 2 million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles on the road in the United States today. With the planned Denbury acquisition, the potential reduction could be up to 20 times that. As demonstrated by these new developments, we're continuing to make significant progress in our plans to lead industry in helping society reduce emissions. A major component of our improved earnings is the structural cost savings that we've achieved, currently at $8.3 billion. We remain on track to reach our target of $9 billion in savings by the end of this year. As we develop plans for future years, we're committed to finding additional savings. Cash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion in the quarter, or $13 billion excluding the change in working capital. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with the full-year guidance we shared last year as part of our Capex investments totaled $12.5 billion year-to-date, also in line with our full-year guidance. And, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continue to share our success with shareholders, distributing $8 billion in cash during the quarter, including $4.3 billion in share repurchases and $3.7 billion in dividends. Before we go to Q&A, I'll leave you with a few key takeaways from the quarter. First, our work to structurally improve earnings power is paying off, demonstrated this quarter as we doubled earnings versus a comparable price environment in the second quarter of 2018. Our reorganizations, aggressive investments in advantaged projects, and significant reductions in cost are driving value and improving our competitive position. We've made great progress and have a clear line of sight to much more. In the back half of this year alone, we expect to bring on two advantaged projects: Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further growing our capacity to generate industry-leading earnings. The company's ongoing business transformation is giving the organization a better view of end-to-end value creation and focusing us on the highest value opportunities. Today, we are better positioned than ever to realize the value of our scale and the synergies from improving the integration of our businesses. For the first time in our history, we have a corporate technology, projects, trading, supply chain, and business solutions organization allowing us to apply the best solutions and talent to our biggest opportunities. And, importantly, we are developing the most talented people in the industry, providing unrivaled opportunities to meet some of society's greatest challenges. Their work is delivering exceptional results, driving industry-leading returns on investments, and growth in earnings and cash flow. This, in turn, allows us to distribute cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a sustained, competitive, and growing dividend while maintaining investments in industry advantaged projects including investments in our Low Carbon Solutions business. By leveraging the advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we are laying the foundation for a world-scale, competitively-advantaged, low carbon business with industry-leading returns. The planned acquisition of Denbury is a step in that direction, improving our decarbonization proposition for customers, while generating attractive returns. In summary, we're pleased with the quarter, the progress it represents and the improved earnings power of the company. We're confident that we have the right strategy with the right leadership and best people to effectively execute it, delivering sustained growth in shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Jennifer. It goes up, Doug, in short. I think as you know, and we've been talking about the reorganizations that we've been executing over the years with some of them just recently executed, puts us in a position to really capture a lot of efficiencies across the whole of the enterprise this year as we develop our corporate plans. Obviously, one of the objectives of these new organizations is to take stock of what they've got in their portfolio and identify the opportunities to further capture the benefits of scale and the synergies that exist between the integrated business and what for the first time represents an opportunity to actually manage processes across these integrated businesses. So I think we've got an opportunity set to drive that cost reduction even further as we head out further in the planned horizon. And my expectation is, when we come back at the end of the year after we've developed the plans, reviewed them with the board and then share them with all of you, we'll provide some perspective on what that opportunity looks like going forward. You bet. Thank you, Doug. Yes. Good morning, Neil. I would say that our perspective on that whole space. And I know it's one that's of great interest and we've talked about, it seems like for a number of successive quarters, hasn't really changed quite frankly. I think what we are holding ourselves to and evaluating opportunities in that space is the ability to create unique value, unique shareholder value. And so, the opportunities have to be bigger than what ExxonMobil or any potential acquisition could do independent of one another. So I think you've heard us say that one plus one has to equal three here. And that's what we are -- how we're thinking about that space. Obviously, from the very beginning, back in 2018 when we started talking about better leveraging our key competitive advantages, one of the drives to do that is to open up value opportunities that basically others can't achieve. And as I've made -- try to make clear in this quarter's prepared remarks and in previous quarters, we're making great progress on better leveraging those competitive advantages, bringing them to bear on the business, delivering bottom line results. The more we do that, the more we advance our technology portfolio, the bigger the opportunity to identify unique value opportunities with other companies. And so, we're continuing to look for that, but we're not going to compromise our expectation of generating returns and growing value for the shareholders. So I think Kathy said many times in the past, we're pretty picky acquires. I don't see us change in that position. You bet, Neil. Good morning. Yes, sure. Al, I guess maybe start by going back to the approach we outlined 2018-2019 timeframe where we said ExxonMobil can bring a different game to the unconventional space and really bring to bear and leverage the capabilities that we have versus many others who are competing in that space. And key amongst those was taking advantage of our scale and balance sheet to develop this asset at scale. And so, you may recall, we talked about the cube development, which was really focusing on how you maximize overall recovery and not near term production. That wasn't a particularly well received approach back in 2018-2019 timeframe, but I think with time, it's demonstrated its value and it's actually manifesting itself in the results that you see today, which is, we're focused on making sure that as we develop the resources and all the benches in that resources, particularly the ones that are connected, that we do that in an optimum way, that develops and maximizes the recovery versus initial production rates. And so that's really important. That cube development, we continue to evolve that. I think we've gotten to a stage now where we feel really good about how we're executing that development. We focused on capital efficiency. And I would tell you today, we are setting records for the length of our lateral wells, which, again, lowers the cost associated with accessing the resource. And importantly, as you drill longer wells, it's critical that the productivity of each foot of that well remains constant. And so, we've done a lot of work to make sure that the productivity of each foot is consistent as we drill longer and longer. So that's driving capital costs down pretty significantly. And then I would say, we've got a lot of technologies that we're trialing, ones that I won't go into specific detail on to try to match some eyes recovery. And we've got those technologies deployed in the field. We've got some early results that are quite encouraging, but they aren't at the scale today to manifest themselves completely in our results. So, I think all those things together continue to give us a lot of confidence that not only have we moved to the front of the pack and demonstrated industry leadership with what we've got today that we see a lot of upside to that as we move forward and I don't think we've reached the end of the optimization process yet. You bet. Good morning, Sam. Yes, the size of our refining business is much, much larger than our peers. So the impacts associated with the changes in those margins have a bigger impact on us than you'd see with our peers. Good morning, Roger. Yes, sure. I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. I think, first of all, what I'd say is, the work that we've done over the years to make sure that we've got a well-diversified feed slate for our chemicals business continues to pay off, particularly in these markets as things are shifting around and price spreads are moving. Our organization is pretty adopted responding to those price signals and change in feed. So that continues to make its way to the bottom line and position us better than many of our peers with that flexibility and the feed optionality that we have. I think as you look around the world, early on there was -- with China being in a COVID lockdown and recognizing the role that it has in chemicals demand. That was kind of the back half of last year. And the impact and as we've come into this year, I think a lot of expectations for China to pick up and with that growth in demand in chemicals we are seeing that starting to happen. In fact, if you look at the -- ourselves in chemicals, the second quarter was stronger than the first quarter. So we are seeing that. The demand looks pretty reasonable, I would say. I mean, the big -- that challenge and you've referenced it is the amount of supply that's come on. And that's where I think our feedstock advantages and our footprint in the integration that we have with a number of refineries around the world actually positions us better. But it'll take some time is my expectation for demand to kind of take us out of the supply, the excess supply that we've got on the marketplace, but I would just add that, we've made a lot of investment in chemicals over the last five years, fairly significant investments. And one of the things that frankly I'm quite pleased with is, if you look at all those chemical investments that we brought online, even in the depths of what is a pretty low bottom of cycle condition for our chemical business, all of those brand new projects are earnings positive and cash positive, which I think really bodes well for when the market comes back up and we're at top of cycle. So, I feel good about how we position the business and, frankly, we're doing exactly what we had hoped for, which is, when you get into tough conditions that our business continues to outperform competition. And so it puts us in a good position as markets tighten back up again and margins improve we will be in an even better position. Yes, I think what you're seeing today is a reflection of the challenge that the world faces, and frankly, an incomplete solution set. And I think unfortunately the focus, if you go back several years, and I would say the exclusive focus on wind, solar and EVs and the fact that other alternatives and other solutions that frankly at the time we were advocating for and in fact trying to develop internally weren't considered or actually -- weren't actually accepted as slowed society's progress and its emissions reductions in capturing. I think today, there's this recognition that we need more solutions and that frankly the industry can bring those solutions to bear. And at this stage of what is going to be a very complicated and expensive transition, we need as many solutions on the table as possible. Not eliminating any of them and staying focused on emissions reductions. I think that's starting to resonate. And so, I don't -- the challenge here is, this is a very nascent, the areas that we're focused on, which are the molecule oriented parts of the business that are very consistent with our capabilities and expertise and advantages, that's a -- we're in the very early stages. Frankly, we're in the lead in that space. There aren't any other companies that have secured the kind of third party mission reduction opportunities that we have that would -- there aren't any parties out there that have got the scale of the investments that we're progressing. And so, I think generally, people recognize that we're delivering on our ambition to lead the industry. And more than anything else, we are supportive. Obviously, there's a desire to make things go faster. And frankly, that's a function of the opportunity set. And if you think about the IRA and the role it plays, that legislation hasn't even been translated into regulations yet and that's going to be a critical step. And I think there are many governments around the world who are working on appropriate legislation to incentivize and create a carbon -- market for carbon that hasn't come to be yet. So there, we're very early in this process and there are a number of players in here who have a role deliver. We feel like we're delivering on our part, but there are other elements that have to come together for this to be successful. And then ultimately, we're going to need advances in technology to keep driving that cost down so that we can get to more and more diluted streams of CO2. And we're doing a lot of work in that space. And frankly, again, I think our pipeline of opportunities, our technology pipeline, I feel pretty good about it. And I hope to, in the next several years to hopefully commercialize some technologies to further reduce the cost of emissions reductions. So I think early, a lot of work going on. I think we're making a lot of good progress and we feel good about the role that we're playing in the leadership position that we have. That is better. That's better, Sam. Welcome back. Yes. So I would say, obviously, that's the core business today of Denbury and had facilitated infrastructure that they have in place. That frankly for us was not a key driver, strategic driver of the opportunity. I think EOR certainly in the short term can play a role. But if you think about the broader opportunity, it's really around carbon capture storage, sequestration and keeping the carbon under the ground. So that's the longer term play for us. I mean, as I just commented here about the challenges with the regulation and the translation of the IRA into regulation, we've got Class 6 well Permian, that's going to be required for sequestration. That's a fairly slow progress to date. So, there's a lot of work that has to go into putting these pieces together so that we're successful. I see EOR as providing a lot of optionality in the short term that as we're bringing on carbon capture facilities, working with third parties and we start capturing the CO2. If we don't have everything lined up on the sequestration side, the EOR gives us an opportunity to progress these things and not lose schedules. So, I think right now that's the way I would think about it. It's certainly not a strategic thrust for us as a company. You bet. Thank you. Yes, sure. And thanks for the questions. That's something that frankly the organization has spent decades kind of working. I'll start by just -- I bucket it in three distinct buckets. First, it starts with the design and build out of the project itself. And so, having a projects organization with the capability that we've built and strengthened here over the last several years, we end up with facilities that have the right design and are built the right way so that we've got a really good platform to optimize and a good opportunity to squeeze to find opportunities to maximize and optimize the production coming out of the facilities without compromising any of the design specifications, staying well within safe operating envelopes. And we've done that over the years in a lot of our facilities. And I think this project organization even extends that capability with the skills that they bring to the project development and the build out. And then I'd say the second bucket is our operations organization and the focus that they put on maximizing utilization and production. And I think the mindset in the company is, once you've got steel on the ground, you've got this capital. The operations job is to run it reliably, run it safely, run it in an environmentally responsible way, but at the same time maximize the value of that steel in the ground and they've done a tremendous job of that. And it's not one big thing. It's a lot of little things that that organization stays focused on and pushes. And again, we've seen that not only in Guyana, but really all the capital projects that we've been bringing on the organization done a great job of making sure that we're maximizing the value of the capital that we've invested. And then the third bucket I would say is our technology organization. And again, we've taken the step to consolidate all of our technology organizations and move from what was a business oriented construct to a capabilities construct. And so, we've got our best people brought together working on our biggest opportunities. It's really driving innovation and creativity. And this close partnership that technology now has with the business and the shared commitment to drive value leads to more technology getting out in the field and assisting the operations group and squeezing. So I'd say all those are coming together. My expectation is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, we're going to see the first two FPSOs get above 400,000 barrels a day as we continue to optimize and we'll do that in a very safe and environmentally responsible way. My expectation is when the third boat comes on with [indiscernible], we'll see similar levels of improvement there. And frankly, the expectation that we have for ourselves is that, as we build -- go forward and continue to build these projects, we'll continue to find the same kind of benefits and optimization opportunities with the projects and it comes back to this inherent capability that we built into our businesses. You bet. I'll let Kathy maybe dive into a little more detail. I would just say, with respect to pricing and the impact on the business, actually our quarter came in pretty much in line with what we had expected. If you looked at the 8-K that we put out and our best attempt to model the impact. Just from the market environment, we are pretty rigorous in making sure that when we put an 8-K out there, it's really focused on discrete planned events, but much more importantly on what the market impact has been to the business quarter-on-quarter. And so I think that kind of laid out pretty consistently with what we expected. Obviously, gas prices were down, but I think refining margins are down a bit but still in very healthy territory. And if you look at the fundamentals, quite frankly, as we head into the back half of the year, I think as demand picks up, we're going to see limits that we have on additional supply, I think, come back into the mix and see the supply/demand tighten up a bit. So, my expectation is, the back half of the year, we'll see some an upward pressure just given demand changes in the limited options we have to significantly increase supply. Kathy, anything to add to that? Sure. Yes. Maybe I'll just come back to kind of the fundamentals of how we think about ExxonMobil's participation in the transition space. And it comes back to the focus on leveraging the advantages that we have as a corporation where we believe we can add unique value. That's why we have, since the very beginning, stayed focused on what I'd say is the molecule side of the equation in carbon capture and hydrogen and biofuels. But we're looking at, frankly, all the areas that we believe we have an expertise and a unique capability and seeing if there's a fit for products or solutions that can help society decarbonize. Lithium and production of lithium from brine water is, if you think about what's required to do that is really an extension of a lot of the current capabilities that we have in our upstream. It requires a good understanding of the subsurface, requires a good understanding of reservoir management, requires drilling and injections. And so, I think the below surface things are very much in line with the skills and capabilities that we've built out over the decades in our upstream business. The processing of the brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries and chemical plants and in fact, in some of our upstream operations. So that piece of the equation is, again, not new to the company. So as you look at all that, I think the capability, the skill set that we have, the operating experience that we have all lend themselves to that. And then, of course, there's the question of how does the market fundamentals look and supply and demand? And do we see a role for what we're doing there? And frankly, we've been looking at that for quite some time. I'd say we're still early in evaluating the opportunity, but we believe that by, again, applying our advantages in this space that we can bring on a much needed resource, lithium, one that's predicted to go short, we can bring it on at a much lower cost. And I think importantly, with much less environmental impact versus, say, the open mining that they're doing in other parts of the world. So this, to us, feels like a potential win-win-win opportunity, a win using our capabilities, a win from an environmental impact standpoint and a win in terms of supplying markets with a crucial component to electrification and EV. So, I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And we're, I'd say, actively exploring that opportunity set and like what we're seeing so far. You bet. And just maybe to emphasize the point a third time that Kathy made, the mandate to the businesses is find advantaged projects that position us ahead of competition and deliver high returns, high value. And that's the mandate they've been given. And we will fund those opportunities as they come forward. I think what you see in terms of the -- what limits the investment is the ability, those opportunities -- to manifest those opportunities. And I think it's the challenge that we give our organization to only fund the things that we feel confident are robust to a very low price environment, are well ahead of other companies and tap into what I would say are the fundamental -- long-term fundamentals of the market. I think as we find those things and the organization is very focused on developing those opportunity set, we'll fund them because that's how you generate long-term value for the corporation and our shareholders. Good morning, Paul. Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think as you rightly point out, the Denbury acquisition was not part of the $17 billion. And maybe just a little bit of perspective on that, given the we're just starting that business up, as you can imagine, very early and the opportunity set and progressing the opportunity set. I think Dan and his team in the Low Carbon Solutions business have made tremendous progress in bringing those opportunities to bear and manifesting contracts with customers as we've talked about with the three big customers that we now have and demonstrating that we can decarbonize some of these hard-to-decarbonize industries that don't have a lot of good alternatives. We've also got a very significant investment opportunity in Baytown to bring on the world's largest hydrogen plant. And then we've got opportunities for low carbon ammonia associated with that. So I think a pretty robust portfolio. And with the announcements of the deals that we've got to date, the commercial deals that we struck with the announcement of Denbury, I think a lot of recognition and interest by outside potential customers that there's a real opportunity here and that ExxonMobil provides a real solution. So that's the context. I would say the $17 billion as we -- that was -- looking at a portfolio of opportunities and then trying to assess how those -- how quickly those opportunities would manifest themselves in the capital that'd be required to do that, we're continuing that work. There's a lot -- and so as we continue to develop and make progress on these projects, some of the capital becomes more discrete, and we can see it a lot clearer, other deals move out. And so I'd say right now, it's a portfolio approach. We're not changing the $17 billion to date. Frankly, the Denbury acquisition, if that goes through, will allow us to pull back on some of the grassroots investments that we were making in logistics and substitute that with the assets that we brought in from Denbury. So it's, I'd say, kind of an evolving space. I think the thing to stay focused on, we're not going to compromise on our return criteria or the advantaged criteria that we're insisting on for the projects that we bring to bear. We have to be low-cost suppliers in this space. We have to be leveraging the advantages the corporation has, and we have to be generating good competitive returns. That's going to dictate the pace of the -- how quickly that CapEx manifests itself and frankly, the size of it. And as we go through this year's plan, I know Dan and his team are very focused on based on a year -- having a year under their belt of continuing to execute and drive this business. We'll develop more detailed plans and update that number. I don't know, Kathy, do you have anything you want to add for Paul? You bet, Paul. Yes. Sure, Paul, I'll take that. If you think about the first quarter, we were up pretty significantly, second quarter down from that first quarter, but essentially on plan with respect to the full year production levels that we talked about at the back end of last year when we put our plan forward. And I would tell you that there's nothing that we're seeing today that changes that guidance that we gave last year at 3.7 million barrels a day of production. So I'd say we're on track with that. We're not seeing anything that makes us change our mind. And obviously, we're working real hard to do better than that. But I would say, right now, we feel like we're on track to meet the plan and meet the numbers that we shared earlier last year. Thank you, Paul."

            "content": "Doug, I tell you to go back to the Investor Day materials from March of 2022. We had some bridges in it where we kind of laid out earnings and how much structural cost savings we're driving, earnings improvement relative to volume and mix. And I think if you just look at the size of those bars, you'll get a rough order of magnitude. Yes. I wouldn't say there's anything unique. I mean, this is a straight flow through of just what the industry refining margin reduction is kind of flowing through. We would see a much bigger reduction coming out of where we have a bigger footprint. So I would say even though the US tends to have better margins than the rest of the world, we obviously have a very big footprint in the US. And so, just that footprint drives a bigger absolute number and absolute decline, but it's just a straight flow through from the change in industry margins. Good morning. And I would add a couple of quick stats to that. So relative to competition, again, our geographic footprint is pretty advantaged. And so, we're about 35% larger in North America than, I'll call it, rest of industry. And then the other thing I'd point out that gets to what Darren just said about some of the projects we've been implementing, those projects helped to support an improvement in our overall mix. And so, this quarter, we saw a 6% increase in performance chemical products and those carry a higher margin. So those are some of the more systemic things that help to drive improvement relative to competitors. Good morning, Ryan. Yes. I'll mention a couple of other things to you. As a result of some of the divestments we've done over the past year, if you look at our gas portfolio, we're now about 45% LNG, so a little bit more tipped to LNG. If you just look at kind of impact of pricing across our gas portfolio and results, I mean, Henry Hub was down about 40%. TTF was down almost 50%. And the last thing I'd say is we always talk about the fact that on LNG a lot of our contracts are tied to lagged oil prices. And so, if you just look at where oil prices were in the fourth quarter kind of relative to where they are more currently, I'm going to call them down roughly $10 a barrel. And so, that pricing impact would have flowed through as well. And then the last thing that I will mention associated with our trading results is, if you exclude mark-to-market, so if you look in upstream, mark-to-market was a positive for us in the quarter. But if you exclude it mark-to-market, I would have then said our gas trading results were a little bit lighter this quarter. So kind of all of that packaged together, I think, gives you a pretty good understanding of our gas results. Sure. And so, we're pretty happy with our overall balance sheet position right now. And I've stated for a couple of quarters now that we expect our cash balance is going to ebb and flow a little bit just based on how the commodity price environment and margin environment ebbs and flows. So we think it's pretty critical to hang on to a really strong balance sheet because it gives us the flexibility that we need through the cycle. If you look overall at what we're doing from an investment perspective, I would say we're never trying to constrain the organization in terms of deploying good capital investments. And that's across our entire business. It includes our LCS business. Obviously, the acquisition of Denbury will enable us to accelerate the growth of our carbon capture and sequestration business within LCS. And we're excited about that opportunity and profitably growing that part of our business. So I think it's really important when we talk about capital deployment that we are not trying to constrain the company from new capital projects that can drive good returns for our shareholders. And that's how we create, I'd say, the virtuous cycle of how we can then support competitive growing dividends that are sustainable over the long term and a more consistent share repurchase program. So I'd say we're really happy with our balance sheet. We intend to hang on to a higher cash balance than the company has done historically just to give us more flexibility as we think about how we manage the company over the long term and through the cycles. Yes. I mean, the way that we're thinking about inflation and whether it's oilfield services costs or other costs across the business, I'd say we've gone to a point where we're actually starting to see inflation come off in certain cost categories. If you think about some of the chemicals that we would use in unconventional, things like sand, what we would call tubular goods, which would include piping and valves and those types of things, we're starting to see some deflationary pressure now. As it relates to things where labor is a high component of the cost, I would say, we're not yet necessarily seeing that deflationary pressure coming through yet. But overall, I'd say it's probably too early to see much of that come through the second half of the year. But as we're looking forward into 2024, I'd say we fundamentally feel like inflation is going to come off as we're looking forward, because we're starting to see those signs across multiple categories now throughout the business. Yes. Just the other thing I want to mention is, especially as it relates to the CCS business, what you're going to see over time is that, we're building a backlog. And that backlog is what's going to support the future growing CapEx kind of over the longer term and the profitable growth of that business. So today, I would describe ExxonMobil's backlog is 5 million tons annually, supported by three very large industrial customers, one in the industrial gas sector, one in the steel sector, one that makes ammonia that's used for fertilizer, right? And if you just think about what that does for society, those 5 million tons annually, that translates into the conversion of about 2 million cars from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. That's about all the cars around the road in the United States today. And when we talk about the overall CCS opportunity across the Gulf Coast, we talk about 100 million tons annually. That's 20 times that number. But I'm going to go back to the fact that it will be supported by customer backlog that supports a growing profitable business. So that's how you should think about it. Of course. 620 koebd. Yes. I'll just mention, we had given a bit of guidance to divestment and scheduled downtime. And that guidance was that we thought we'd see a reduction of about 110 koebd as I said what the actuals were across both of those items. It was actually 120 koebd, and that's a sequential number. So we were down sequentially 120 koebd as a result of divestments and the scheduled downtime. If you then just look at why was our overall production down a little bit more than that, it was really driven by two things. So we've seen curtailments and obviously, OPEC is cutting production, and so we have an impact coming from that. And then in terms of unscheduled downtime, we had a short strike in Nigeria that tipped up our unscheduled downtime. But again, I would go back to what Darren said, we had guided for the full year at about 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels a day. And if you look at our year-to-date numbers, we're up about 15,000 on a year-to-date basis year-over-year. Yes. No, Beaumont is the main thing. And then we obviously had a bit less maintenance kind of going on, which helped our volumes as well. I'd mention that Beaumont was running at 90% utilization. So again, a really nice, I think, proof point and just the operational excellence across the company."

And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJennifer Driscoll: Good morning. Welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the new Investor Relations section of our website. They're meant to accompany the first quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will provide opening comments and reference a few slides from this presentation. That will give analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at 8:30 A.M. Central Time. During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We describe some of them in our cautionary statement here on slide 2. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs available on our website for investors. Also, please note that we provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. And now please turn to slide 3 for Darren's remarks.\nDarren Woods: Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Following a record year, ExxonMobil delivered the highest first quarter earnings in our history even as energy prices and refining margins moderated from the fourth quarter. This ongoing success reflects the hard work of our people, executing our strategic priorities and fully leveraging our competitive advantages. Through investments in advantaged assets, mix improvements and cost and operating discipline, we are delivering the structural earnings improvements outlined in our corporate plan update last December and expanding the energy supplies needed to meet growing global demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we added about 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to global supply, primarily from a 40% increase in production from Guyana in the Permian Basin, increase more than offset our divestments in the expropriation of Sakhalin-1, which we no longer account for, but which importantly remains part of global supply. In addition, our Beaumont refinery expansion reached nameplate capacity in the quarter. This 250,000 barrel a day expansion is the largest US refinery addition in a decade, helping meet society's ongoing need for transportation fuels. Guyana, we're pleased to announce that we reached final investment decisions for Uaru, fifth offshore project, which will bring on even more production from this low-cost, low-carbon intensity resource. Uaru will provide an additional 250,000 barrels a day of gross capacity with start-up targeted for 2026. Earnings in our Product Solutions business benefited from the team's solid operational execution with top quartile turnaround cost and schedule performance during a particularly heavy planned maintenance period. Low Carbon Solutions, we're building momentum across several fronts. In early April, we announced a long-term agreement with Linde to capture, transport and permanently store up to 2.2 million metric tons CO2 annually. Hydrogen, we announced front-end engineering and design contract for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen facility in Baytown, ahead of agreement with SK Group of Korea for offtake of blue ammonia from that facility. As we said during our Low Carbon Solutions spotlight earlier this month, our low carbon projects must be advantaged and deliver competitive returns. The ability of our low-carbon projects to compete successfully for capital is important if the world is going to meet its emissions aspirations. Incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act are a positive step forward, although permitting and other regulatory improvements are still needed. Europe, by contrast, policy approach remains far more prescriptive and punitive. This is true whether we're talking about the emissions reductions needed to put the world on a path to net-zero or the production needed to provide Europe with affordable and reliable energy. The progress we're making across the company is underpinned by the continuing evolution of our business model. Effective on May 1, two new enterprise-wide organizations will be up and running. Global Business Solutions will centralize the majority of our finance procurement operations, enabling us to deliver simplified corporate-wide processes. ExxonMobil Supply Chain will consolidate supply chain activities globally. The organizations will focus on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies, improve operating and financial results and, importantly, deliver an improved experience for customers, vendors and our people. On June 1, we plan to launch our new enterprise-wide trading organization. Global Trading will bring together expertise from across the company in crude, products, natural gas, power and marine freight trading, plan to build on our record 2022 results, leveraging the unique insights we gain from participating across each of our value chains and all along their entire length, with a global operating footprint larger than any of our competitors. Now, let me cover the quarter's headlines. We're pleased to have delivered $11.4 billion of earnings, a record first quarter following a record year. A significant contributing factor was structural cost savings that now total approximately $7.2 billion, keeps us on track to meet our target of $9 billion by the end of this year. Cash flow from operations totaled $16.3 billion, and our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to 4%, further increasing the strength of our balance sheet, while supporting shareholder distributions of $8.1 billion in the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends. Biodynamic market, our underlying performance remains rock solid and well ahead of our competition, reflecting the many improvements we've made over the last six years and, of course, the hard work of our people. Our diverse portfolio of advantaged businesses, improvements in mix, structural cost savings, excellence in execution are driving industry-leading earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we have the capability to win across a wide variety of market conditions to deliver strong returns, while meeting the evolving needs of society, including the need to reduce emissions. Leveraging the capabilities and advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we're building an advantaged new business, Low Carbon Solutions, which is positioning us as a leader in the energy transition, in our own and other's emissions and establishing long-term value-accretive growth opportunities that will underpin continued growth in shareholder returns. With that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer.\nJennifer Driscoll: Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to Q&A. As a courtesy to other analysts, please limit yourself to a single question. That way we can accommodate more questions from more people. Also, please remain on the line in case we need to ask any clarifying questions. With that, operator, please open up the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. Thank you question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you so much. Darren, you spent a lot of time in the refining business over the years, and you've had a perspective on these calls. And margins were going to start to normalize, and we're seeing some indication of that. I'd just be curious on your views on what you're seeing in terms of product demand? And then how do you think it's going to manifest itself in -- through the refining system from a margin perspective over the next couple of years? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Good morning Neil. A couple of points, I think as we're looking at the refining margin. Obviously, the first I would make is we don't really pride ourselves on being able to forecast margins. So, our caveat, everything I say with the recognition that given the impact that demand has on the margins, given the fairly static supply side of the equation, it's often difficult to know exactly where things are going to go. What I would say is as you look at where we're at today, I mean, this is seasonally a low point as you head into second quarter and third quarter and driving season when you tend to see supply and demand tighten up and margins improve, you typically see early in the year a lot of refining turnarounds, which take a lot of capacity off-line in that lower demand season. And then when those turnarounds are finished and capacity comes back out, you get a surge of supply. And so you generally see refining margins drop off here in kind of this valley between the supply coming back and then demand picking up as you head into early summer and on to the year. So, I think we're in -- that's important context in terms of what we're seeing right now. Gasoline demand looks pretty reasonable, frankly. I think jet demand and transportation looks like it's kind of trending up and certainly from listening to some of our customers in that space, expectations of a fairly healthy air transportation or airline travel miles going forward in the summer. So, I think in my view is we're going to see the typical push up in the summer and see margins rise longer term. So, it comes back to what happens in China. It has been a source of not only demand but also of exports. There, exports have been higher in the first quarter, but it depends to see how those play out going forward. If we see similar levels of exports as we saw last year, my expectation is that will put additional upward pressure on the margin. So, I think that's kind of the things to watch. The last point I'd make on refining margins, which I think is somewhat structural, typically, the marginal barrel in refining comes out of Europe. And so then Europe set -- is the price setter for global markets ex-transportation. We've got high gas prices in Europe with, I think, the potential to go higher. You've got high carbon prices in Europe. And so that marginal tier of production is a lot more expensive than it's been historically. And that's going to keep, I think, pressure on higher prices for the globe and therefore better margins if you're producing outside of Europe.\nNeil Mehta: Okay, Darren. Thanks so much.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nDarren Woods: Hi, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Darren, I wonder if I could kick off first on disposals, another reasonable contribution from non-core asset sales. Can you characterize where you are in that process and what you think you might have still in front of you in terms of non-core asset sales. And I've got a quick follow-up, please.\nDarren Woods: Sure, Doug. Good morning. Well, I think if you look at the plans we set ourselves, I think, back in 2018 where we talked about, particularly in the Upstream, increasing our divestments and taking a very thoughtful approach there, making sure that we were positioning ourselves that when the market was right and we had interest from buyers, that we had assets ready to sell and divest has worked fairly well. We've been, I think, pretty successful at consistently putting assets in the market and realizing the value of those. We should hit the objective that we set back in 2018 probably sometime this year. And then we've got -- as we continue to work on high grading the portfolio, continue to look at assets that we don't see are strategic necessarily or where we see a potential value -- higher value for others, we'll continue to feed that divestment portfolio and market those assets. So my expectation is we've got an inventory of things going forward and would expect to see, in my mind, kind of consistent rate of being out in the market and basically finding -- seeing if we can find buyers who have a higher use for the assets than we do and therefore better value and therefore decent base. I'd just make the final point that as we look at the divestments, it is a value proposition. We are comfortable with everything we've got in the portfolio. It's really a question of how do we optimize and maximize the value and that's been the focus from the very beginning and continue to be one. So we're not -- we don't have to sell anything. It's only if we find a valuable opportunity to do that.\nDoug Leggate: I appreciate the answer. I think I couldn't remember if Jennifer said one question or one plus one follow-up. So I'll risk a follow-up very quickly. I'll delicately ask this question, if I may. Obviously, Kathy was on the wires this morning talking about how picky Exxon would be on M&A. I just want to ask you if you feel that you need to backfill your Permian position at any time in the future. And I'll leave you there. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Okay. Doug, I'll give you this one plus one. Look, it amazes me that the amount of questions that come up in this space, I think we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about it. We're always looking for an opportunity for an acquisition and one that grows value. And it's got to be value accretive. It's got to be one where -- what Exxon Mobil brings to the table actually increases what either company would do independent of one another. And so that's kind of, I'd say, the underlying approach. While we're in a depletion business, and we've got to work real hard to continue to bring volume on it, we're not actually in the market to find volume. We're in the market to find value. And we're willing to kind of let volumes do what they will do in the search for making sure that anything that we bring into the portfolio is accretive and is a unique value contribution for the shareholders. And so I mean, we're working really hard on our technology portfolio in the Permian. I've talked about that in the past. My view is success in technology and developing proprietary technology, which improves either resource recovery or the cost of developing that resource, whatever that is, whatever value lever our technology can bring to the table, that obviously opens up deal space. And to the extent that we are very active in the Permian, we've got a really good anchor business there, and we're working real hard on opening up the value proposition of our current acreage with technology, that will open up potentially opportunities for acquisitions. But that's down the road. That's work that we've got to demonstrate to ourselves. There is a unique value proposition there. And then my view would be we'll leverage that to the full extent that we can. But I'd make the same -- that's true for any of the areas of our portfolio where we've got a substantial business today and ongoing technology work to make advances. That's, I think, really what's going to underpin where we focus our attention.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you.\nJennifer Driscoll: And as a reminder, we would like you to limit yourself to single question. Thanks.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nDarren Woods: Good morning.\nDevin McDermott: So I want to stick with the Permian, but I'm not going to ask an M&A question, I wanted to ask about the results you're seeing there. And if you look at the production in the quarter, you guys reported 615,000 barrels a day. It's a strong sequential growth versus 4Q and also puts you already in line with that 10% growth target that you had laid out for 2023. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the productivity trends and the driver of the strong results that you're seeing there, and then also how you're thinking about the evolution of production for the balance of this year?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, good morning. I would say we haven't changed our year-end targets, and so the guidance that we gave as part of the corporate plan discussion last year continues to hold. I think we've said in the past that as you look at production in the Permian, it's going to be a little bit lumpy. And so I wouldn't take any one data point, any one quarter's numbers and extrapolate from there. I think you're going to see moving that up and down. I would say, generally speaking, we like what we're seeing in terms of productivity in the Permian. You all know we -- several years ago, our strategy on maximizing oil recovery versus initial production rates that led to a very different development approach trying to work across this cube design, work across all the benches simultaneously to maximize ultimate recovery. That, I think we've been developing that approach, fine tuning it, testing it and evolving that concept. We like where we've gotten to with that approach. I think we're seeing the results of that starting to manifest itself. Our expectation is that we'll continue to, I think, differentiate our production and what we're able to do versus many of the others -- many of our other competitors who started off on this best bench, high initial production rates. With time, I expect to see them pivot maybe a similar approach, but I think we've got a real good head start on that. Like what we're doing there. I think we see some encouraging signs on the early stages of that. And we're going to keep pressing on that, maintain rigs and the capital levels that we've been talking about pretty consistently, and then we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. But we're sticking at this point to same year-end guidance that we gave late last year.\nDevin McDermott: Great. Thanks, Darren.\nDarren Woods: Welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nDarren Woods: Good morning.\nJohn Royall: So on the Beaumont expansion, can you talk about how the capacity is being absorbed in the market? And given what's happened to cracks and the general concerns around demand today and granted, I think, Darren's commentary on the market was probably a bit more positive, but are there any concerns about adding capacity at a time where fundamentals appear to be weakening?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I would say the short answer is, no. Look, we all know these markets are volatile, that they move up and down. We focused, I'll remind you, on the Beaumont expansion. This is something that we began planning and developing many, many years ago. And it was really built on the Permian production and the changes and transportation differentials by bringing crude into the front end of the Beaumont refinery and making the intermediate products to fill our conversion capacity and backing out imports of intermediates and saving the transportation of those intermediates that are typically coming from afar. And so, we justified that project on a transportation differential and felt that, that provided a reasonable return, and with the expectation that on top of that, we would see the value of additional fuels and the higher-value products that we are producing, exactly what we're seeing today. It is very well positioned on the cost of supply curve. And frankly, that's how you need to think about this business. So irrespective of where the margins go, our view is all of our facilities need to be on the far left of the curve, so that we've got a difference between the marginal price setter. And I have every expectation that the capacity that we brought on in Beaumont will -- I know is on the far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so feel pretty good about its competitiveness.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\nSam Margolin: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Sam.\nSam Margolin: So, I think, looking at the numbers, what sort of jumps off the page is the cash balance. And you've been pretty transparent about this topic and you know the imperative to build a fortress balance sheet. But I wonder if the direction we're going with cash, even net of shareholder returns that are continuing to increase and that are well within sort of your targets, if we're kind of getting beyond fortress and into something even bigger than that. And if there's any thought around kind of the absolute level of cash today and really what's optimal. And I think, I'll just -- I'll catch that with historically, Exxon had kept a very lean balance sheet on both sides relative to sort of the production base and the cash flow base. And so, it's a little bit different than the history of the company, and so I would appreciate your thoughts on it. Thank you.\nKathy Mikells: Sure. I'll go ahead and take that, Sam. I mean, our capital allocation approach, I think, has been very consistent and very clear. And we had talked about the fact that we would expect our cash balance post the end of the year to kind of ebb and flow depending on how market prices and margins evolve. So I'd say we're very comfortable with where we stand. It's important for us to have a really strong balance sheet in order to ensure that we stick to our capital allocation priorities through the cycle, right? That's investing in the business and competitively advantaged high-return projects. It's maintaining a very strong balance sheet. You know that balance sheet gives us all the firepower and confidence we need to succeed across a very wide variety of market conditions, which is obviously what this industry faces. And then clearly, we're looking to share our success with shareholders, and you see that through a more consistent share repurchase program and a growing dividend. So, we feel pretty good about our cash balance. I would just also mention that we're in a relatively unusual market environment compared to what we've seen in the past. ExxonMobil's average debt rate is about 3%. You can look up what people are earning on short-term cash. I think three-month treasuries are at 5% today. So, right now, we're not incurring a negative cost of carry on that cash balance, and that's certainly one of the things that we look at as well. So, we feel really good about where we're at today in our balance sheet.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And I would add, Sam, I think you mentioned history. And in recent history, it's certainly true that we ran fairly lean on cash. But if you go further back to some of the really high cycles, we carried more cash and it reflected the commodity cycle and the nature that typically we're bringing a lot of cash on the top of the commodity cycle. But that's an important asset as you move into the bottom of the cycle, particularly when you're trying to maintain the consistent investment levels and continue to advance the projects in the portfolio. So, I think -- and time from the markets are on the high end of the cycle, I would expect to see cash balances higher so that we're well positioned as we go into the low end of the cycle, which we know will come. Question is obviously when that will come.\nSam Margolin: Thank you so much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Thank you. Good morning.\nDarren Woods: Good morning Roger.\nRoger Read: What I'd like to ask on the specific commentary about the $7.2 billion in savings on track for the $9 billion this year. Could you characterize a little bit where that's come from to-date, how kind of general inflation within not just the oil field but in general, how that's affecting that? And is $9 billion, like is that the end of the program, or is there something to happen beyond that? I know I'm kind of asking three questions in one, but they're all focused right around the $7 billion to $9 billion. So, if you allow me, I'll throw that out.\nKathy Mikells: I'll try and circle around that kind of suite of questions for you, Roger. So, I'd start by saying, overall, we feel really good about the progress that we've made. We're very much on track for the $9 billion at the end of this year relative to 2019. If you look overall at where a number of, I'd say, different programs are driving savings for us, one is just improving the overall productivity across our workforce. If you think about how that's manifested itself in Upstream, it's been a significant reduction in what I would describe as above-field cost that's been a real focus of that organization. We've made a number of different organizational changes over the past couple of years, I would describe those generally as looking to centralize kind of key functions across the company that have been done disparately. Previously, our global projects organization would be a great example of that. Last year, more recently, the combination of our Upstream -- I'm sorry, our Downstream and Chem organization into our Product Solutions business, a lot of simplification coming across that business as a result, combining our engineering and research kind of groups collectively together and then just recently announcing the combination of our supply chain across the organization and setting up a global business services organization and combining our global trading capabilities across the company. And so that's all about improving the experience for our employees, for our vendors, for our customers and continuing to drive efficiencies and importantly, effectiveness across those organizations. We would have seen actually the benefit of some of that in this recent quarter. We talked a little bit in our presentation about the fact that our maintenance activities, we had a pretty heavy turnaround quarter, and those maintenance activities really came in at the first quartile. So much better than what we had planned for, shorter duration. That enabled us obviously to have better throughput than we would have been planning overall for the quarter. And so that's a big area of savings for us. And that's another organization that we have recently centralized in our global operations and sustainability group. So that gives you, I'd say, a little bit of a characterization of where savings are coming from. And certainly, some of the more recent changes that we've made in the organization, we'd expect to drive efficiencies and effectiveness going forward from here. And then just the last comment, like does the program end. So just to be clear, we've talked about a specific time period externally because we thought that would be helpful in transparency. Internally, we don't actually manage this as, hey, there's onetime period that we're focused on as opposed to we are focused on continuing to drive structural cost savings over time. Those are embedded in the plans that we shared with you last December. And obviously, we'll be doing an update when we come to the end of the year. And so we'll talk in more detail about what we see from there on a go-forward basis.\nDarren Woods: And the final point I'd make to build on what Kathy said is we have seen with all these organizational changes, as our people have come together the new organizations and focused on the objectives of those organizations and what the corporation is trying to achieve, we find a lot more opportunities than we could envision even going in to the changes. So my expectation is as these new organizations come together, they'll begin to find things. The organizational changes we've already made are continuing to find things. So our expectation as we head into the future is we'll continue to drive efficiencies and deliver structural cost savings on to the bottom line.\nKathy Mikells: And then I'll just circle back. You asked a little bit about inflation. We actually have put an additional disclosure in our press release, so I'd encourage you to look at that. If you look at the quarter, we more than offset inflationary cost pressure with the structural savings that we were able to generate. Overall, I'd say, the organization is doing a good job at looking to offset inflation in what's obviously been a higher inflation environment recently.\nRoger Read: Thank you.\nKathy Mikells: Welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on the Downstream business and given your global reach there, we're seeing reports that Asian refiners are contemplating run cuts while margins in the US are still really robust. And I'm wondering if you see that dynamic has kind of balanced where cracks in Asia are zero but margins in the US are still 20, and that's kind of representative of the market structure that we're in, or do you expect the weakness in Asia margins to force US refining margins lower in the near-term? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Yeah, sure, I'll take that. I think the first comment I would make is over some period of time, and it's typically pretty short, the world balances. And we always use the phrase of the world as round. So it's hard to stay disconnected with -- the margins eventually have to equilibrate on transportation differentials. And so that's the model that I have in my mind. There are always short-term disruptions. You certainly saw that coming out of the pandemic with some of the logistics constraints. So there will obviously be periods of time where things constrain that. But generally speaking, that happens. I think the margins in the US will be a function of what production source is setting the marginal layer of production. As I said earlier, that has historically come out of Europe. And there, cost structures have increased, and so that marginal barrel is now higher, which is underpinning higher Gulf Coast refining. I don't frankly see that changing in the short-term. Obviously, if additional capacity comes on, it's much lower cost. And that supply overwhelms any growth in demand, and we'll see the marginal price that are changed. And then with time, that will get balanced out based on transportation differentials. My sense of things is if you look back to last year and the export levels coming out of China and the balances in Asia that stayed reasonably tight. The question will be, do we see the same thing this year. And I think time will tell.\nJason Gabelman: All right. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Richardson: Hi, thanks. This maybe a bit of a follow-up on the questions previously about cost structure and the balance sheet. But I was wondering, Darren, if you could just address how and remind us how you're thinking about dividend growth, right? Because we've got clear evidence here that you've got foundational earnings growth. You've got projects that are coming on sooner and bigger if you look at Guyana, the Permian is doing well. You're adding base capacity downstream. So just wondering if you could remind us on a mid-cycle basis how to think about -- and how the Board thinks about dividend growth, because certainly, you've derisked some of those foundational earnings?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Kathy to build on, but I would just say, generally, as we think about the dividend, we try to keep the long-term in mind and also be extremely conscious of the commodity cycles and the variability and the volatility that we see in the marketplace and making sure that we establish a level of dividends that are reliable, sustainable, and I'd like to see those grow with time. That's been our history. That's what you've seen us do. And you see us fight certainly during the pandemic year fight really hard to make sure that we sustain that. And that's, I think, a commitment that I feel really strong about. And so it's really about making sure that what we do there is sustainable for the long-term. And then obviously, we can balance disbursement -- shareholder disbursements with buybacks. But I think maintaining a long-term perspective and making sure our shareholders feel rewarded through the dividend policy is an underlying principle. Kathy, do you want to add anything to that?\nKathy Mikells: Yeah, I'd say we look to take a very balanced approach as we think about shareholder distributions and getting that balance between a growing competitive dividend, right, as well as the efficiency through share repurchases. And I think we're striking a pretty even balance in that regard. And we definitely think about this over the long term as opposed to the near term, given we're in a business that's highly cyclical. And so, you've seen us in the last two years raise the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year. We're never going to get out in front of the Board of Directors. It's obviously something that we look at regularly, and we know it's important to ensure that dividend competitive and growing. And about 40% of our shareholders are retail shareholders, so more of the moms and pops across the globe that are investors. And so we know it's important. It's something we're really focused on.\nStephen Richardson: Thank you, very much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Great. Thanks. Maybe a question on the chemicals business. You saw sequential margin improvement in your chemicals products business driven by advantaged ethane pricing. Have we turned the corner in the chemicals environment? And can you talk about how you see the trajectory of margins in that business over the course of 2023?\nDarren Woods: Sure. I'll start then and then, Kathy, if you got anything to add to it. I think, these -- like all the businesses that we're in, the underlying drivers of the chemical margins tend to be the commodity chemicals that are driven by supply/demand and the balances or imbalances in supply/demand. The margin, we saw a lot of capacity come on. You remember, as we went through the pandemic, a lot of investments got stalled and pulled back. And then as we came out, those got turned back on again and have come on to the marketplace. We've seen a lot of capacity coming on. I expect we'll still see some of that come on here in the short term. And then in conjunction with that, the COVID impacts took a while for it to unwind through, what I'd say, is the global economy, which impacted chemical demand. As you know, it's very tied to economic activity. So if economic activity is constrained, then chemical demand is constrained. And we certainly saw that with the China lockdowns. Where we're at now is, that capacity is out there and on and it's just a question of where demand goes. And frankly, I think it's early with China. We do see some promising signs, but we'll have to see how that -- China demand and their economic activity picks up. The other point I would make is, feed and feed optimization is a big part of the margin equation as well. We've got some fairly diverse assets with respect to the ability to manage feed and change feedstocks around. As gas prices came off, that gave us a better liquid to gas spread that allowed us to change some of our feed into our crackers and get the advantage of that. So that was a help in the first quarter, some of that feed optimization. And that will play into it as well. And I think that's what you saw in the first quarter. And then the more macro impacts, we'll see how they play out as we go forward. Kathy, anything?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. The only other thing I'd add is, we obviously brought on our Baton Rouge chemical expansion project late in the fourth quarter. That's spooled up in quarter. That's part of an overall strategy of growing Performance Chemicals along with growing high-value products across our Product Solutions business, be it performance chemicals or full emission fuels, high-value lubes. And so, even though the market has been tough, that project actually had a positive earnings and cash flow contribution for us in the quarter. So that's a big part of our overall strategy and mixing up in both the Chemical business and across our Product Solutions business. And we feel very good about the results that's bringing. And we obviously have a very heavy US Gulf Coast footprint kind of relative to the global footprint, and that helped us in the sequential improvement in margins.\nDarren Woods: Yes. It's a great example of where we're focused on, advantaged projects that bring on advantaged low-cost capacity. So, that polypropylene unit that we brought on in really what is a pretty low point in the polypropylene market to make earnings, positive earnings on a brand-new piece of kit that starts up in the lowest of the cycle is, I think, a testament to the strength of the projects that we are investing in and bringing online.\nRyan Todd: Thanks Darren and Kathy.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nKathy Mikells: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.\nAlastair Syme: Hello. Darren and Kathy, thanks very much. I wonder if I could just ask about unit depreciation trends. There's quite a big change first quarter versus fourth quarter in depreciation. Is that some of the portfolio effect in the year that we should be picking up? How does that rate through the year then?\nKathy Mikells: Sure. I'm happy to answer that. What you tend to see in depreciation is some ebbs and flows associated with our asset management activities. And so when we're selling assets, sometimes we're taking a small impairment that runs through depreciation. And so I'd say you kind of have to take a step back from that noise in depreciation. If I put that to the side, the company has run about, I'll call it, $19 billion, $20 billion annually in depreciation and amortization. So, that's how I think about it.\nAlastair Syme: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on trading because there's been various press reports about Exxon wanting to build up its capabilities in asset optimization and trading. And I was just wondering where you are in that journey. Because, obviously, we've seen some exceptional volatility in 2022 and early this year across oil and gas. And if I look at some of the numbers from some of your peers, it looks like that those businesses, the asset and optimization could add up to 5% on ROCE in exceptional environment. So, you obviously have a big advantage with your refining footprint and your asset base. I'm just wondering how sort of vigorously are you pursuing this opportunity? And how long do you expect it to take to get to where you want to be on the trading front? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Sure. And good morning Biraj, thanks for the question. I think putting aside the press reports of the media, we've talked about this, I think, starting back in 2018. And what triggered our emphasis on China trade and the emphasis that we're putting on trade is the reorganization that we made coming out of the functional organizational construct into value chains. And as you move in the value chains, the opportunity to trade along that value chain and generate insights and advantage along with value chain changes pretty dramatically. And so that move to a value chain construct that we had early on between Refining and Downstream that -- we now have that with our Product Solutions organization. We've now integrated our Upstream into those value chains. And so we've got a really streamlined and good view of the marketplace. And so we can now trade all along the entire length of the value chain, we can trade across those value chains. And then obviously, we can take advantage of the global footprint as you referenced and trade along that global footprint and arbitrage between the markets. And so I think our organizational construct today gives us a much better line of sight and opportunity to optimize in the trading space. So we started growing that in 2018. That has been what I would say is on a continuum of growth. We like what we see there. We like -- we brought talent in there. We've had -- we've traded for a long time. We just gave the trading organizations within the company some different objective statements, and they've done really well responding to that, bringing value to the bottom line. And what we just announced is taking the trading organizations that today are somewhat dispersed through the organization and consolidating those into one centralized trading organization for the whole of the corporation. We think that makes a lot of sense. We did a lot of work over the last couple of years to validate what we thought the opportunity size was there and what would be needed to get after that. And we're now, I'd say, in execution mode with respect to putting the organization together, putting in the support systems, bringing in the talent, developing the talent and growing the talent in that space. And so I would just think of it as a progression, a continuation with what we believe is a huge opportunity. And we're going to do that in a very thoughtful, controlled pace but one that is very focused on significantly growing the value proposition there, really around our footprint. This is not about going out and taking speculative positions. This is about going out and optimizing, given the asset base that we have, the value chains that we're participating in. taking the insights generated from running those businesses and the opportunities that come with those insights and transacting on them. That's what the organization is going to be doing. And like I said, even in the short time, we've seen some really good results. I think we've got a clear line of sight to some additional ones. And that -- the value of that opportunity will manifest itself in our business that the -- this is really around trading on the value created through the transformation of molecules and developing products that people want and then moving those products around the world. And so that platform gives our traders a great base to optimize off of. That's where we'll see the value accrue.\nBiraj Borkhataria: That's very helpful. Just if possible, a quick follow-up. But does that change at all the way you look to manage your cash balances going forward? I'm thinking about relative to prior cycles. If you have a higher kind of exposure to trading, maybe you would like to run with a high cash generally Am I wrong in that, or is there any -- any color would be helpful.\nKathy Mikells: So we obviously take the company's working capital needs into consideration as we think about our balance sheet and our cash balance, all else held equal, a bigger company means a bigger working capital needs. So that's how I would think about it. I'd also say, as it relates to trading generally, I mean, there's some near-term, I would say, working capital that has to be brought in mind in terms of the trading organization. The profits that come through trading are different quarter-to-quarter, but I'd say year-to-year, pretty steady.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Got it. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. Darren, can you give us an\u2026\nDarren Woods: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Can you give us an update where you are on in Mozambique and also in the Papua New Guinea LNG, in terms of the Papua New Guinea expansion talk?\nDarren Woods: Yeah. I think just I'd speak to maybe the LNG portfolio as a whole. We're making good progress there. I'd say specifically -- and working through project concepts and designs and making sure that we're developing projects that are going to be on that left-hand side of cost of supply curve. We're bringing on production is very competitive in the marketplace to make sure that for the long-term, we have a robust supply point there. I think good progress in both PNG and Mozambique with respect to that, we've had good progress with the government in PNG in terms of getting the agreements that we need, signed and helping us move forward. We're working with our partner there, Total. So feel good about the progress that we got there \u2013 we\u2019re making there. And then with Mozambique, obviously, been on whole for a while, given some of the challenges there, and we\u2019ll continue to keep close eye on that, and as the situation improves and we feel comfortable that we can successfully go in there and develop the project, we\u2019ll take steps to go do that, and conjunction with Total and the work that they're doing there.\nPaul Cheng: Darren, can I ask -- in Mozambique, Total seems to be optimistic about the security on the ground there, just working through on the cost structure with the contractor. And do you guys still have concern on security, or that you are going through the similar process to turn on the cost structure side?\nDarren Woods: Yeah. We work very closely with Total, obviously, given the same exposures and the work that we're doing together. So I'd tell you it's kind of a hand-in-hand approach that we're taking there, sharing information. We've had our own security folks out there assessing the situation. I would say our assessment is very consistent with Total's assessment. We don't see a lot of difference between what the conclusions they're coming up with and our conclusion. So we do like the progress that we've seen there. Obviously, we need to be convinced that that will sustain that progress. And today, I feel pretty optimistic about that.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Welcome.\nJennifer Driscoll: Okay. I think that, that completes our Q. So thank you, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our new investor website in a few days. Additionally, we look forward to connecting again on May 31st for our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Have a nice weekend, everyone. And now let me turn it back to the operator to conclude our call.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Following a record year, ExxonMobil delivered the highest first quarter earnings in our history even as energy prices and refining margins moderated from the fourth quarter. This ongoing success reflects the hard work of our people, executing our strategic priorities and fully leveraging our competitive advantages. Through investments in advantaged assets, mix improvements and cost and operating discipline, we are delivering the structural earnings improvements outlined in our corporate plan update last December and expanding the energy supplies needed to meet growing global demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we added about 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to global supply, primarily from a 40% increase in production from Guyana in the Permian Basin, increase more than offset our divestments in the expropriation of Sakhalin-1, which we no longer account for, but which importantly remains part of global supply. In addition, our Beaumont refinery expansion reached nameplate capacity in the quarter. This 250,000 barrel a day expansion is the largest US refinery addition in a decade, helping meet society's ongoing need for transportation fuels. Guyana, we're pleased to announce that we reached final investment decisions for Uaru, fifth offshore project, which will bring on even more production from this low-cost, low-carbon intensity resource. Uaru will provide an additional 250,000 barrels a day of gross capacity with start-up targeted for 2026. Earnings in our Product Solutions business benefited from the team's solid operational execution with top quartile turnaround cost and schedule performance during a particularly heavy planned maintenance period. Low Carbon Solutions, we're building momentum across several fronts. In early April, we announced a long-term agreement with Linde to capture, transport and permanently store up to 2.2 million metric tons CO2 annually. Hydrogen, we announced front-end engineering and design contract for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen facility in Baytown, ahead of agreement with SK Group of Korea for offtake of blue ammonia from that facility. As we said during our Low Carbon Solutions spotlight earlier this month, our low carbon projects must be advantaged and deliver competitive returns. The ability of our low-carbon projects to compete successfully for capital is important if the world is going to meet its emissions aspirations. Incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act are a positive step forward, although permitting and other regulatory improvements are still needed. Europe, by contrast, policy approach remains far more prescriptive and punitive. This is true whether we're talking about the emissions reductions needed to put the world on a path to net-zero or the production needed to provide Europe with affordable and reliable energy. The progress we're making across the company is underpinned by the continuing evolution of our business model. Effective on May 1, two new enterprise-wide organizations will be up and running. Global Business Solutions will centralize the majority of our finance procurement operations, enabling us to deliver simplified corporate-wide processes. ExxonMobil Supply Chain will consolidate supply chain activities globally. The organizations will focus on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies, improve operating and financial results and, importantly, deliver an improved experience for customers, vendors and our people. On June 1, we plan to launch our new enterprise-wide trading organization. Global Trading will bring together expertise from across the company in crude, products, natural gas, power and marine freight trading, plan to build on our record 2022 results, leveraging the unique insights we gain from participating across each of our value chains and all along their entire length, with a global operating footprint larger than any of our competitors. Now, let me cover the quarter's headlines. We're pleased to have delivered $11.4 billion of earnings, a record first quarter following a record year. A significant contributing factor was structural cost savings that now total approximately $7.2 billion, keeps us on track to meet our target of $9 billion by the end of this year. Cash flow from operations totaled $16.3 billion, and our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to 4%, further increasing the strength of our balance sheet, while supporting shareholder distributions of $8.1 billion in the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends. Biodynamic market, our underlying performance remains rock solid and well ahead of our competition, reflecting the many improvements we've made over the last six years and, of course, the hard work of our people. Our diverse portfolio of advantaged businesses, improvements in mix, structural cost savings, excellence in execution are driving industry-leading earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we have the capability to win across a wide variety of market conditions to deliver strong returns, while meeting the evolving needs of society, including the need to reduce emissions. Leveraging the capabilities and advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we're building an advantaged new business, Low Carbon Solutions, which is positioning us as a leader in the energy transition, in our own and other's emissions and establishing long-term value-accretive growth opportunities that will underpin continued growth in shareholder returns. With that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer. Yes. Good morning Neil. A couple of points, I think as we're looking at the refining margin. Obviously, the first I would make is we don't really pride ourselves on being able to forecast margins. So, our caveat, everything I say with the recognition that given the impact that demand has on the margins, given the fairly static supply side of the equation, it's often difficult to know exactly where things are going to go. What I would say is as you look at where we're at today, I mean, this is seasonally a low point as you head into second quarter and third quarter and driving season when you tend to see supply and demand tighten up and margins improve, you typically see early in the year a lot of refining turnarounds, which take a lot of capacity off-line in that lower demand season. And then when those turnarounds are finished and capacity comes back out, you get a surge of supply. And so you generally see refining margins drop off here in kind of this valley between the supply coming back and then demand picking up as you head into early summer and on to the year. So, I think we're in -- that's important context in terms of what we're seeing right now. Gasoline demand looks pretty reasonable, frankly. I think jet demand and transportation looks like it's kind of trending up and certainly from listening to some of our customers in that space, expectations of a fairly healthy air transportation or airline travel miles going forward in the summer. So, I think in my view is we're going to see the typical push up in the summer and see margins rise longer term. So, it comes back to what happens in China. It has been a source of not only demand but also of exports. There, exports have been higher in the first quarter, but it depends to see how those play out going forward. If we see similar levels of exports as we saw last year, my expectation is that will put additional upward pressure on the margin. So, I think that's kind of the things to watch. The last point I'd make on refining margins, which I think is somewhat structural, typically, the marginal barrel in refining comes out of Europe. And so then Europe set -- is the price setter for global markets ex-transportation. We've got high gas prices in Europe with, I think, the potential to go higher. You've got high carbon prices in Europe. And so that marginal tier of production is a lot more expensive than it's been historically. And that's going to keep, I think, pressure on higher prices for the globe and therefore better margins if you're producing outside of Europe. You bet. Hi, Doug. Sure, Doug. Good morning. Well, I think if you look at the plans we set ourselves, I think, back in 2018 where we talked about, particularly in the Upstream, increasing our divestments and taking a very thoughtful approach there, making sure that we were positioning ourselves that when the market was right and we had interest from buyers, that we had assets ready to sell and divest has worked fairly well. We've been, I think, pretty successful at consistently putting assets in the market and realizing the value of those. We should hit the objective that we set back in 2018 probably sometime this year. And then we've got -- as we continue to work on high grading the portfolio, continue to look at assets that we don't see are strategic necessarily or where we see a potential value -- higher value for others, we'll continue to feed that divestment portfolio and market those assets. So my expectation is we've got an inventory of things going forward and would expect to see, in my mind, kind of consistent rate of being out in the market and basically finding -- seeing if we can find buyers who have a higher use for the assets than we do and therefore better value and therefore decent base. I'd just make the final point that as we look at the divestments, it is a value proposition. We are comfortable with everything we've got in the portfolio. It's really a question of how do we optimize and maximize the value and that's been the focus from the very beginning and continue to be one. So we're not -- we don't have to sell anything. It's only if we find a valuable opportunity to do that. Yes. Okay. Doug, I'll give you this one plus one. Look, it amazes me that the amount of questions that come up in this space, I think we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about it. We're always looking for an opportunity for an acquisition and one that grows value. And it's got to be value accretive. It's got to be one where -- what Exxon Mobil brings to the table actually increases what either company would do independent of one another. And so that's kind of, I'd say, the underlying approach. While we're in a depletion business, and we've got to work real hard to continue to bring volume on it, we're not actually in the market to find volume. We're in the market to find value. And we're willing to kind of let volumes do what they will do in the search for making sure that anything that we bring into the portfolio is accretive and is a unique value contribution for the shareholders. And so I mean, we're working really hard on our technology portfolio in the Permian. I've talked about that in the past. My view is success in technology and developing proprietary technology, which improves either resource recovery or the cost of developing that resource, whatever that is, whatever value lever our technology can bring to the table, that obviously opens up deal space. And to the extent that we are very active in the Permian, we've got a really good anchor business there, and we're working real hard on opening up the value proposition of our current acreage with technology, that will open up potentially opportunities for acquisitions. But that's down the road. That's work that we've got to demonstrate to ourselves. There is a unique value proposition there. And then my view would be we'll leverage that to the full extent that we can. But I'd make the same -- that's true for any of the areas of our portfolio where we've got a substantial business today and ongoing technology work to make advances. That's, I think, really what's going to underpin where we focus our attention. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. I would say we haven't changed our year-end targets, and so the guidance that we gave as part of the corporate plan discussion last year continues to hold. I think we've said in the past that as you look at production in the Permian, it's going to be a little bit lumpy. And so I wouldn't take any one data point, any one quarter's numbers and extrapolate from there. I think you're going to see moving that up and down. I would say, generally speaking, we like what we're seeing in terms of productivity in the Permian. You all know we -- several years ago, our strategy on maximizing oil recovery versus initial production rates that led to a very different development approach trying to work across this cube design, work across all the benches simultaneously to maximize ultimate recovery. That, I think we've been developing that approach, fine tuning it, testing it and evolving that concept. We like where we've gotten to with that approach. I think we're seeing the results of that starting to manifest itself. Our expectation is that we'll continue to, I think, differentiate our production and what we're able to do versus many of the others -- many of our other competitors who started off on this best bench, high initial production rates. With time, I expect to see them pivot maybe a similar approach, but I think we've got a real good head start on that. Like what we're doing there. I think we see some encouraging signs on the early stages of that. And we're going to keep pressing on that, maintain rigs and the capital levels that we've been talking about pretty consistently, and then we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. But we're sticking at this point to same year-end guidance that we gave late last year. Welcome. Good morning. Yes. I would say the short answer is, no. Look, we all know these markets are volatile, that they move up and down. We focused, I'll remind you, on the Beaumont expansion. This is something that we began planning and developing many, many years ago. And it was really built on the Permian production and the changes and transportation differentials by bringing crude into the front end of the Beaumont refinery and making the intermediate products to fill our conversion capacity and backing out imports of intermediates and saving the transportation of those intermediates that are typically coming from afar. And so, we justified that project on a transportation differential and felt that, that provided a reasonable return, and with the expectation that on top of that, we would see the value of additional fuels and the higher-value products that we are producing, exactly what we're seeing today. It is very well positioned on the cost of supply curve. And frankly, that's how you need to think about this business. So irrespective of where the margins go, our view is all of our facilities need to be on the far left of the curve, so that we've got a difference between the marginal price setter. And I have every expectation that the capacity that we brought on in Beaumont will -- I know is on the far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so feel pretty good about its competitiveness. You bet. Good morning, Sam. Yes. And I would add, Sam, I think you mentioned history. And in recent history, it's certainly true that we ran fairly lean on cash. But if you go further back to some of the really high cycles, we carried more cash and it reflected the commodity cycle and the nature that typically we're bringing a lot of cash on the top of the commodity cycle. But that's an important asset as you move into the bottom of the cycle, particularly when you're trying to maintain the consistent investment levels and continue to advance the projects in the portfolio. So, I think -- and time from the markets are on the high end of the cycle, I would expect to see cash balances higher so that we're well positioned as we go into the low end of the cycle, which we know will come. Question is obviously when that will come. Thank you. Good morning Roger. And the final point I'd make to build on what Kathy said is we have seen with all these organizational changes, as our people have come together the new organizations and focused on the objectives of those organizations and what the corporation is trying to achieve, we find a lot more opportunities than we could envision even going in to the changes. So my expectation is as these new organizations come together, they'll begin to find things. The organizational changes we've already made are continuing to find things. So our expectation as we head into the future is we'll continue to drive efficiencies and deliver structural cost savings on to the bottom line. Yeah, sure, I'll take that. I think the first comment I would make is over some period of time, and it's typically pretty short, the world balances. And we always use the phrase of the world as round. So it's hard to stay disconnected with -- the margins eventually have to equilibrate on transportation differentials. And so that's the model that I have in my mind. There are always short-term disruptions. You certainly saw that coming out of the pandemic with some of the logistics constraints. So there will obviously be periods of time where things constrain that. But generally speaking, that happens. I think the margins in the US will be a function of what production source is setting the marginal layer of production. As I said earlier, that has historically come out of Europe. And there, cost structures have increased, and so that marginal barrel is now higher, which is underpinning higher Gulf Coast refining. I don't frankly see that changing in the short-term. Obviously, if additional capacity comes on, it's much lower cost. And that supply overwhelms any growth in demand, and we'll see the marginal price that are changed. And then with time, that will get balanced out based on transportation differentials. My sense of things is if you look back to last year and the export levels coming out of China and the balances in Asia that stayed reasonably tight. The question will be, do we see the same thing this year. And I think time will tell. You bet. Yeah, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Kathy to build on, but I would just say, generally, as we think about the dividend, we try to keep the long-term in mind and also be extremely conscious of the commodity cycles and the variability and the volatility that we see in the marketplace and making sure that we establish a level of dividends that are reliable, sustainable, and I'd like to see those grow with time. That's been our history. That's what you've seen us do. And you see us fight certainly during the pandemic year fight really hard to make sure that we sustain that. And that's, I think, a commitment that I feel really strong about. And so it's really about making sure that what we do there is sustainable for the long-term. And then obviously, we can balance disbursement -- shareholder disbursements with buybacks. But I think maintaining a long-term perspective and making sure our shareholders feel rewarded through the dividend policy is an underlying principle. Kathy, do you want to add anything to that? Thank you. Sure. I'll start then and then, Kathy, if you got anything to add to it. I think, these -- like all the businesses that we're in, the underlying drivers of the chemical margins tend to be the commodity chemicals that are driven by supply/demand and the balances or imbalances in supply/demand. The margin, we saw a lot of capacity come on. You remember, as we went through the pandemic, a lot of investments got stalled and pulled back. And then as we came out, those got turned back on again and have come on to the marketplace. We've seen a lot of capacity coming on. I expect we'll still see some of that come on here in the short term. And then in conjunction with that, the COVID impacts took a while for it to unwind through, what I'd say, is the global economy, which impacted chemical demand. As you know, it's very tied to economic activity. So if economic activity is constrained, then chemical demand is constrained. And we certainly saw that with the China lockdowns. Where we're at now is, that capacity is out there and on and it's just a question of where demand goes. And frankly, I think it's early with China. We do see some promising signs, but we'll have to see how that -- China demand and their economic activity picks up. The other point I would make is, feed and feed optimization is a big part of the margin equation as well. We've got some fairly diverse assets with respect to the ability to manage feed and change feedstocks around. As gas prices came off, that gave us a better liquid to gas spread that allowed us to change some of our feed into our crackers and get the advantage of that. So that was a help in the first quarter, some of that feed optimization. And that will play into it as well. And I think that's what you saw in the first quarter. And then the more macro impacts, we'll see how they play out as we go forward. Kathy, anything? Yes. It's a great example of where we're focused on, advantaged projects that bring on advantaged low-cost capacity. So, that polypropylene unit that we brought on in really what is a pretty low point in the polypropylene market to make earnings, positive earnings on a brand-new piece of kit that starts up in the lowest of the cycle is, I think, a testament to the strength of the projects that we are investing in and bringing online. Thank you. Sure. And good morning Biraj, thanks for the question. I think putting aside the press reports of the media, we've talked about this, I think, starting back in 2018. And what triggered our emphasis on China trade and the emphasis that we're putting on trade is the reorganization that we made coming out of the functional organizational construct into value chains. And as you move in the value chains, the opportunity to trade along that value chain and generate insights and advantage along with value chain changes pretty dramatically. And so that move to a value chain construct that we had early on between Refining and Downstream that -- we now have that with our Product Solutions organization. We've now integrated our Upstream into those value chains. And so we've got a really streamlined and good view of the marketplace. And so we can now trade all along the entire length of the value chain, we can trade across those value chains. And then obviously, we can take advantage of the global footprint as you referenced and trade along that global footprint and arbitrage between the markets. And so I think our organizational construct today gives us a much better line of sight and opportunity to optimize in the trading space. So we started growing that in 2018. That has been what I would say is on a continuum of growth. We like what we see there. We like -- we brought talent in there. We've had -- we've traded for a long time. We just gave the trading organizations within the company some different objective statements, and they've done really well responding to that, bringing value to the bottom line. And what we just announced is taking the trading organizations that today are somewhat dispersed through the organization and consolidating those into one centralized trading organization for the whole of the corporation. We think that makes a lot of sense. We did a lot of work over the last couple of years to validate what we thought the opportunity size was there and what would be needed to get after that. And we're now, I'd say, in execution mode with respect to putting the organization together, putting in the support systems, bringing in the talent, developing the talent and growing the talent in that space. And so I would just think of it as a progression, a continuation with what we believe is a huge opportunity. And we're going to do that in a very thoughtful, controlled pace but one that is very focused on significantly growing the value proposition there, really around our footprint. This is not about going out and taking speculative positions. This is about going out and optimizing, given the asset base that we have, the value chains that we're participating in. taking the insights generated from running those businesses and the opportunities that come with those insights and transacting on them. That's what the organization is going to be doing. And like I said, even in the short time, we've seen some really good results. I think we've got a clear line of sight to some additional ones. And that -- the value of that opportunity will manifest itself in our business that the -- this is really around trading on the value created through the transformation of molecules and developing products that people want and then moving those products around the world. And so that platform gives our traders a great base to optimize off of. That's where we'll see the value accrue. Thank you. Good morning, Paul. Yeah. I think just I'd speak to maybe the LNG portfolio as a whole. We're making good progress there. I'd say specifically -- and working through project concepts and designs and making sure that we're developing projects that are going to be on that left-hand side of cost of supply curve. We're bringing on production is very competitive in the marketplace to make sure that for the long-term, we have a robust supply point there. I think good progress in both PNG and Mozambique with respect to that, we've had good progress with the government in PNG in terms of getting the agreements that we need, signed and helping us move forward. We're working with our partner there, Total. So feel good about the progress that we got there \u2013 we're making there. And then with Mozambique, obviously, been on whole for a while, given some of the challenges there, and we'll continue to keep close eye on that, and as the situation improves and we feel comfortable that we can successfully go in there and develop the project, we'll take steps to go do that, and conjunction with Total and the work that they're doing there. Yeah. We work very closely with Total, obviously, given the same exposures and the work that we're doing together. So I'd tell you it's kind of a hand-in-hand approach that we're taking there, sharing information. We've had our own security folks out there assessing the situation. I would say our assessment is very consistent with Total's assessment. We don't see a lot of difference between what the conclusions they're coming up with and our conclusion. So we do like the progress that we've seen there. Obviously, we need to be convinced that that will sustain that progress. And today, I feel pretty optimistic about that. Welcome."

            "name": "Kathy Mikells",
            "content": "Sure. I'll go ahead and take that, Sam. I mean, our capital allocation approach, I think, has been very consistent and very clear. And we had talked about the fact that we would expect our cash balance post the end of the year to kind of ebb and flow depending on how market prices and margins evolve. So I'd say we're very comfortable with where we stand. It's important for us to have a really strong balance sheet in order to ensure that we stick to our capital allocation priorities through the cycle, right? That's investing in the business and competitively advantaged high-return projects. It's maintaining a very strong balance sheet. You know that balance sheet gives us all the firepower and confidence we need to succeed across a very wide variety of market conditions, which is obviously what this industry faces. And then clearly, we're looking to share our success with shareholders, and you see that through a more consistent share repurchase program and a growing dividend. So, we feel pretty good about our cash balance. I would just also mention that we're in a relatively unusual market environment compared to what we've seen in the past. ExxonMobil's average debt rate is about 3%. You can look up what people are earning on short-term cash. I think three-month treasuries are at 5% today. So, right now, we're not incurring a negative cost of carry on that cash balance, and that's certainly one of the things that we look at as well. So, we feel really good about where we're at today in our balance sheet. I'll try and circle around that kind of suite of questions for you, Roger. So, I'd start by saying, overall, we feel really good about the progress that we've made. We're very much on track for the $9 billion at the end of this year relative to 2019. If you look overall at where a number of, I'd say, different programs are driving savings for us, one is just improving the overall productivity across our workforce. If you think about how that's manifested itself in Upstream, it's been a significant reduction in what I would describe as above-field cost that's been a real focus of that organization. We've made a number of different organizational changes over the past couple of years, I would describe those generally as looking to centralize kind of key functions across the company that have been done disparately. Previously, our global projects organization would be a great example of that. Last year, more recently, the combination of our Upstream -- I'm sorry, our Downstream and Chem organization into our Product Solutions business, a lot of simplification coming across that business as a result, combining our engineering and research kind of groups collectively together and then just recently announcing the combination of our supply chain across the organization and setting up a global business services organization and combining our global trading capabilities across the company. And so that's all about improving the experience for our employees, for our vendors, for our customers and continuing to drive efficiencies and importantly, effectiveness across those organizations. We would have seen actually the benefit of some of that in this recent quarter. We talked a little bit in our presentation about the fact that our maintenance activities, we had a pretty heavy turnaround quarter, and those maintenance activities really came in at the first quartile. So much better than what we had planned for, shorter duration. That enabled us obviously to have better throughput than we would have been planning overall for the quarter. And so that's a big area of savings for us. And that's another organization that we have recently centralized in our global operations and sustainability group. So that gives you, I'd say, a little bit of a characterization of where savings are coming from. And certainly, some of the more recent changes that we've made in the organization, we'd expect to drive efficiencies and effectiveness going forward from here. And then just the last comment, like does the program end. So just to be clear, we've talked about a specific time period externally because we thought that would be helpful in transparency. Internally, we don't actually manage this as, hey, there's onetime period that we're focused on as opposed to we are focused on continuing to drive structural cost savings over time. Those are embedded in the plans that we shared with you last December. And obviously, we'll be doing an update when we come to the end of the year. And so we'll talk in more detail about what we see from there on a go-forward basis. And then I'll just circle back. You asked a little bit about inflation. We actually have put an additional disclosure in our press release, so I'd encourage you to look at that. If you look at the quarter, we more than offset inflationary cost pressure with the structural savings that we were able to generate. Overall, I'd say, the organization is doing a good job at looking to offset inflation in what's obviously been a higher inflation environment recently. Welcome. Yeah, I'd say we look to take a very balanced approach as we think about shareholder distributions and getting that balance between a growing competitive dividend, right, as well as the efficiency through share repurchases. And I think we're striking a pretty even balance in that regard. And we definitely think about this over the long term as opposed to the near term, given we're in a business that's highly cyclical. And so, you've seen us in the last two years raise the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year. We're never going to get out in front of the Board of Directors. It's obviously something that we look at regularly, and we know it's important to ensure that dividend competitive and growing. And about 40% of our shareholders are retail shareholders, so more of the moms and pops across the globe that are investors. And so we know it's important. It's something we're really focused on. Yes. The only other thing I'd add is, we obviously brought on our Baton Rouge chemical expansion project late in the fourth quarter. That's spooled up in quarter. That's part of an overall strategy of growing Performance Chemicals along with growing high-value products across our Product Solutions business, be it performance chemicals or full emission fuels, high-value lubes. And so, even though the market has been tough, that project actually had a positive earnings and cash flow contribution for us in the quarter. So that's a big part of our overall strategy and mixing up in both the Chemical business and across our Product Solutions business. And we feel very good about the results that's bringing. And we obviously have a very heavy US Gulf Coast footprint kind of relative to the global footprint, and that helped us in the sequential improvement in margins. Thanks. Sure. I'm happy to answer that. What you tend to see in depreciation is some ebbs and flows associated with our asset management activities. And so when we're selling assets, sometimes we're taking a small impairment that runs through depreciation. And so I'd say you kind of have to take a step back from that noise in depreciation. If I put that to the side, the company has run about, I'll call it, $19 billion, $20 billion annually in depreciation and amortization. So, that's how I think about it. So we obviously take the company's working capital needs into consideration as we think about our balance sheet and our cash balance, all else held equal, a bigger company means a bigger working capital needs. So that's how I would think about it. I'd also say, as it relates to trading generally, I mean, there's some near-term, I would say, working capital that has to be brought in mind in terms of the trading organization. The profits that come through trading are different quarter-to-quarter, but I'd say year-to-year, pretty steady."

        "content": "Jim Chapman: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. We appreciate you joining us today. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This quarter's presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our Web site. They are meant to accompany the third quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussion of our long-term plans and integration efforts, which are still being developed and which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide two. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our Web site. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the Web site. And now, I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks.\nDarren Woods: Good morning and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's announced earnings of $8.6 billion this morning, one of our best third quarters in the past decade. Even more importantly, this quarter's results continue to demonstrate our enterprise-wide transformation is improving the earnings power of the company. Our Energy Products business provides a compelling proof point. In 2024, year-to-date earnings are roughly double what they were in the same period of 2019 on a constant margin basis. For all of our businesses, we've been focused on reduced cost, higher-return investments, and selected divestments to improve profitability, particularly in bottom-of-cycle conditions. This work has fundamentally transformed our refining business. For instance, we've high-graded our portfolio by divesting less advantaged sites. At the time of the Exxon and Mobil merger, we had 45 refineries. In 2017, when I stepped into this job, we had 22. I expect to end this year with 15, bringing us very close to an entire portfolio advantaged by location and configuration. We've also significantly improved our product yield. By investing in assets, such as the Rotterdam Advanced Hydrocracker and the Beaumont expansion, we've increased the yield of higher-value products from lower-value feeds. Finally, we've achieved dramatic structural cost savings. In our overall Product Solutions business, we've reduced cost by $5 billion versus 2019. In Energy Products specifically, to take one example, we completed our first-half 2024 turnarounds for $200 million less than the previous turnarounds on these assets, a 24% reduction. Our results from the quarter also demonstrate the value of diversification by geography, resource, and product mix, providing natural hedges that increase the stability of earnings. In the third quarter, while liquid prices and refining margins were down, gas realizations, chemical margins, and specialty margins were all up. Underpinning our results is a relentless focus on execution excellence. We saw a good example of this in the quarter at our Joliet Refinery, in Illinois. In July, a tornado ripped through the site, cutting power, steam, instrument error and potable water. We've never had a harder shutdown. With extensive damage to the transmission system that provides power to the site, we were cold for almost two weeks. This was an unprecedented event that severely impacted fuel supplies for the entire region. Our community, the City of Chicago, local, state, and federal governments were all counting on a quick recovery. And I'm proud to say that the men and women Joliet, with a lot of support from across the corporation, delivered. Thanks to their remarkable efforts, we beat an aggressive recovery schedule and we're supplying much needed fuel to the market far faster than we thought possible, reducing the time to recover by a third. I want to take this opportunity on behalf of all of their colleagues at Exxon Mobil and the communities that depend on them to thank everyone involved in the recovery for their hard work, commitment, and personal sacrifice. Thank you. You did us proud. As always, our success is our shareholders' success. This morning, we announced a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.99 per share. We've now increased our annual dividend for 42 years in a row, putting us in an elite tier of the companies known as Dividend Aristocrats. Less than 4% of S&P 500 companies have paid higher dividends every year for more than 40 years. We've also sustained our position at top five of all S&P 500 companies with the largest dividends paid. We know how important the dividend is to our investors, particularly our millions of retail shareholders. We remain committed to a sustainable, competitive, and growing dividend, which is a key component of the attractive total shareholder return we are delivering. In the first nine months of 2024, we've generated a TSR of 20%, leading all IOCs, just as we've done over the last three, five, and 10 years. Turning to our Upstream business, the portfolio of advantaged assets we've built is the envy of the industry. In the third quarter, we grew production to 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, a 24% increase versus the prior-year quarter. To driver higher value, we continue to improve the profitability of the barrels we produce. Our progress has been exceptional. On a constant price basis, our 2019 unit earnings were about $5.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. Year-to-date in 2024, excluding Pioneer, we've doubled that to $10.00 per barrel. The third quarter was our first full quarter with Pioneer, which added 770,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of highly advantaged production. As we said when we announced the deal, combining our technology, Pioneer's contiguous acreage, and the capabilities of our two organizations is allowing us to recover more resource more efficiently with a lower environmental footprint. In the third quarter, we drilled the longest ever laterals on Pioneer acreage at 18,250 feet or nearly 3.5 miles. We're scheduled to spud the first ever 20,000-foot laterals on Pioneer's acreage this quarter. The benefits of long laterals are significant; fewer wells, a smaller surface footprint, and greater capital efficiency. In Guyana, we completed tie-ins for the country's Gas-to-Energy project on budget and schedule. And we are back to full production. Once the government completes the associated power plant, the Gas-to-Energy project is expected to provide the people of Guyana with electricity that is significantly cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable. This will further spur the Guyanese economy, which was the fastest growing in the world in the first-half of 2024, with GDP up 50%. Our Payara project, which remained online during the tie-ins, continues to perform above investment basis, as has been the case with all the projects we've brought online in the world's premier deepwater development. We'll have much more to say about the upstream business during our spotlight next month. I promised Neil I wouldn't steal his thunder. So, let me just say on the Pioneer synergies alone, which are considerably higher than expected, we think you'll find the story compelling. As I said many times, we're a technology company, managing and transforming molecules provide products that meet society's greatest needs and deliver attractive returns. In our low carbon solutions business, we continue to lay the groundwork for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen production facility at our integrated site in Baytown. Facility represents a new energy value chain and produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of virtually carbon free hydrogen, with 98% of the CO2 emissions captured and stored. In the third quarter, two new partners joined the project to accelerate market development for this new energy value chain. ADNOC has taken a 35% equity stake in the facility. We're pleased to add their proven experience in global market insights to this world scale project. In addition, Mitsubishi signed an agreement for the potential offtake of low carbon ammonia and equity participation in the project. The ammonia will be used to generate power and heat for industrial applications in Japan, helping to establish a new supply chain for low carbon energy. The agreement with Mitsubishi follows a similar agreement earlier this year with JERA, Japan's largest power generator. While we still have some hurdles to clear, we're encouraged by the growing market recognition of the significant value and advantages of this first in the world low carbon project. Of course, the highest hurdle as we've said is the translation of the IRAs technology agnostic legislation into enabling regulations that maintain focus on the what, carbon intensity and not the how. We are ready to move forward once the Biden administration publishes regulations consistent with the legislative intent. Assuming this happens, we plan to reach FID in 2025 with startup in 2029. We've also made noteworthy progress on the CCS front. In October, we announced an agreement with our first natural gas processing customer to transport and store 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This is our fifth agreement overall and brings our total CO2 contracted for storage to 6.7 million metric tons per year, more than any other company. In addition, we secured the largest offshore CO2 storage site in the United States through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. The 271,000 acre site further solidifies the U.S. Gulf Coast as a leading market for carbon capture, transport and storage. In addition to LCS, we're advancing other technology driven businesses that have huge potential. We've spoken before about our Proxxima thermoset resin, which is a revolutionary new material that is stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than conventional alternatives. We see a total addressable market in the space of 5 million tons per year and $30 billion by 2030. One major application of Proxxima is rebar that is only one-fourth the weight, but twice as strong as steel. In the third quarter, we signed a licensing agreement with Neuvokas Corporation, a North American manufacturer of rebar from Proxxima. That allows rebar to be produced anywhere in the world. Rebar is just one example of Proxxima's value in use. Others include high performance coatings and a range of lightweighting applications for automobiles. In our carbon materials venture, we see a massive opportunity in the market for battery anode materials, which could grow at 25% per year and like Proxxima reach $30 billion by 2030. The primary material in battery anodes is graphite and we've developed proprietary technology that allows us to produce feedstock for next generation graphite at scale. This innovative material has potential to improve EV battery range by 30% and enable faster charging. ExxonMobil's history with transportation dates to the very beginning of the automotive age, when we provided fuel for Henry Ford's first automobiles. Some might find it ironic, but with the work we're doing in lithium for cathodes, graphite for anodes, Proxxima as a lightweight battery case and the plastics, lubricants and cooling fluids we already provide, we may become one of the most important players in a new automotive age of EVs. At our corporate plan update next month, we'll highlight how we're investing in technology-based high-return growth opportunities across all of our businesses, from the Upstream to Product Solutions, to LCS, to new growth areas. What I would leave you with today is this, all our success, our continuously improving profitability, our execution excellence, our technological innovation, and our tremendous portfolio of growth opportunities flows from our strategy and focus on fully leveraging our core capabilities and competitive advantages. The most important being our people. We have the best team in this industry; and in my view, any industry. I look forward to sharing more of their work during the corporate plan update. Thank you.\nJim Chapman: Thank you, Darren. Now, let's move to our Q&A session. And as a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that, operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Darren, you had some helpful prepared remarks on the downstream business. So, I actually wanted to start there. If we look at results in the quarter, they were strong and actually looks like they came in a bit ahead of what was implied by the 8-K earnings considerations, even with that Joliet impact you discussed, and softening crack spreads in the quarter. And it looks like margin capture, volume costs were all factors here. So, I was wondering if you could just talk through some of the latest trends you're seeing across your refining footprint, the drivers of that beat versus the earnings considerations, and then, specifically, how some of the strategic projects are impacting results relative to your expectations?\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure, Devin. I'll start with that, and then see if Kathy wants to add anything. I think you've got to step back to the broader approach that we've established with the downstream business and its integration into the new company of Product Solutions, which is really looking at how you optimize the full value chain. That, I think, is a fundamentally different approach to how we were historically running the refining business, and looking at all the value levers to pull from bringing crude in to the refineries, all the way out to marketing the products. And I think the results that we see in that business are reflective of a collection of those efforts across the whole. In addition to a lot of the cost cutting that we've doing to reduce structural cost, and the effectiveness and improvements that we're seeing by centralizing a lot of activities and bringing the best thinking of the corporation to bear on each part of the business that we're operating. A great example in the refining business has been the centralization of the maintenance approach that we're doing, not just in turnarounds, but in our routine day-to-day maintenance. That has brought a huge amount of value and lower cost to our refineries operating around the globe by taking the best thinking across both our Upstream and downstream and chemical businesses, consolidating that into a single approach, and then effectively executing that at each of the sites is driving huge value. I think two, eliminating what was somewhat of an artificial barrier between our chemical businesses in the facility and our refining business in the facility, and making sure that the organization thinks about the whole and optimizes the whole in the disposition of each stream as it flows through those facilities is having a big impact. So just I would say the optimization of the facility and the molecules that flow through those facilities, irrespective of whether it's a product that goes into the petroleum product space or whether it goes into the chemical product space, I think has been a significant uplift. And then on top of that, I would say the thinking about the channels to market and the value uplift we can get through those channels, and bringing a trading organization along and thinking about them as a value channel to optimize across the value chain that our refineries participate is also bringing additional value in making sure that we're maximizing the value and the placement value of all the barrels that come out of the refinery, and all the products that come out of the refinery. So, there is a collection of things that have been changed over the years that are fundamentally different than how we've historically been running the business. And obviously, some of those and the benefits of those will move with the market environment and the available spreads in the market. But, generally speaking, it's a combination of a lot of things that we've been working on to drive value in that business, along with the others. Kathy, anything to add?\nKathy Mikells: The only that I'd add is we try pretty hard to demonstrate in the materials we provide you earnings the underlying big movers that are improving the earnings power of the company. And so, in this case, I'd say we put forward the year-to-date results more so than just the quarter because that's a bit easier then to see that coming through our results. So, if you look at our Energy Products business on a year-to-date basis, you'll see that we got about $500 million uplift from advantaged project growth, as well as cost savings, right. So, that's coming from both the Beaumont expansion as well as Permian Crude Venture, and all the structural cost savings that we're driving, not just through the Energy Products business, but obviously more broadly for the company. And then early on in the question you referenced we came in a bit better than what the Street was expecting in this area. One of the reasons we came in better was the much faster startup at Joliet. And so, we had given some guidance on what we thought that impact was going to be. And the team just did a wonderful job in restarting that facility safely and more quickly than we had expected. And that also really accrued to our bottom line.\nDevin McDermott: Great, appreciate the detailed response. Thanks.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Devin.\nOperator: The next is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, good morning, Darren, Kathy, and team. I just want to spend some time talking about the startups of the key LNG projects. And maybe you could talk about what we're seeing in terms of de-risking Golden Pass, and bringing that into service? And then we get less visibility on what's happening in Qatar, but it's going to be a big important project, North Field Expansion. So, to the extent you're able to, can you just share your perspective of how that's going on the ground?\nDarren Woods: Yes, good morning, Neil. Thanks for the question. I'll just say, obviously, that the Golden Pass venture is managing the project, and we're contributing as best we can, and obviously worked with the venture in response to the bankruptcy. And that team, I think, is making really good progress at re-optimizing the work and the schedule. We anticipate today that that venture will basically be delayed by about six months. So, we expect to see first LNG out of that train back-end of 2025, to potentially slipping over into the New Year, but it'll be in that timeframe that we see. And then, of course, each train after that, we anticipate about six months' separation between the trains coming on. So, think that venture has done a lot of really good work to overcome what was a pretty challenging set of circumstance. And we feel pretty good about the path that they're on. There's still more work to do, but I think a really good vector. And the fact that the existing contractors that were involved in that venture have stepped in to fill the void and pick up the baton and keep running the race I think is a huge testament to those and their commitment to the success of this project, along with all the folks at the venture who were working this real hard. So, we stay close to it, but the venture organization there really owns that and deserves the credit for the recovery there. I think on Qatar, same thing. We're a participant in there. And QatarEnergy obviously is managing those projects. But a better place for them to give status of where the projects are. We feel pretty good about the collaboration and our ability to work hand in glove with QatarEnergy, and frankly feel really good about the competitiveness of those projects, and so are fairly engaged with those, and feel good about the work that's happening in that space. And the, obviously, we're doing work in Papua, and looking to make sure we can come with an attractive project there, and looking at opportunities to advance the Mozambique project as well. So, we've got a pretty good portfolio of LNG projects that we see going into the future. And the market response that we're seeing on the potential for those projects is very positive. So, we see strong demand signals and, frankly, a lot of customer interest. So, I feel good about the LNG business as a whole. And then I think working really constructively through the projects that are in development or under construction, and then making good progress on the concepts and the engineering for the LNG projects to come.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Darren.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Leggett of Wolfe Research.\nDoug Leggett:\n,:\nDarren Woods: Yes, I think, there's a lot of -- as you know, having spent some time down there, Doug, a lot of variables at play. And oftentimes those investments that we make are coming in -- or coming on stream at the back end of the year. And so, part of the capacity versus production is just the timing of when we bring those projects on. Then, obviously, there's the timing of -- as we know, all these resources over time deplete. And the organization is working really hard at infill drilling and doing the other things they need to keep capacity utilization high. And so, that work and the timing of that, scheduling of that work, features into it. And so, I think a lot of those things go into it. We do our best to give all of you a good view of what we expect to be producing versus the capacity. And obviously, the organization is working really hard to do an even better job. And everyone, I think, that's working that project, and as we've demonstrated over the years, is very focused on continuing to operate those facilities in a very environmentally responsible way. We've been very pleased with the low level of flaring that they've managed to achieve. The ability to bring those facilities on really in an outstanding fashion with very low levels of flaring as they start these things up and then continue to run with no routine flaring. And then, at the same time, really push production to make sure that we're fully utilizing the capital that we put in the ground and doing that very safely. And we continue to surprise ourselves with the ability of those organizations to find ways to fill up that capital. My expectation is they'll continue to do that. Really hard to forecast exactly how successful they are going forward. But we focus on the capacity and then the targets that we're providing you. And we'll give you updates. Obviously, in our best interest, as we sharpen our plans and get a better look at things that we'll bring that forward and share it with the rest of you. And I do think when we get into December with the corporate plan reveal, I know that Neil is anxious to talk about his entire portfolio and the progress that we're making across not only Guyana but the Permian. So, we'll give you some more color commentary then as well.\nDoug Leggett: Great. Thanks so much.\nDarren Woods: You bet. Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: The next question is from John Royall of J.P. Morgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question is on your balance sheet. The 5% net debt to capital is very impressive. And you're continuing to live within your means on the cash flow side, even when the cycle is turning down off of peaks. So, my question is do you consider yourselves under levered at the higher point in the cycle? And expecting to get your leverage back to higher levels as you continue a steady capital return program at the low point in the cycle, or does the fact that you've remained in the 5% or less type of range for almost two years now maybe mean that you could get a little more aggressive on returning capital and go a little higher on the leverage side?\nKathy Mikells: Sure, I'm happy to take that. So, look, what we're doing with our capital structure is pretty purposeful. And I think we've been straightforward about that. We, obviously, operate in an industry that has commodity cycles. And it's really important for us and a clear competitive advantage to have an incredibly strong balance sheet to manage through those cycles and to have flexibility, right? So, you see us continuing to focus on a very strong approach in terms of capital allocation. And first and foremost, when we think about capital allocation, we think about making sure we have the firepower to invest in what are great projects with great returns. Growing things like the Permian and Guyana, investing in strategic projects in our EMPS business like China 1, which will start up next year, as well as continuing to invest in more capacity for things like advanced recycling and building our low-carbon solutions business. We then really want to make sure that we keep that balance sheet strong because we want flexibility when inevitably the market gets softer and then clearly we're looking to reward our shareholders with our success. And you would have seen that this quarter with the $0.4 quarterly dividend raise. And in Darren's comments, he mentioned it's the 42nd year in a row that our annual dividends have increased. That puts us in a quite small group of companies in the S&P 500. Only 4% of companies have that kind of longevity in terms of annual dividend growth on an ongoing basis. So, it's important to us that we're conservative now with that balance sheet to give us all the flexibility that we need through the cycles that we have to manage through.\nDarren Woods: Yes, and I would add to that, John, I think as we've talked about, it feels like every year I've been in the job. For us, the definition of disciplined capital spending is only investing in the things where you have an advantage, where your projects are robust to down cycles and where they deliver highly advantaged returns. And so, that portfolio of investment opportunities, were very keen on prosecuting across the cycles. And I think that's what we're always mindful of is ultimately we know there's going to be business cycles, commodity cycles, price cycles, but ultimately the demand for the products that we're trying to produce and the advantage of the projects that we're investing in to produce those products are going to be needed. And so, having the constancy of purpose there and being able to continue to invest through the down cycles are really, really critical. And so, that's fundamental to how we're thinking about this. We got good projects. We need to execute on those projects, and if we find additional opportunities as we move forward, we need to invest in those as well. That's going to drive kind of the approach that we take to the rest of the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities.\nJohn Royall: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Thank you. The next question is from Betty Jiang of Barclays.\nBetty Jiang: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about the Permian efficiencies and trends in general. I know we will get a lot more in December, but if we could get some early flavor on what you're seeing in the fields, specifically these 3.5 to 4-mile laterals seems really interesting. And is that part of this image that you have identified with Pioneer initially?\nDarren Woods: Sure. I'll start, Betty, and then, I'll let Kathy add some perspective as well. I would say, just at a very high level, we could not be more thrilled by what we're finding with respect to bringing the two organizations together and the opportunity that's in front of us I think we certainly had saw a big opportunity for Exxon Mobil to bring some of its strengths to the Pioneer acreage and the work that they were doing we anticipated the reverse happening where the organization's Pioneer could bring a lot to what Exxon Mobil was doing, but frankly, very hard for us to estimate that prior to closing the acquisition and getting together and working together. I think what we're finding through that process is there's a real big opportunity to bring a lot of what Pioneer is doing into our operations. Here's a couple of examples. They've got a world-class water infrastructure network that we're now leveraging to serve the combined assets at a much lower cost. They've got a remote logistic operations center to help on their supply chain, and we're taking full advantage of that. We just achieved an all-time Pioneer record for drilling performance in terms of lateral feet drilled per day. We're leveraging the cube design that we had and applying it to good effect in the Pioneer acreage. We're harmonizing a lot of the specifications that we have on materials and services to try to take advantage of the scale and to simplify the procurement supply chain and drive cost efficiencies. And I would just say, as everyone talks about, there's a lot of art to this drilling and completions improvements and getting the best thinking of both organizations and actually in combination, developing thoughts and approaches that neither organization came up with independently, I think is all manifesting itself, and additional synergies and we're bringing those synergies to the bottom line faster than we had anticipated and they are larger than we had anticipated. So, it's a really I think good news story and one that we're going to spend quite a bit of time talking to you about on December 11th and I know Neil and his team are real keen to share some more of the specifics to help kind of take what has been some high level indication of value and translate that down into a lot more detail so that all of you can get much more better feel in terms of what's happening there. Anything else to add, Kathy?\nKathy Mikells: No, I mean we initially talked about an average of $2 billion in synergies over the next decade. Obviously that would start smaller and build and we're clearly seeing more synergies than we initially anticipated. And as Darren said, Neil will definitely enjoy the opportunity in December to give an update on that and quantify it more specifically.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I would just say that the focus of that team is NPV and maximizing NVP. I think the drive like we've always said, it's not a volumes game here, it's a value game here and the great news is we're seeing a lot of value.\nOperator: The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. I'd like to talk a little bit about Proxxima rebar and your comments around the addressable market. If I think about steel, steel is almost 2 billion tons a year, half is construction and infrastructure-ish, rebar is $400 or $500 a ton. And so, the rebar market is something like say a $400 ish, $1 billion market. You're talking about $30 billion. How do you think it's almost heartened back to value versus volume? When you think about putting this product, which again as you said is lighter and stronger into the market, do you go for value and pricing or do you go for market share and is the $30 billion reflecting that or is that just a preliminary sort of estimate?\nDarren Woods: Thanks, Bob. Thanks for the question. So, I would say, we're going to have targeted areas of rebar applications that we'll look at for Proxxima. So, it's not, we're not trying to address the entire market for rebar, but for the rebar markets where we think the value and use for what we're doing is strongest and therefore generates the most opportunity for earnings growth. Necessarily, it is a segment of the rebar market that we're starting with recognizing that we're pretty early into. I think what we're finding though through that infrastructure market is, as we said at the beginning, when we're looking for opportunities is they've got to be big markets with big value use in order for it to be a material effort at some point in the future. It's got to be material with respect to ExxonMobil and so they've got to be big markets and so we're focused on that. Rebar actually in the infrastructure market is not the biggest one that where we see an opportunity. There's also a lot of advantages just using this thermoset resin as an epoxy and there are many, many applications into a number of different industrial uses that where there's great huge value in use from the epoxy and good margins and good growth opportunities. Also a lot of applications in the automotive sector, particularly as you think about EVs and light weighting, this is an incredibly strong and incredibly versatile product that lends itself to a lot of applications in the automotive industry and so longer term, we see opportunities there. And so, what we've really been focused on at Proxxima is making sure that we've got a good understanding of the value in use that we're working with customers so that they demonstrate, they can see the demonstrated value in use and make sure that we're testing out the value proposition. We've challenged the organization to put together a very aggressive plan in terms of growing Proxxima and then have established what I would say are milestones in our development of that to continue to assess, are we seeing this potential being realized and therefore earning our way to the continued emphasis on the growth and investment. And in these early days things look really, really positive. But this is a new to the world technology, new to the world processes that we're building into the planned process. And as you can tell from the way we're talking about this, we see huge opportunity here. It's very, very consistent with kind of the history we have in our historical chemical business in terms of taking molecules, developing unique applications with unique performance parameters and then selling those into large market applications and this fits right into our wheelhouse with respect to that. So, it's early days, rebar is one of the first out the gate, but I would say there's a lot more to come in this space and feeling really, really excited about this opportunity.\nBob Brackett: Interesting. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bank of America.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Good morning. With China 1 startup drawing closer, what is your view on the medium term Asia Chemicals market? China 1 does mostly high performance chemicals. Do we need to see a return all the way to mid-cycle CHEM's margins for that project to meet your projections?\nDarren Woods: Yes. I'll start with that and then hand it over to Kathy to comment on it. But I would say when we went into the China 1 project, we recognized, I'd say the macro challenges with the chemical industry, particularly in China. And so, one of the things that underpinned that investment and the thinking behind it was making sure that as you point out that it's going to be high performance, but also low cost and therefore competitive in bottom of cycle conditions and generating returns and making money in tough environments. And so, we went into that with our eyes wide open and actually as we've progressed the project feel really good about where we've ended up with the project. So, my expectation is, it will be a valuable part of the portfolio even as the market remains challenged and that challenge will exist for some time. We continue to see good demand growth, but there's just a lot of supply that the industry has to work through and it will take time for the rationalizations to occur, but we'll be in a good position as we've demonstrated to date that our portfolio is built for these tough conditions and therefore our view is once the market clears we'll see a lot more upside than we've experienced here over the last couple of years. Anything to add, Kathy?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. The only thing I'd add is, for us, China is going to be one of the biggest drivers of chem growth longer term, right, as they continue to have their population kind of moving up to the middle class and longer term chem growth is usually a bit above GDP. And so, the fact that we were able to strategically place this big project in China moves us from what was 100% importation model to now having our own production there on the ground. That's very low cost. So, we would expect even though Asia continues to be in bottom of cycle conditions because of the low cost of this facility, we should get to positive cash results reasonably quickly and it will be a very resilient asset for us long-term.\nJean Ann Salisbury: Great, thank you.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Jean Ann.\nOperator: The next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria of RBC.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, there. It's Biraj from RBC. Just wanted to ask around some recent reports in September that you were withdrawing from a farm down process in Namibia. Is there anything you can say about what you saw there that was lot of interest? Obviously, there seems to be a lot of resources discovered there, varying views on commerciality of the reservoirs. So, any thoughts there would be appreciated as well as how you're thinking more broadly about bringing inorganic opportunities into what already feels like quite a full upstream hopper? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Biraj. I would just say maybe a little more generally than the specific question on what we're seeing. One of the changes that we've made in the organization is through this value chain concept is making sure that as we're evaluating potential resources and discoveries that we are thinking about the whole end-to-end process and making sure there is a commercial and economic opportunity set there that justifies the investment. So, we know it is an integrated approach to make sure that as we are doing the work to understand the resources and what would be required to develop resources that at the same time, we're looking at in the context of the cost of developing those resources and then the economics of that cost and returns that we could generate and how even the quality of the resource to make sure that it would be competitive on the market. So, all that now today is built into the early decision making. And at the same time, the size of the opportunity has to be large enough to give us the scale advantages. So, a big difference to how we think about opportunities today versus maybe 10 years ago is if it doesn't work across that entire value chain, we don't see the full value proposition, then we're not going to be interested in it. So, I would say that's just generally the macro approach without addressing specifically any one particular area, which I'm going to refrain from doing. I think then, to the second part of your question, with respect to inorganic opportunities, I would say, look, we all know this is a depletion business. And so, I don't think we can sit at any point in time and get comfortable that you don't need to be doing anything at some point for the future because of the recognition that every barrel you produce is a barrel that's gone, and you've got to keep thinking and have in your mind that you're on this treadmill and finding new opportunities as you go. And so, I would say the organization is very active across what are the three key levers for making sure that we keep a very full portfolio of production opportunities, which is continuing to focus on technology and making sure for the things that we have today, we're maximizing the recovery of those things. Continuing to look for new resources through the exploration lens and finding opportunities in that space, organic opportunities. And then, the inorganic opportunities, looking for opportunities where we can bring a value proposition to enhance what somebody else is already doing in this space. And I'd come back to the formula that we've always talked about, which is anything that is inorganic that we're going to acquire, we have to bring and we have to see an ability to offer some unique value. So, the one plus one equals three has to be part of the equation. And if we can't convince ourselves that, that proposition is there, it's very difficult to justify making the investments. And so, that's a high hurdle to clear. And so, it's one where we've got to work real hard and continue to look for the opportunities where that opportunity is available. And I would say the emphasis that we're putting on the technology side of the equation helps with that, which is what we saw with the Pioneer acquisition. As we drive the technology to improve what we're getting out of our base business, that lends itself to opening up deal space on acquisition opportunities. That's how we think about it.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler.\nRyan Todd: Hi, thanks. Maybe if I could ask one as we think about, maybe this is front-running, but as we think about CapEx in the 2025, is the post-Pioneer kind of normalized run rate on quarterly or annualized CapEx the right way to think about a starting point for next year or are there any material moving pieces whether it's incremental project timing or maybe even more specifically potential for cost deflation and efficiency gains and a lower part of the upstream that could push CapEx way in one direction or the other.\nDarren Woods: Yes, I'll start and then I'll let Kathy fill in a lot of the details. I would just, I think the one thing which you'll hear on December 11th is what Neil and the team did is this is not a bolt-on where we're kind of adding what the two organizations were doing and then going forward with that. This was kind of going back to the fundamentals, clean sheets of paper and developing up what we view as the optimum development plan across that portfolio. And so, the optimization of our efforts across the broad portfolio means that the plan going forward is different than what the individual plans of both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil were prior to the acquisition. And so, it's a new mix, it's a new development plan that that will share a level of detail on December 11. And again, what I would tell you is it's really looking at what do we see as the capability of the organization, the value opportunity, and our ability to deliver on that that's going to set the CapEx plans. But I'll let Kathy provide some additional comments.\nKathy Mikells: Yes. Otherwise, I would have said, look, starting point was look at Pioneers as far as starting point, they would have been projecting their own CapEx before we put Exxon Mobil and Pioneer together at, I'll call it beginning at $4.5 billion and sort of building to the $5 billion level over time. So, that's a starting point. But we are going to be looking at the Permian holistically and we are going to be putting our collective dollars kind of into an overall production plan and program that we think is going to drive the highest levels of efficiencies and the highest returns, as Darren already mentioned. So, the one other thing I just want to take the opportunity to mention is we have been guiding to CapEx and exploration expense. We had said for this year that's going to be $28 billion. That's what we still think it's going to be. That's $25 billion for Exxon Mobil and about $3 billion for Pioneer. We're going to move to cash CapEx for our guidance going forward, and we'll talk about that more during the corporate plan. That's a metric that is consistent with what other IOCs kind of guide to, and it will make it easier for you to translate that information kind of into the cash flow that we provide when we report our results.\nRyan Todd: Great, thank you.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning.\nDarren Woods: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: Darren, I'm interested -- thank you, I'm interested by your comment about the kinetic graphite. Is this a long term over the next 10 years or that this is like over the next five years become a potentially that a very sizable business for the company? And when I say sizable, I mean, what is your capability to ramp up the production warning within the next five years if the market is there to accept it? I mean, trying to understand that, how big are we talking about this one, and what kind of timeline are we really talking about?\nDarren Woods: So, yes, thanks, Paul. I think, I would talk about Proxxima and our carbon materials venture maybe collectively there, because there are two examples of basically looking at our portfolio today, looking for where we saw some advantaged feedstock, where we've got access to low-cost feedstock, and then looking at our technology and capability to take that feedstock and build a product that meets an existing need out there with additional advantage and value to customers. And that's kind of the approach we've taken across both of those. I think Proxxima, as I said earlier, we challenge the organization for both of those new opportunities to put together an aggressive schedule, what it could look like and how quickly we could ramp it. And those businesses have the potential to get fairly large moving forward in the next, call it, five to 10 years and multiple billions of dollars. That's the potential that we see in terms of our ability to ramp up production and sell into that marketplace, assuming that the technology scales up and commercializes successfully and that we get the kind of customer acceptance that we're looking for. So, that's, I think, aggressively we could make that happen, and we have -- we have set ourselves kind of a plan that allows us to achieve that, but recognizing these are new products, new technologies, just beginning to scale these things. We've got a number of steps as we move towards that broader ambition to demonstrate to ourselves that it will be successful, because we're not going to rush in and spend a lot of money until we convince ourselves that what we're seeing today, at a much smaller scale, we're seeing as we ramp this up and implement these technologies. So, the plan today has investments that grow both of those businesses in the early stage to demonstrate the value proposition that we believe is there. And assuming as we go through the next few years that we see what we expect to see there, then we will ramp up the spending and build those into the plans to build on the early successes that we're seeing. So, you think of it as milestones along what could be a very rapid growth plan, but we're not locking in the rapid growth or locking in the capital investments until we've demonstrated the success that we believe is going to be there.\nKathy Mikells: Yes, the only other thing that I'd add to that and something our EMPS business is really good at we have to qualify all these new products for their in-use in any company, right? And that takes a lot of time and effort on our part. Again, it's something that our EMPS business is quite skilled at doing. We do that today as we bring new products to market. But that also creates as you do that a bit higher kind of barriers to entry, right? And again that's something we bring a lot of skill to. So, while it will take us time to build these different ventures up and the product qualifications for different applications, as we do that, we'll build growth and momentum and it will be hard for others to come in.\nPaul Cheng: Very good. Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Gabelman of Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the advantaged asset earnings in the quarter, which were lower quarter-over-quarter. And I'm just trying to understand the underlying drivers of that decline. If I think about it, Guyana production was down 30,000 barrels a day. Oil production from Pioneer maybe added 100,000 barrels of oil. So, it kind of implies that the Guyana earnings per unit are about 3x what you're getting from the Pioneer assets. And I wonder if that math is reasonable or if there were other factors that were contributing to that Advantage asset volume, earnings impact on the quarter? Thanks.\nKathy Mikells: So, the biggest thing that impacted that, as you already mentioned, was the tie-ins for Liza-1 and 2 to the gas to energy project and that impacted our Guyana overall volumes. And so, that impact was only partially offset by getting the additional month of Pioneer kind of volumes on the other side of that. So, those were the two biggest movers. If you take a step back from that though and look at where we're at on a year-to-date basis, I mean, you really see the power of the Pioneer acquisition and Guyana volumes increasing year-over-year. So, on a year-to-date basis, our advantaged volume growth in upstream gave us almost $3 billion of incremental earnings and that's the engine that we're counting on long-term.\nJason Gabelman: Okay. Was there anything that was unique to Pioneer contribution in the quarter that would have depressed it versus where it was last quarter?\nKathy Mikells: Nothing unique, I mean, Pioneer's overall contribution in the quarter, just in terms of the volumes they produced, were, I would have said, pretty steady, I mean down marginally quarter-over-quarter. But again, we only took two months of the quarter from last quarter relative to three months this quarter. And in any quarter in the Permian, we're seeing growth obviously year-on-year, but on quarter-to-quarter, those results might look a little bit different. But we're really pleased overall with what we're seeing in production. I mean, we had a third quarter production record in the Permian of over 1.4 million oil equivalent barrels. So, both the ExxonMobil operation and the Pioneer operation in the Permian is going really well and obviously Darren talked a lot about the efficiencies that we're seeing as we move to the, I'd say deeper technology that ExxonMobil is bringing in its cube development and getting the best of both, both in terms of drilling and in terms of completion experience from both companies and applying that across all the acreage in the Permian.\nDarren Woods: And just to add on the earnings basis with the step up, you've seen increased depreciation with bringing Pioneer into the portfolio.\nKathy Mikells: Yes. The last thing is I'd say if you looked at Pioneer on a cash flow basis, I mean we're already cash flow accretive, which is what we expected to see and obviously that neutralizes for the incremental depreciation that we took on through the purchase accounting last quarter.\nJason Gabelman: Okay, great. Thanks for the answers.\nDarren Woods: You bet.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. To stay away from the December questions, let me throw one at you here on the overall op cost savings, the $15 billion total by '27, Obviously, about three quarters of that's in. I was just curious, you mentioned earlier, Darren, a technology company. Is any part of that cost savings up to the 15 related to any sort of an AI effort internally, or is it strictly the logistics as you've talked before? And if so, is there something beyond the $15 billion as you think about kind of a technology change over time?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Thanks, Roger. I'll start with the end of your question, which is my expectation is there's more to come in this space and I'll talk to AI more specifically, but I would just context it more broadly in that, if you look at the transformational change that we've been making across the entire enterprise, we're very early into that process. We just this year's the plan that we are developing that we will talk to you about on December 11, the new organizations that we put in place, the GBS, the supply chain, even the trading organization, those are just they were kind of the first had some time to run and develop a full blown plan this year and so with a lot more experience under the belt and we continue to see a lot of opportunity out there that will take us time to capture. And so, I would see that there is going to be a continuum there and continued progress that we are going to make, based on the centralized approach, and the organization getting more and more efficient, but more importantly more effective at executing on the core task of driving value in the company. So, my view is that we're going to deliver on the 15 and then as we look going forward there will be more to come as that organization continues to become more effective and more efficient. The technology side of the equation I think is another area that will take longer to manifest itself, but I have a lot of optimism that the work that they're doing will ultimately drive not only I'd say the revenue side of the equation and basically higher value on that side, but also drive cost down. And so, we'll get kind of that double effect of higher revenues and lower cost to improve profitability. There's a good portfolio of things that that organization is working on and because we've now centralized that and organized ourselves around our own capabilities, we can now take the best capabilities and put them to the hardest problems, the most valuable problems, which I think are going to end up delivering a lot of good value. And AI is part of the equation. So, there is a concerted effort to make sure that we're really working hard to apply that new technology to the opportunity set within the company to drive effectiveness and efficiency. So, that's certainly part of it. Like everything that we're doing, it's a thoughtful approach. It's one where we're going to make sure that we can get the value that we anticipate. We don't like jumping on bandwagons and kind of talking in aspirational terms, but I would tell you we do see a good potential there particularly in a lot of the data rich areas of the business and the team is working on how best to take advantage of AI as a tool to help drive value there.\nKathy Mikells: And I'd certainly say if I take one step up from AI and just talk about technology more broadly and especially information technology, that's a space where we continue to have a lot of opportunity. We grew up with very siloed businesses, which resulted in our processes not being very standardized or conforming across the company. That made it more difficult, I'd say, to apply single type technology applications across the company, but that's something that we're getting at today. And so, we'll be continuing to automate much of what we do today manually and that's going to drive importantly improved effectiveness as well as improved efficiency and a way better experience for our people and our customers and our vendors, because we're not always the easiest company to do business with when it comes to information technology and self-service and those types of things. So, that has a big role to play as we look forward. We have a pretty complicated kind of IT environment as we sit today and we're in the process of simplifying that which is going to drive a much higher degree of automation into the business and give us importantly way better and more timely information that will be used to make faster better business decisions to drive better results kind of in the business more generally.\nDarren Woods: All right. Thanks, Roger. And thanks everybody for joining the call and for the questions. We will as usual, we're going to post the transcript of this call to the Investors section of our website early next week. But before we wrap up, I want to again remind everyone we've mentioned a few times this morning of our corporate plan update and upstream spotlight, which will be held next month, December 11, and we will look forward to connecting with everyone again then. So, with that, have a good weekend. And I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's announced earnings of $8.6 billion this morning, one of our best third quarters in the past decade. Even more importantly, this quarter's results continue to demonstrate our enterprise-wide transformation is improving the earnings power of the company. Our Energy Products business provides a compelling proof point. In 2024, year-to-date earnings are roughly double what they were in the same period of 2019 on a constant margin basis. For all of our businesses, we've been focused on reduced cost, higher-return investments, and selected divestments to improve profitability, particularly in bottom-of-cycle conditions. This work has fundamentally transformed our refining business. For instance, we've high-graded our portfolio by divesting less advantaged sites. At the time of the Exxon and Mobil merger, we had 45 refineries. In 2017, when I stepped into this job, we had 22. I expect to end this year with 15, bringing us very close to an entire portfolio advantaged by location and configuration. We've also significantly improved our product yield. By investing in assets, such as the Rotterdam Advanced Hydrocracker and the Beaumont expansion, we've increased the yield of higher-value products from lower-value feeds. Finally, we've achieved dramatic structural cost savings. In our overall Product Solutions business, we've reduced cost by $5 billion versus 2019. In Energy Products specifically, to take one example, we completed our first-half 2024 turnarounds for $200 million less than the previous turnarounds on these assets, a 24% reduction. Our results from the quarter also demonstrate the value of diversification by geography, resource, and product mix, providing natural hedges that increase the stability of earnings. In the third quarter, while liquid prices and refining margins were down, gas realizations, chemical margins, and specialty margins were all up. Underpinning our results is a relentless focus on execution excellence. We saw a good example of this in the quarter at our Joliet Refinery, in Illinois. In July, a tornado ripped through the site, cutting power, steam, instrument error and potable water. We've never had a harder shutdown. With extensive damage to the transmission system that provides power to the site, we were cold for almost two weeks. This was an unprecedented event that severely impacted fuel supplies for the entire region. Our community, the City of Chicago, local, state, and federal governments were all counting on a quick recovery. And I'm proud to say that the men and women Joliet, with a lot of support from across the corporation, delivered. Thanks to their remarkable efforts, we beat an aggressive recovery schedule and we're supplying much needed fuel to the market far faster than we thought possible, reducing the time to recover by a third. I want to take this opportunity on behalf of all of their colleagues at Exxon Mobil and the communities that depend on them to thank everyone involved in the recovery for their hard work, commitment, and personal sacrifice. Thank you. You did us proud. As always, our success is our shareholders' success. This morning, we announced a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.99 per share. We've now increased our annual dividend for 42 years in a row, putting us in an elite tier of the companies known as Dividend Aristocrats. Less than 4% of S&P 500 companies have paid higher dividends every year for more than 40 years. We've also sustained our position at top five of all S&P 500 companies with the largest dividends paid. We know how important the dividend is to our investors, particularly our millions of retail shareholders. We remain committed to a sustainable, competitive, and growing dividend, which is a key component of the attractive total shareholder return we are delivering. In the first nine months of 2024, we've generated a TSR of 20%, leading all IOCs, just as we've done over the last three, five, and 10 years. Turning to our Upstream business, the portfolio of advantaged assets we've built is the envy of the industry. In the third quarter, we grew production to 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, a 24% increase versus the prior-year quarter. To driver higher value, we continue to improve the profitability of the barrels we produce. Our progress has been exceptional. On a constant price basis, our 2019 unit earnings were about $5.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. Year-to-date in 2024, excluding Pioneer, we've doubled that to $10.00 per barrel. The third quarter was our first full quarter with Pioneer, which added 770,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of highly advantaged production. As we said when we announced the deal, combining our technology, Pioneer's contiguous acreage, and the capabilities of our two organizations is allowing us to recover more resource more efficiently with a lower environmental footprint. In the third quarter, we drilled the longest ever laterals on Pioneer acreage at 18,250 feet or nearly 3.5 miles. We're scheduled to spud the first ever 20,000-foot laterals on Pioneer's acreage this quarter. The benefits of long laterals are significant; fewer wells, a smaller surface footprint, and greater capital efficiency. In Guyana, we completed tie-ins for the country's Gas-to-Energy project on budget and schedule. And we are back to full production. Once the government completes the associated power plant, the Gas-to-Energy project is expected to provide the people of Guyana with electricity that is significantly cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable. This will further spur the Guyanese economy, which was the fastest growing in the world in the first-half of 2024, with GDP up 50%. Our Payara project, which remained online during the tie-ins, continues to perform above investment basis, as has been the case with all the projects we've brought online in the world's premier deepwater development. We'll have much more to say about the upstream business during our spotlight next month. I promised Neil I wouldn't steal his thunder. So, let me just say on the Pioneer synergies alone, which are considerably higher than expected, we think you'll find the story compelling. As I said many times, we're a technology company, managing and transforming molecules provide products that meet society's greatest needs and deliver attractive returns. In our low carbon solutions business, we continue to lay the groundwork for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen production facility at our integrated site in Baytown. Facility represents a new energy value chain and produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of virtually carbon free hydrogen, with 98% of the CO2 emissions captured and stored. In the third quarter, two new partners joined the project to accelerate market development for this new energy value chain. ADNOC has taken a 35% equity stake in the facility. We're pleased to add their proven experience in global market insights to this world scale project. In addition, Mitsubishi signed an agreement for the potential offtake of low carbon ammonia and equity participation in the project. The ammonia will be used to generate power and heat for industrial applications in Japan, helping to establish a new supply chain for low carbon energy. The agreement with Mitsubishi follows a similar agreement earlier this year with JERA, Japan's largest power generator. While we still have some hurdles to clear, we're encouraged by the growing market recognition of the significant value and advantages of this first in the world low carbon project. Of course, the highest hurdle as we've said is the translation of the IRAs technology agnostic legislation into enabling regulations that maintain focus on the what, carbon intensity and not the how. We are ready to move forward once the Biden administration publishes regulations consistent with the legislative intent. Assuming this happens, we plan to reach FID in 2025 with startup in 2029. We've also made noteworthy progress on the CCS front. In October, we announced an agreement with our first natural gas processing customer to transport and store 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This is our fifth agreement overall and brings our total CO2 contracted for storage to 6.7 million metric tons per year, more than any other company. In addition, we secured the largest offshore CO2 storage site in the United States through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. The 271,000 acre site further solidifies the U.S. Gulf Coast as a leading market for carbon capture, transport and storage. In addition to LCS, we're advancing other technology driven businesses that have huge potential. We've spoken before about our Proxxima thermoset resin, which is a revolutionary new material that is stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than conventional alternatives. We see a total addressable market in the space of 5 million tons per year and $30 billion by 2030. One major application of Proxxima is rebar that is only one-fourth the weight, but twice as strong as steel. In the third quarter, we signed a licensing agreement with Neuvokas Corporation, a North American manufacturer of rebar from Proxxima. That allows rebar to be produced anywhere in the world. Rebar is just one example of Proxxima's value in use. Others include high performance coatings and a range of lightweighting applications for automobiles. In our carbon materials venture, we see a massive opportunity in the market for battery anode materials, which could grow at 25% per year and like Proxxima reach $30 billion by 2030. The primary material in battery anodes is graphite and we've developed proprietary technology that allows us to produce feedstock for next generation graphite at scale. This innovative material has potential to improve EV battery range by 30% and enable faster charging. ExxonMobil's history with transportation dates to the very beginning of the automotive age, when we provided fuel for Henry Ford's first automobiles. Some might find it ironic, but with the work we're doing in lithium for cathodes, graphite for anodes, Proxxima as a lightweight battery case and the plastics, lubricants and cooling fluids we already provide, we may become one of the most important players in a new automotive age of EVs. At our corporate plan update next month, we'll highlight how we're investing in technology-based high-return growth opportunities across all of our businesses, from the Upstream to Product Solutions, to LCS, to new growth areas. What I would leave you with today is this, all our success, our continuously improving profitability, our execution excellence, our technological innovation, and our tremendous portfolio of growth opportunities flows from our strategy and focus on fully leveraging our core capabilities and competitive advantages. The most important being our people. We have the best team in this industry; and in my view, any industry. I look forward to sharing more of their work during the corporate plan update. Thank you. Yes, sure, Devin. I'll start with that, and then see if Kathy wants to add anything. I think you've got to step back to the broader approach that we've established with the downstream business and its integration into the new company of Product Solutions, which is really looking at how you optimize the full value chain. That, I think, is a fundamentally different approach to how we were historically running the refining business, and looking at all the value levers to pull from bringing crude in to the refineries, all the way out to marketing the products. And I think the results that we see in that business are reflective of a collection of those efforts across the whole. In addition to a lot of the cost cutting that we've doing to reduce structural cost, and the effectiveness and improvements that we're seeing by centralizing a lot of activities and bringing the best thinking of the corporation to bear on each part of the business that we're operating. A great example in the refining business has been the centralization of the maintenance approach that we're doing, not just in turnarounds, but in our routine day-to-day maintenance. That has brought a huge amount of value and lower cost to our refineries operating around the globe by taking the best thinking across both our Upstream and downstream and chemical businesses, consolidating that into a single approach, and then effectively executing that at each of the sites is driving huge value. I think two, eliminating what was somewhat of an artificial barrier between our chemical businesses in the facility and our refining business in the facility, and making sure that the organization thinks about the whole and optimizes the whole in the disposition of each stream as it flows through those facilities is having a big impact. So just I would say the optimization of the facility and the molecules that flow through those facilities, irrespective of whether it's a product that goes into the petroleum product space or whether it goes into the chemical product space, I think has been a significant uplift. And then on top of that, I would say the thinking about the channels to market and the value uplift we can get through those channels, and bringing a trading organization along and thinking about them as a value channel to optimize across the value chain that our refineries participate is also bringing additional value in making sure that we're maximizing the value and the placement value of all the barrels that come out of the refinery, and all the products that come out of the refinery. So, there is a collection of things that have been changed over the years that are fundamentally different than how we've historically been running the business. And obviously, some of those and the benefits of those will move with the market environment and the available spreads in the market. But, generally speaking, it's a combination of a lot of things that we've been working on to drive value in that business, along with the others. Kathy, anything to add? Thank you, Devin. Yes, good morning, Neil. Thanks for the question. I'll just say, obviously, that the Golden Pass venture is managing the project, and we're contributing as best we can, and obviously worked with the venture in response to the bankruptcy. And that team, I think, is making really good progress at re-optimizing the work and the schedule. We anticipate today that that venture will basically be delayed by about six months. So, we expect to see first LNG out of that train back-end of 2025, to potentially slipping over into the New Year, but it'll be in that timeframe that we see. And then, of course, each train after that, we anticipate about six months' separation between the trains coming on. So, think that venture has done a lot of really good work to overcome what was a pretty challenging set of circumstance. And we feel pretty good about the path that they're on. There's still more work to do, but I think a really good vector. And the fact that the existing contractors that were involved in that venture have stepped in to fill the void and pick up the baton and keep running the race I think is a huge testament to those and their commitment to the success of this project, along with all the folks at the venture who were working this real hard. So, we stay close to it, but the venture organization there really owns that and deserves the credit for the recovery there. I think on Qatar, same thing. We're a participant in there. And QatarEnergy obviously is managing those projects. But a better place for them to give status of where the projects are. We feel pretty good about the collaboration and our ability to work hand in glove with QatarEnergy, and frankly feel really good about the competitiveness of those projects, and so are fairly engaged with those, and feel good about the work that's happening in that space. And the, obviously, we're doing work in Papua, and looking to make sure we can come with an attractive project there, and looking at opportunities to advance the Mozambique project as well. So, we've got a pretty good portfolio of LNG projects that we see going into the future. And the market response that we're seeing on the potential for those projects is very positive. So, we see strong demand signals and, frankly, a lot of customer interest. So, I feel good about the LNG business as a whole. And then I think working really constructively through the projects that are in development or under construction, and then making good progress on the concepts and the engineering for the LNG projects to come. Thank you, Neil. Yes, I think, there's a lot of -- as you know, having spent some time down there, Doug, a lot of variables at play. And oftentimes those investments that we make are coming in -- or coming on stream at the back end of the year. And so, part of the capacity versus production is just the timing of when we bring those projects on. Then, obviously, there's the timing of -- as we know, all these resources over time deplete. And the organization is working really hard at infill drilling and doing the other things they need to keep capacity utilization high. And so, that work and the timing of that, scheduling of that work, features into it. And so, I think a lot of those things go into it. We do our best to give all of you a good view of what we expect to be producing versus the capacity. And obviously, the organization is working really hard to do an even better job. And everyone, I think, that's working that project, and as we've demonstrated over the years, is very focused on continuing to operate those facilities in a very environmentally responsible way. We've been very pleased with the low level of flaring that they've managed to achieve. The ability to bring those facilities on really in an outstanding fashion with very low levels of flaring as they start these things up and then continue to run with no routine flaring. And then, at the same time, really push production to make sure that we're fully utilizing the capital that we put in the ground and doing that very safely. And we continue to surprise ourselves with the ability of those organizations to find ways to fill up that capital. My expectation is they'll continue to do that. Really hard to forecast exactly how successful they are going forward. But we focus on the capacity and then the targets that we're providing you. And we'll give you updates. Obviously, in our best interest, as we sharpen our plans and get a better look at things that we'll bring that forward and share it with the rest of you. And I do think when we get into December with the corporate plan reveal, I know that Neil is anxious to talk about his entire portfolio and the progress that we're making across not only Guyana but the Permian. So, we'll give you some more color commentary then as well. You bet. Thank you, Doug. Yes, and I would add to that, John, I think as we've talked about, it feels like every year I've been in the job. For us, the definition of disciplined capital spending is only investing in the things where you have an advantage, where your projects are robust to down cycles and where they deliver highly advantaged returns. And so, that portfolio of investment opportunities, were very keen on prosecuting across the cycles. And I think that's what we're always mindful of is ultimately we know there's going to be business cycles, commodity cycles, price cycles, but ultimately the demand for the products that we're trying to produce and the advantage of the projects that we're investing in to produce those products are going to be needed. And so, having the constancy of purpose there and being able to continue to invest through the down cycles are really, really critical. And so, that's fundamental to how we're thinking about this. We got good projects. We need to execute on those projects, and if we find additional opportunities as we move forward, we need to invest in those as well. That's going to drive kind of the approach that we take to the rest of the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. Thank you. The next question is from Betty Jiang of Barclays. Sure. I'll start, Betty, and then, I'll let Kathy add some perspective as well. I would say, just at a very high level, we could not be more thrilled by what we're finding with respect to bringing the two organizations together and the opportunity that's in front of us I think we certainly had saw a big opportunity for Exxon Mobil to bring some of its strengths to the Pioneer acreage and the work that they were doing we anticipated the reverse happening where the organization's Pioneer could bring a lot to what Exxon Mobil was doing, but frankly, very hard for us to estimate that prior to closing the acquisition and getting together and working together. I think what we're finding through that process is there's a real big opportunity to bring a lot of what Pioneer is doing into our operations. Here's a couple of examples. They've got a world-class water infrastructure network that we're now leveraging to serve the combined assets at a much lower cost. They've got a remote logistic operations center to help on their supply chain, and we're taking full advantage of that. We just achieved an all-time Pioneer record for drilling performance in terms of lateral feet drilled per day. We're leveraging the cube design that we had and applying it to good effect in the Pioneer acreage. We're harmonizing a lot of the specifications that we have on materials and services to try to take advantage of the scale and to simplify the procurement supply chain and drive cost efficiencies. And I would just say, as everyone talks about, there's a lot of art to this drilling and completions improvements and getting the best thinking of both organizations and actually in combination, developing thoughts and approaches that neither organization came up with independently, I think is all manifesting itself, and additional synergies and we're bringing those synergies to the bottom line faster than we had anticipated and they are larger than we had anticipated. So, it's a really I think good news story and one that we're going to spend quite a bit of time talking to you about on December 11th and I know Neil and his team are real keen to share some more of the specifics to help kind of take what has been some high level indication of value and translate that down into a lot more detail so that all of you can get much more better feel in terms of what's happening there. Anything else to add, Kathy? Yes, I would just say that the focus of that team is NPV and maximizing NVP. I think the drive like we've always said, it's not a volumes game here, it's a value game here and the great news is we're seeing a lot of value. Thanks, Bob. Thanks for the question. So, I would say, we're going to have targeted areas of rebar applications that we'll look at for Proxxima. So, it's not, we're not trying to address the entire market for rebar, but for the rebar markets where we think the value and use for what we're doing is strongest and therefore generates the most opportunity for earnings growth. Necessarily, it is a segment of the rebar market that we're starting with recognizing that we're pretty early into. I think what we're finding though through that infrastructure market is, as we said at the beginning, when we're looking for opportunities is they've got to be big markets with big value use in order for it to be a material effort at some point in the future. It's got to be material with respect to ExxonMobil and so they've got to be big markets and so we're focused on that. Rebar actually in the infrastructure market is not the biggest one that where we see an opportunity. There's also a lot of advantages just using this thermoset resin as an epoxy and there are many, many applications into a number of different industrial uses that where there's great huge value in use from the epoxy and good margins and good growth opportunities. Also a lot of applications in the automotive sector, particularly as you think about EVs and light weighting, this is an incredibly strong and incredibly versatile product that lends itself to a lot of applications in the automotive industry and so longer term, we see opportunities there. And so, what we've really been focused on at Proxxima is making sure that we've got a good understanding of the value in use that we're working with customers so that they demonstrate, they can see the demonstrated value in use and make sure that we're testing out the value proposition. We've challenged the organization to put together a very aggressive plan in terms of growing Proxxima and then have established what I would say are milestones in our development of that to continue to assess, are we seeing this potential being realized and therefore earning our way to the continued emphasis on the growth and investment. And in these early days things look really, really positive. But this is a new to the world technology, new to the world processes that we're building into the planned process. And as you can tell from the way we're talking about this, we see huge opportunity here. It's very, very consistent with kind of the history we have in our historical chemical business in terms of taking molecules, developing unique applications with unique performance parameters and then selling those into large market applications and this fits right into our wheelhouse with respect to that. So, it's early days, rebar is one of the first out the gate, but I would say there's a lot more to come in this space and feeling really, really excited about this opportunity. You bet. Thank you. Yes. I'll start with that and then hand it over to Kathy to comment on it. But I would say when we went into the China 1 project, we recognized, I'd say the macro challenges with the chemical industry, particularly in China. And so, one of the things that underpinned that investment and the thinking behind it was making sure that as you point out that it's going to be high performance, but also low cost and therefore competitive in bottom of cycle conditions and generating returns and making money in tough environments. And so, we went into that with our eyes wide open and actually as we've progressed the project feel really good about where we've ended up with the project. So, my expectation is, it will be a valuable part of the portfolio even as the market remains challenged and that challenge will exist for some time. We continue to see good demand growth, but there's just a lot of supply that the industry has to work through and it will take time for the rationalizations to occur, but we'll be in a good position as we've demonstrated to date that our portfolio is built for these tough conditions and therefore our view is once the market clears we'll see a lot more upside than we've experienced here over the last couple of years. Anything to add, Kathy? Thank you, Jean Ann. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Biraj. I would just say maybe a little more generally than the specific question on what we're seeing. One of the changes that we've made in the organization is through this value chain concept is making sure that as we're evaluating potential resources and discoveries that we are thinking about the whole end-to-end process and making sure there is a commercial and economic opportunity set there that justifies the investment. So, we know it is an integrated approach to make sure that as we are doing the work to understand the resources and what would be required to develop resources that at the same time, we're looking at in the context of the cost of developing those resources and then the economics of that cost and returns that we could generate and how even the quality of the resource to make sure that it would be competitive on the market. So, all that now today is built into the early decision making. And at the same time, the size of the opportunity has to be large enough to give us the scale advantages. So, a big difference to how we think about opportunities today versus maybe 10 years ago is if it doesn't work across that entire value chain, we don't see the full value proposition, then we're not going to be interested in it. So, I would say that's just generally the macro approach without addressing specifically any one particular area, which I'm going to refrain from doing. I think then, to the second part of your question, with respect to inorganic opportunities, I would say, look, we all know this is a depletion business. And so, I don't think we can sit at any point in time and get comfortable that you don't need to be doing anything at some point for the future because of the recognition that every barrel you produce is a barrel that's gone, and you've got to keep thinking and have in your mind that you're on this treadmill and finding new opportunities as you go. And so, I would say the organization is very active across what are the three key levers for making sure that we keep a very full portfolio of production opportunities, which is continuing to focus on technology and making sure for the things that we have today, we're maximizing the recovery of those things. Continuing to look for new resources through the exploration lens and finding opportunities in that space, organic opportunities. And then, the inorganic opportunities, looking for opportunities where we can bring a value proposition to enhance what somebody else is already doing in this space. And I'd come back to the formula that we've always talked about, which is anything that is inorganic that we're going to acquire, we have to bring and we have to see an ability to offer some unique value. So, the one plus one equals three has to be part of the equation. And if we can't convince ourselves that, that proposition is there, it's very difficult to justify making the investments. And so, that's a high hurdle to clear. And so, it's one where we've got to work real hard and continue to look for the opportunities where that opportunity is available. And I would say the emphasis that we're putting on the technology side of the equation helps with that, which is what we saw with the Pioneer acquisition. As we drive the technology to improve what we're getting out of our base business, that lends itself to opening up deal space on acquisition opportunities. That's how we think about it. Yes, I'll start and then I'll let Kathy fill in a lot of the details. I would just, I think the one thing which you'll hear on December 11th is what Neil and the team did is this is not a bolt-on where we're kind of adding what the two organizations were doing and then going forward with that. This was kind of going back to the fundamentals, clean sheets of paper and developing up what we view as the optimum development plan across that portfolio. And so, the optimization of our efforts across the broad portfolio means that the plan going forward is different than what the individual plans of both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil were prior to the acquisition. And so, it's a new mix, it's a new development plan that that will share a level of detail on December 11. And again, what I would tell you is it's really looking at what do we see as the capability of the organization, the value opportunity, and our ability to deliver on that that's going to set the CapEx plans. But I'll let Kathy provide some additional comments. Thank you, Ryan. Good morning. So, yes, thanks, Paul. I think, I would talk about Proxxima and our carbon materials venture maybe collectively there, because there are two examples of basically looking at our portfolio today, looking for where we saw some advantaged feedstock, where we've got access to low-cost feedstock, and then looking at our technology and capability to take that feedstock and build a product that meets an existing need out there with additional advantage and value to customers. And that's kind of the approach we've taken across both of those. I think Proxxima, as I said earlier, we challenge the organization for both of those new opportunities to put together an aggressive schedule, what it could look like and how quickly we could ramp it. And those businesses have the potential to get fairly large moving forward in the next, call it, five to 10 years and multiple billions of dollars. That's the potential that we see in terms of our ability to ramp up production and sell into that marketplace, assuming that the technology scales up and commercializes successfully and that we get the kind of customer acceptance that we're looking for. So, that's, I think, aggressively we could make that happen, and we have -- we have set ourselves kind of a plan that allows us to achieve that, but recognizing these are new products, new technologies, just beginning to scale these things. We've got a number of steps as we move towards that broader ambition to demonstrate to ourselves that it will be successful, because we're not going to rush in and spend a lot of money until we convince ourselves that what we're seeing today, at a much smaller scale, we're seeing as we ramp this up and implement these technologies. So, the plan today has investments that grow both of those businesses in the early stage to demonstrate the value proposition that we believe is there. And assuming as we go through the next few years that we see what we expect to see there, then we will ramp up the spending and build those into the plans to build on the early successes that we're seeing. So, you think of it as milestones along what could be a very rapid growth plan, but we're not locking in the rapid growth or locking in the capital investments until we've demonstrated the success that we believe is going to be there. Thank you, Paul. And just to add on the earnings basis with the step up, you've seen increased depreciation with bringing Pioneer into the portfolio. You bet. Yes. Thanks, Roger. I'll start with the end of your question, which is my expectation is there's more to come in this space and I'll talk to AI more specifically, but I would just context it more broadly in that, if you look at the transformational change that we've been making across the entire enterprise, we're very early into that process. We just this year's the plan that we are developing that we will talk to you about on December 11, the new organizations that we put in place, the GBS, the supply chain, even the trading organization, those are just they were kind of the first had some time to run and develop a full blown plan this year and so with a lot more experience under the belt and we continue to see a lot of opportunity out there that will take us time to capture. And so, I would see that there is going to be a continuum there and continued progress that we are going to make, based on the centralized approach, and the organization getting more and more efficient, but more importantly more effective at executing on the core task of driving value in the company. So, my view is that we're going to deliver on the 15 and then as we look going forward there will be more to come as that organization continues to become more effective and more efficient. The technology side of the equation I think is another area that will take longer to manifest itself, but I have a lot of optimism that the work that they're doing will ultimately drive not only I'd say the revenue side of the equation and basically higher value on that side, but also drive cost down. And so, we'll get kind of that double effect of higher revenues and lower cost to improve profitability. There's a good portfolio of things that that organization is working on and because we've now centralized that and organized ourselves around our own capabilities, we can now take the best capabilities and put them to the hardest problems, the most valuable problems, which I think are going to end up delivering a lot of good value. And AI is part of the equation. So, there is a concerted effort to make sure that we're really working hard to apply that new technology to the opportunity set within the company to drive effectiveness and efficiency. So, that's certainly part of it. Like everything that we're doing, it's a thoughtful approach. It's one where we're going to make sure that we can get the value that we anticipate. We don't like jumping on bandwagons and kind of talking in aspirational terms, but I would tell you we do see a good potential there particularly in a lot of the data rich areas of the business and the team is working on how best to take advantage of AI as a tool to help drive value there. All right. Thanks, Roger. And thanks everybody for joining the call and for the questions. We will as usual, we're going to post the transcript of this call to the Investors section of our website early next week. But before we wrap up, I want to again remind everyone we've mentioned a few times this morning of our corporate plan update and upstream spotlight, which will be held next month, December 11, and we will look forward to connecting with everyone again then. So, with that, have a good weekend. And I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude."

            "name": "Kathy Mikells",
            "content": "The only that I'd add is we try pretty hard to demonstrate in the materials we provide you earnings the underlying big movers that are improving the earnings power of the company. And so, in this case, I'd say we put forward the year-to-date results more so than just the quarter because that's a bit easier then to see that coming through our results. So, if you look at our Energy Products business on a year-to-date basis, you'll see that we got about $500 million uplift from advantaged project growth, as well as cost savings, right. So, that's coming from both the Beaumont expansion as well as Permian Crude Venture, and all the structural cost savings that we're driving, not just through the Energy Products business, but obviously more broadly for the company. And then early on in the question you referenced we came in a bit better than what the Street was expecting in this area. One of the reasons we came in better was the much faster startup at Joliet. And so, we had given some guidance on what we thought that impact was going to be. And the team just did a wonderful job in restarting that facility safely and more quickly than we had expected. And that also really accrued to our bottom line. Sure, I'm happy to take that. So, look, what we're doing with our capital structure is pretty purposeful. And I think we've been straightforward about that. We, obviously, operate in an industry that has commodity cycles. And it's really important for us and a clear competitive advantage to have an incredibly strong balance sheet to manage through those cycles and to have flexibility, right? So, you see us continuing to focus on a very strong approach in terms of capital allocation. And first and foremost, when we think about capital allocation, we think about making sure we have the firepower to invest in what are great projects with great returns. Growing things like the Permian and Guyana, investing in strategic projects in our EMPS business like China 1, which will start up next year, as well as continuing to invest in more capacity for things like advanced recycling and building our low-carbon solutions business. We then really want to make sure that we keep that balance sheet strong because we want flexibility when inevitably the market gets softer and then clearly we're looking to reward our shareholders with our success. And you would have seen that this quarter with the $0.4 quarterly dividend raise. And in Darren's comments, he mentioned it's the 42nd year in a row that our annual dividends have increased. That puts us in a quite small group of companies in the S&P 500. Only 4% of companies have that kind of longevity in terms of annual dividend growth on an ongoing basis. So, it's important to us that we're conservative now with that balance sheet to give us all the flexibility that we need through the cycles that we have to manage through. No, I mean we initially talked about an average of $2 billion in synergies over the next decade. Obviously that would start smaller and build and we're clearly seeing more synergies than we initially anticipated. And as Darren said, Neil will definitely enjoy the opportunity in December to give an update on that and quantify it more specifically. Yes. The only thing I'd add is, for us, China is going to be one of the biggest drivers of chem growth longer term, right, as they continue to have their population kind of moving up to the middle class and longer term chem growth is usually a bit above GDP. And so, the fact that we were able to strategically place this big project in China moves us from what was 100% importation model to now having our own production there on the ground. That's very low cost. So, we would expect even though Asia continues to be in bottom of cycle conditions because of the low cost of this facility, we should get to positive cash results reasonably quickly and it will be a very resilient asset for us long-term. Yes. Otherwise, I would have said, look, starting point was look at Pioneers as far as starting point, they would have been projecting their own CapEx before we put Exxon Mobil and Pioneer together at, I'll call it beginning at $4.5 billion and sort of building to the $5 billion level over time. So, that's a starting point. But we are going to be looking at the Permian holistically and we are going to be putting our collective dollars kind of into an overall production plan and program that we think is going to drive the highest levels of efficiencies and the highest returns, as Darren already mentioned. So, the one other thing I just want to take the opportunity to mention is we have been guiding to CapEx and exploration expense. We had said for this year that's going to be $28 billion. That's what we still think it's going to be. That's $25 billion for Exxon Mobil and about $3 billion for Pioneer. We're going to move to cash CapEx for our guidance going forward, and we'll talk about that more during the corporate plan. That's a metric that is consistent with what other IOCs kind of guide to, and it will make it easier for you to translate that information kind of into the cash flow that we provide when we report our results. Yes, the only other thing that I'd add to that and something our EMPS business is really good at we have to qualify all these new products for their in-use in any company, right? And that takes a lot of time and effort on our part. Again, it's something that our EMPS business is quite skilled at doing. We do that today as we bring new products to market. But that also creates as you do that a bit higher kind of barriers to entry, right? And again that's something we bring a lot of skill to. So, while it will take us time to build these different ventures up and the product qualifications for different applications, as we do that, we'll build growth and momentum and it will be hard for others to come in. So, the biggest thing that impacted that, as you already mentioned, was the tie-ins for Liza-1 and 2 to the gas to energy project and that impacted our Guyana overall volumes. And so, that impact was only partially offset by getting the additional month of Pioneer kind of volumes on the other side of that. So, those were the two biggest movers. If you take a step back from that though and look at where we're at on a year-to-date basis, I mean, you really see the power of the Pioneer acquisition and Guyana volumes increasing year-over-year. So, on a year-to-date basis, our advantaged volume growth in upstream gave us almost $3 billion of incremental earnings and that's the engine that we're counting on long-term. Nothing unique, I mean, Pioneer's overall contribution in the quarter, just in terms of the volumes they produced, were, I would have said, pretty steady, I mean down marginally quarter-over-quarter. But again, we only took two months of the quarter from last quarter relative to three months this quarter. And in any quarter in the Permian, we're seeing growth obviously year-on-year, but on quarter-to-quarter, those results might look a little bit different. But we're really pleased overall with what we're seeing in production. I mean, we had a third quarter production record in the Permian of over 1.4 million oil equivalent barrels. So, both the ExxonMobil operation and the Pioneer operation in the Permian is going really well and obviously Darren talked a lot about the efficiencies that we're seeing as we move to the, I'd say deeper technology that ExxonMobil is bringing in its cube development and getting the best of both, both in terms of drilling and in terms of completion experience from both companies and applying that across all the acreage in the Permian. Yes. The last thing is I'd say if you looked at Pioneer on a cash flow basis, I mean we're already cash flow accretive, which is what we expected to see and obviously that neutralizes for the incremental depreciation that we took on through the purchase accounting last quarter. And I'd certainly say if I take one step up from AI and just talk about technology more broadly and especially information technology, that's a space where we continue to have a lot of opportunity. We grew up with very siloed businesses, which resulted in our processes not being very standardized or conforming across the company. That made it more difficult, I'd say, to apply single type technology applications across the company, but that's something that we're getting at today. And so, we'll be continuing to automate much of what we do today manually and that's going to drive importantly improved effectiveness as well as improved efficiency and a way better experience for our people and our customers and our vendors, because we're not always the easiest company to do business with when it comes to information technology and self-service and those types of things. So, that has a big role to play as we look forward. We have a pretty complicated kind of IT environment as we sit today and we're in the process of simplifying that which is going to drive a much higher degree of automation into the business and give us importantly way better and more timely information that will be used to make faster better business decisions to drive better results kind of in the business more generally."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead ma'am.\nJim Chapman : Good morning everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining us. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investor section of our website. They are meant to accompany the second quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussions of our long-term plans and integration efforts, which are still being developed and which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the website. And now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks.\nDarren Woods : Good morning and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's performance remains strong. In the second quarter we delivered earnings of $9.2 billion, our second best second quarter results in the last 10 years. Just as important, we continue to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company, as Kathy covers in her prepared remarks available on our website. Our overall market conditions were softer in the second quarter. Oil prices remained firm. As a reminder, at Brent between $60 and $80 a barrel real and 10-year average refinery and chemical margins, we expect to generate between $80 billion and $140 billion in cumulative surplus cash from 2024 to 2027. The Pioneer acquisition increases that even further. In the quarter, we once again set production records from our advantage assets in Guyana and the Permian. Including Pioneer, our Permian production surged to 1.2 million barrels per day. In product solutions, our sales of high-return performance products rose 5% sequentially to a new record. Our strong performance in the quarter continues to support our capital allocation priorities, including the distribution of $9.5 billion to shareholders, of which $4.3 billion was in dividends. With the close of the Pioneer transaction, our shareholders now include the former owners of Pioneer stock who have begun to benefit from the strength of our combined companies. We welcome them to ExxonMobil, just as we do the talented people of Pioneer who bring a strong entrepreneurial mindset and deep expertise in unconventional resource development. I also want to recognize the combined transaction team for their excellence in execution. The average time to complete this type of merger over the last several years has been more than 11 months. We closed Pioneer in six months, once again demonstrating the strength of our organization and effectively executing large, complicated projects, including large acquisitions. It is challenging work, requiring deep thinking, a highly structured approach, and disciplined action, areas where we excel. Although, it's still early days, the integration is exceeding our expectations, and I'm confident we'll deliver even more synergies than we've announced. The team looks forward to sharing these details and all the other work we're doing to significantly grow value at our corporate plan update and Upstream spotlight in December. As we look ahead, we see opportunities to grow value not only through our corporate plan period, but long into the future. Later this month, we'll publish our global outlook, which projects global energy demand 15% higher in 2050 than it is today. We see oil demand holding steady at around 100 million barrels per day in 2050, while demand for renewables and natural gas grows considerably. An energy abundant future, driven by economic growth and rising levels of prosperity, creates opportunity for ExxonMobil, no matter the speed or direction of the energy transition. Over time, as it becomes more and more obvious that heavy industry and commercial transportation will not be meaningfully powered by renewables, the world will come to rely more on technologies where we have an advantage, including hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. A serious approach to the transition should focus on moving the world from high carbon to low carbon energy, not simply from oil and gas to wind and solar. The data, science, and economics all support this as fundamentally necessary. Our strategy reflects this reality and since it relies on the same corporate capabilities and advantages under any scenario, it is extremely flexible, delivering strong profitability irrespective of the path society takes. As a technology company that transforms molecules to meet society's needs, we're not defined by our existing product suite. We began as a maker of kerosene for lamps. Today, No one thinks of ExxonMobil as a kerosene company serving the lamp industry. In the future, ExxonMobil will be defined by the technologies and products it is producing to meet the world's future needs. As always, by drawing on our unique combination of competitive advantages. We shared with you a variety of technologies and products we're developing to more effectively meet existing needs, while helping the world achieve a lower carbon future. Two examples where I see significant new market potential are Proxxima and carbon materials. With Proxxima, we transform lower value gasoline molecules into a high performance, high value thermoset resin that can be used in coatings, lightweight construction materials, and advanced composites for cars and trucks, including battery boxes for electric vehicles. Materials made with Proxxima are lighter, stronger, more durable, and produced with significantly fewer GHG emissions than traditional alternatives. In March, we showcased the automotive uses of Proxxima at the world's leading international composites exhibition in Paris. We're progressing projects in Texas with startups planned in 2025 that will significantly expand the production of Proxxima. We see the total addressable market for Proxxima at 5 million tons and $30 billion by 2030, with demand growing faster than GDP and returns above 15%. That's an exciting new business opportunity with significant profit potential, for we have unique and hard to replicate advantages consistent with our strategy and core capabilities. We also see a sizable opportunity in carbon materials, transforming the molecular structure of low-value, carbon-rich feeds from our refining processes into high-value products for a range of applications. We are targeting market segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates outpacing GDP. These include carbon fiber, polymer additives, and battery materials. Our competitive advantages of scale, technology, and integration, combined with our North American manufacturing footprint, provides a foundation for building these compelling new high-margin businesses. I've challenged the product solutions team to lean into those opportunities and develop plans to accelerate the growth of both of these profitable new businesses. I hope we can ramp up investments to make them a meaningful part of our overall portfolio sooner, which will help further diversify earnings and significantly grow shareholder value for decades to come. ExxonMobil has a long history of successfully establishing new high-value and used products for established and growing markets. Consider Vistamaxx, which we launched to enhance the performance of everything from auto parts and construction materials to personal care products and packaging. We've grown our Vistamaxx performance polymer from five grades to 20, and total annual production capacity is 700,000 metric tons per annum, with highly attractive returns and significantly more growth potential. Of course, consistent with the track record we've established over the last seven years, the hurdle for investing will be high. Any investment will have to generate competitive returns, possess clear competitive advantages, and be resilient to the bottom of any commodity cycle. As we've demonstrated, our capital allocation decisions have generated robust earnings, cash flow, and shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities in December. In closing, we have a lot to feel good about. Our performance is strong. Our merger with Pioneer is already creating tremendous value with more to come. And we continue to develop products and build businesses that will enable us to grow properly far into the future across a wide range of scenarios, including a rapid energy transition. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.\nJim Chapman : Thank you, Darren. Now, let's move to our Q&A session. As a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that, operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Darren and team, and thanks for the update. I wanted to build on your comments on Pioneer. Now that it is under your umbrella. Can you build on some of your comments around, one how is the asset performing from a volume and type curve perspective relative to expectations, and two you alluded to synergies tracking ahead of expectations. Can you help delineate what those buckets of out performance are?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, good morning Neil. I'll start with a few comments and then let Kathy kind of add on top of that. I\u2019d say, early days yet two months in, but the work of the team prior to the change in control and then what we've seen since then is extremely encouraging. As we've stated, the Pioneer assets basically delivered a record performance in the second quarter. And if you think about the context of doing that with all the change that was going on with respect to the merger, I think a real testament to the quality of the people there and the work that they've been doing. So I'd say vectors are all pointing up. I think probably better than what we had anticipated, but I would also say it's early in the process. The teams today are working very well together, which has led to frankly, identifying a lot more value opportunities than frankly, I think either of us could see when we were on opposite sides of the fence. And now that we're together working, we see essentially a lot of opportunities to transfer the best practices of ExxonMobil into Pioneer and likewise to transfer a number of best practices from Pioneer into the ExxonMobil Base, which when you think about our size has some tremendous leverage associated with it. So that's all being worked through in detail. As you know, when we commit to some of our objectives, they're based by some very detailed plans that sit behind them. The organization today is working those plans, but we already see significant upside potential, not only in the magnitude, but in the pace at which we'll be able to deliver them. So I think a really positive story there. I'll let Kathy maybe add some additional details. Kathy?\nKathy Mikells: Sure, I think one of the things we've been really pleased by is the number of learnings that we've already had from Pioneer. And so not only will we bring our technology and cube development to them, but they are bringing a bunch of learnings to us. So we're already utilizing their remote logistics operations center in our own drilling and completions operations in order to improve supply chain. They've done some things on the procurement side, I'd say, that we think can help us to kind of leverage up our expertise. They've been really good over the years of locking up their acreage. So we think that's another thing that ultimately we can benefit from. And then as I think everyone knows, they've got a quite large water infrastructure in the Midland Basin. And we'll be looking to also leverage that. So we've been really pleased with what they bring to the table and we're off to a really good start, as we look at building an integration development plan with them that fully utilizes the technology that we bring to the table. And so we're going to have a corporate plan update in December. We are going to do a spotlight on the Upstream, and we'll update where we're at with the synergies and how we are looking forward at that time.\nDarren Woods: Yeah, I guess cap it off, Neil, with we said at the time we announced the acquisition that we were going to produce more barrels at a lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly way. That continues to be the case. That's obviously good for our company, but more importantly, as we said at the time, we continue to emphasize it's good for the US, it is good for the US economy, it's good for the people living in the US, it's good for US businesses and critically it's good for US energy security. So I think this is as I said at the time, going to be a win-win proposition for all.\nNeil Mehta: All right. Thank you, Darren. Thank you, Kathy.\nOperator: The next question is from Betty Jiang with Barclays.\nBetty Jiang: Darren, Kathy, good morning. Since I just talked about Permian, we'll hit on the other region that's also hitting record production, so Guyana volumes continue to exceed expectations and the FPSO just continue to produce while above capacity. We'd love to just get an understanding of, do you think this type of performance is likely to continue and is that translatable for what you would expect for the future projects that's yet to come.\nDarren Woods: Sure, I'll take that Betty. Thank you and good morning. Good to hear from you again. I would say, you know, what you're seeing is the collective effort of our organization focusing on what is a very high value development and making sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities we can find to safely grow production. And as you commented, we are seeing some significant improvements with production rates well above what we had based the investment decision on and that's continuing across all three of them. We try to take that into account as we develop the next and so in theory, you would think we build that into the base and don't continue to see that. But frankly our experience is telling us otherwise, which is this organization, complemented by the work that we're doing with our technology organization, our global operations and sustainability organization, every element of the organization that we have now created and functionalized is very focused on maximizing values. And so, with these new organizations and that focus, they continue to find additional opportunities. So, I would bet that we'll continue to see how performance versus the basis on which we FID, but I would also tell you that every development is unique unto itself and obviously we got to get it up and running and then let the teams get after it and find the opportunities to safely increase its capacity. But I would just tell you, I would bet on our people to find that. We've got a long history of doing it, and it's clearly demonstrating itself with this unique and valuable opportunity here.\nBetty Jiang: Thank you.\nDarren Woods: You bet, thank you Betty.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Leggate: Hey, Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning Darren and Kathy.\nKathy Mikells: Good morning.\nDoug Leggate: I'm still getting used to the new moniker Darren, but thanks for having me on. So I wonder if I could ask a question about portfolio now that you've got Pioneer in the door. You've got a lot of things that are perhaps you could characterize as maybe non-core, a lot of tails in the portfolio. And I'm just curious, we haven't really heard much on the asset disposal front in a while, and I'm curious if now that you've got two very significant concentrated assets to some extent, the Permian and Guyana, what it means for the portfolio in terms of high-grading opportunities going forward?\nDarren Woods: Yeah, I'll start with that, and then I'll let Kathy add anything that she wants to. But I would say, actually, we've been fairly aggressively going after the tail. You remember, I think back in 2019, we had announced that we were going to divest about $15 billion over time. Of course, we got into the pandemic and we said we're not going to, this is not a forced-March. We're going to basically divest when the market conditions ensure that we can realize the value that we think the assets that we are marketing can be realized. And frankly, that's what we've been doing. So as you look at where we're at today, second quarter this year, I think we've basically gotten to the $15 billion in the Upstream. And then if you look at what we've been doing in the downstream, there's another few billion dollars that we've added on top of that. So frankly, from a cleaning up the tail standpoint, we've made significant progress. Obviously, there's a few more things that we're working on and we'll continue to assess every one of the assets in the portfolio, make sure that they are competitively advantaged. And, you know, frankly, as we look at new investments, we force those investments to compete on an industry-wide basis and make sure that they're advantaged versus the industry and therefore can be a supply product at low cost of supply. We also do that with all of our existing assets. And if they are not competitively positioned on an industry supply curve, then the organization has two options. Either we come up with an advantage investment that makes them more competitive and moves them to the left on the cost of supply curve, or we look to divest. And that process has been ongoing across all of our businesses. And then obviously the timing of when we then take action is a function of realizing the value that we think those divestments should bring. And we're patient. We're not going to rush that process. But I would just say staying after it, being very steady, waiting for the market to meet, to be where it needs to be in order for us to [reevaluate] (ph) it has paid off significantly. And basically, we're delivering on what we said we were going to do, and we'll continue to look at it. But I don't see any big step changes here in the medium-term.\nKathy Mikells: And the only other thing I'd note, Neil, is you can see in our cash flow bridges every quarter.\nDoug Leggate: Doug.\nKathy Mikells: Sorry. I'm sorry, Doug. I'm sorry. But you can see in our cash flow bridges, we're pretty consistently every quarter bringing in more proceeds from the divestments that are occurring. You know, in the first half of the year that was $1.6 billion. And then I would just note we had a lot of activity in Upstream. And so that generated some positive earnings for us in the quarter. And so if you look at my prepared remarks, you know, that we published earlier this morning, I talk about sort of $380 million in the Upstream being kind of these other one-off items. And that was a lot of earnings coming in from divestments only partially offset by the one-off cost associated with Pioneer.\nDoug Leggate: Terrific, it would have been worse if you'd called me Jennifer Kathy, but thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nKathy Mikells: Yeah, good appreciate that. Sorry about that Doug.\nJim Chapman: Doug, congratulations on the new shop, the new platform.\nDoug Leggate: And to you, Jim. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\nDevin McDermott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Darren, you had a lot of good updates in your prepared remarks on some of the low carbon initiatives. There's been a lot of progress there, it seems over the past few months and quarters, which is great to see. And I think back to the corporate plan you laid out late last year, this is a growing wedge of your overall capital spending in each of the next few years. So I was wondering for some of these investment opportunities, and more about what miles you're focused on to actually start allocate more capital to these areas. So what's needed to make final investment decision on [ExxonMobil] (ph) [indiscernible] or move forward with carbon materials or build the scale you talked about in lithium production. Is it more commercialization in offtake, technology development, regulatory clarity, something else?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Yes. You broke up just a little bit on that, Devin, but I think I got to gist of your question. If I don't hit the mark then please steer me in a slightly different direction. I think your question around what's required to kind of continue to move along in our investments in the low carbon solution across the portfolio of products that we've been talking about. I would just say, fundamentally we expect in the low carbon businesses -- and in fact, some of these new products that while they contribute to a lower carbon future, they also bring significant value in use in today's application, they have to compete in the portfolio, they have to be advantaged versus what's out there today and they have to basically generate good returns across the commodity cycles. And so the fundamental philosophy that we've been applying in the base business also is required in these -- the new businesses that we are trying to generate. So that's foundational what each of -- and Dan Ammann, in particular but then the stuff that's coming out of the Product Solutions organization, has also got to meet that initial hurdle. And then as you look across each of them, the hurdles to clear to deliver on that expectation vary little bit. I would say in Dan's business with the carbon capture and storage, he and his team are building a brand-new business. And so there are very few, I think examples of where the company is not only developing the technology and the infrastructure and logistics system, but also developing the capacity to supply, while developing the demand and developing the market in general, and advocating on, what I\u2019d say, are the initial policies needed to get things kick started. So there are a lot of moving parts. I would say the broader industry and business community, frankly haven't gotten far enough along this to truly appreciate just how complicated it is. But I\u2019d say leveraging the capacity and capability that we've built over the decades doing this in other parts of our company, particularly in the Upstream, that we are leveraging those capabilities and making really good progress there. On the blue hydrogen project, as we've worked through the engineering -- and we've got a really good line of sight to what that project can deliver. Obviously, a critical element of that is getting the IRA legislation translated into final regulations, and that's a process that's been ongoing. We are optimistic that the regulations will reflect the intent of the legislation. And if it does, I think we'll have a very attractive project that we can then FID here once those regulations are finalized. So I am optimistic in that space. And as you may have seen, we've just added another 500,000 tons of carbon capture and storage into Dan's portfolio. And there is a pipeline that the team continues to work. So we see continued opportunity and growth with good returns in the carbon capture side of the equation. On the lithium same thing -- while lithium is an established market, it's fairly small with respect to what its ultimate potential is. And of course, we are bringing on a new production method with some new technology. And so again, doing the work to understand what the investments required there are and to establish and ensure that we've got a real advantage versus what else is out there and what else needs to come on to meet the growing demand in lithium. But again, I feel good about that. We've told the team, don't -- we're not looking to rush this through and get something, get money spent. We are looking to make sure that we build a very strong long-term foundation. So none of the work that we are doing in these new businesses is schedule-driven. It is all about establishing successful long-term foundations. And then maybe just briefly touch on Proxxima and the Carbon Ventures, which that's a broader effort that we've been on for quite some time, which is to say, leverage our technical capabilities to transform molecules and apply that to markets that exist with unmet needs. And I think we are making really good progress with Proxxima. We've got some, I think very high barriers to entry and competitive advantages there. And so I'm anxious to kind of prosecute that business and establish it as quickly as we can because we see real potential there. And same with Carbon Ventures, again leveraging our ability to transform the molecule, shape the molecules and get some structures that improve performance. I think there is a big opportunity there. So but that's \u2013 I\u2019d say Carbon Ventures is still early in the technology cycle, but I think we've gone far enough along to see some real opportunity there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the challenge I've given the Product Solutions organization is what's a realistic but aggressive business plan look like and what would be the investment required to establish that. And that's good because it grows value today, but it also positions us well. As those molecules become less demanded in their traditional applications, it becomes a much lower feedstock to these new applications. And so there is a lot of opportunity to diversify the [slate] (ph) and protect the business or diversify the business, as we move through the transition. So long answer, but a lot of variables at play here, but frankly, all variables that we feel very comfortable managing. And I think the progress we're making there demonstrates our capability to manage those things.\nDevin McDermott: All right. Thanks Darren. I appreciate all the detail.\nDarren Woods: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from John Royall with JPMorgan.\nJohn Royall: Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. So my question is on the CapEx guidance update. We see that you moved to the legacy CapEx up to the top end of the prior range. And then obviously, you layered in Pioneer as well. But can you talk about the drivers of the legacy CapEx bumping up to $25 billion for the year?\nDarren Woods: Yes. Good morning John. I'll start with that and then let Kathy finish up. But -- so the way -- the reason we put a range out on the CapEx, as we build these plans in the previous year, starting around this time in the summertime and then kind of lock and load them in October. And obviously, there is a lot of things that develop and evolve from the middle of the previous year to -- as go into this year. That range is not meant to have you guys slice it down the middle and fix on a number. The range is to say, we've got optionality here. And as things evolve, we may reduce some of the spending. Or if we find that the opportunities are panning out the way we expect, we may be on the other end. So that range is truly where we expect to be somewhere in -- and how things evolve and what the opportunity set looks like. I mean the key focus here is to make sure that we are investing in highly advantaged, highly profitable projects. And basically, as we worked our way from October of last year into this year, we see a lot of attractive opportunities that we continue to invest in which puts us at the top end of that, consistent with what we understood the opportunity set could look like, as we went into the plan process last year. That's why we are coming in at [2025] (ph). And then of course, we're using the Pioneer number to add on top of that. But Kathy, anything to add to that?\nKathy Mikells: No, I would just say, obviously we have a lot of projects coming online in 2025 and the exact pace of all of those. And therefore, making sure that we provided sort of enough room, I would say, in the initial guidance supporting of all of those projects that are coming online in 2025. We can't pinpoint, predict all of that as we put our plans together for the year. And so just as an example, China 1 is a huge project. It is going to be coming online early next year as an example. So there is always a little bit of give and take, which is why we give the range to start with.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\nJason Gabelman: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually wanted to follow up on the 2025 project startups that you just mentioned, and thanks for a little bit more detail on the China chemicals complex. But as I look to the other projects coming online, I think the largest earnings contributors, include the Permian crude pipeline and then in the Upstream, Golden Pass and then the next [Guyana boat] (ph). So I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those projects in terms of how they're progressing and kind of phasing through the year? Thanks.\nDarren Woods: So I would say consistent with the plans that we put out, the projects are all with obviously the exception of Golden Pass, moving consistent with the planned development and the announced dates that we talked about. All of them, I think we feel really good about in terms of the work that we're doing. And the case for the contributions, the returns the earnings that we expect to get out of those projects, I think we continue to feel good about. Underpinning all the projects is we'd never try to take a position on where we're going to be in the market cycle, but instead make sure that these projects, when they come on, can compete in any of the areas of the cycle. And we've actually found that, if you look at the investments we've made since 2018 brought online, if you look at the aggregate return of that portfolio, it is exceeding the basis in which we FID-ed those projects. Even as we have been, say in the Chemical business at bottom-of-cycle conditions. So I think we continue to demonstrate to ourselves the time we spend to make sure these projects are advantaged in the best case is paying off. And then, of course our global project organization is really continuing to drive very effective execution of the portfolio with -- keeping our cost well within the FID basis and generally delivering it faster and therefore, bringing more value sooner. Kathy?\nKathy Mikells: Yes. And I would just note and especially a big year for our [E&PS] (ph) business. So I already noted China 1. You noted a couple of projects. I mean, the Singapore resid upgrade project is a pretty big project. We have an upgrade project at Fawley in order to bring on ultra-low sulfur diesel. We've got the Strathcona project for renewable diesel coming online in 2025. So a really big year for the E&PS business in terms of the number of projects we have coming online. And then we're going to continue to expand our advanced recycling. So we'll be adding more capacity as well next year. So we noted, again if you look at our IR slides, we talk about projects being a big driver of underlying earnings growth in the E&PS business, and you see that supported by everything coming on in 2025.\nJason Gabelman :\nOperator: The next question is from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Jason's question, and more specifically on Golden Pass. So I guess, at this point, are you able to confirm, update the scheduled guidance for the start-up? And then the second question is just going to some of your prepared remarks. If I think about your Upstream portfolio, a lot of your growth is liquids or liquid prices linked to LNG. I think you say 80% of your Upstream is now linked to liquid business. So I was thinking, as you're building out your LNG portfolio and your trading function, is there any desire to diversify that sales mix a bit more? Or is this intentional on where you want to be? Thank you.\nDarren Woods: Yes. Sure. I'll start with the last part of the question, which is it is a conscious decision to get weighted on liquid prices. And frankly, if you look at the LNG market. And when you're building large LNG projects, you tend to sell those out and sign contracts in advance of the investments, which the market today is linked to oil. And so we continue to have a desire to lock in a significant portion of those developments, so we've got surety on the sales side of the equation as we bring those projects up. So my expectation is we'll continue to be weighted on that, and we're very comfortable with that. In fact, there is been a huge drive since I've been in this job and brought Neil into the Upstream to basically shift the portfolio and get a little heavier weighting in the oil side. And as I mentioned, this morning on CNBC, if you look at the oil that we're producing today, we are producing more oil than at any time since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. So that strategy is beginning to manifest itself. On your Golden Pass project, so we've just gotten through -- the venture just reached a settlement with Zachry. And so that venture is in the process of kind of restaffing and getting started back up again. Obviously, we are in the very early days of that. So there is still more work to be done. And of course, the teams are very focused on getting back to work, effectively executing and bringing that project in as quickly as they can and as close to the original schedule as they can. Right now, our estimate is we are going to see about a six month slippage. So we had anticipated kind of first LNG in the middle of next year. We now are looking at probably the back end of 2025 for first LNG. And that is kind of where the current schedule is. But I would just condition that with the teams are just getting back up and running, and they have a clear mandate to try to bring that in as effectively as they can. And my -- again, my expectation is it will do better than we currently think, but we've got work to do.\nBiraj Borkhataria: Yeah, understood. Thank you very much.\nDarren Woods: Thank you Biraj.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore.\nStephen Richardson: Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could circle back. I appreciate all the conversations about the projects and projects execution and how you've got a number of really important and interesting projects coming on in the Downstream in short order. Just wondering, you've added seemingly quite a bit of length to your Upstream portfolio over the last number of years. And as you think out beyond '26, '27, Darren are the teams continuing to bring you new and interesting projects in E&PS? And do you think continuing that kind of pace of integration out in the plan horizon is still interesting. Maybe you could just talk about that in terms of the investment mix and the opportunities and maybe address E&PS and chemicals as well.\nDarren Woods: Sure. No, I appreciate the question, Steve, because I think you touched on a really important point. I think one of the advantages of the restructuring that we've done is we no longer identify our business with the products that we are making. So if you go back in time, the functional organizations that we established, every refining organization that was producing refining products, and we had a fuels marketing organization that we marketing fuels, and we had a chemical company that's marketing chemicals. We've now combined all that into a Product Solutions organization, which is supported by a technology organization, which, again is not organized around any of our heritage businesses or heritage products, but instead is organized around core capabilities, core technical capabilities to deliver value to the businesses that they support. So while it may not be intuitively obvious, that change in structure and the way we think about and talk about the business has also opened up a lot of white space in terms of the challenge here is how do we take our core advantages, core capabilities. Some of it includes our existing footprint, but a lot of it includes our ability to upsell and to identify value and use applications, and combine that with a technology organization that's very focused on applying core technology capabilities to business challenges and business opportunities which is starting to unlock applications that frankly, in the past wouldn't have been identified because they didn't fit in the context of the organizations that we had in place. But today the aperture is much broader and the playing field is much bigger. And so we see that with Proxxima and Carbon Ventures. My expectation is as we go forward, we'll continue to talk about those markets, and we'll talk about the applications that we are developing. And the technology organization is continuing to look at how else can we use our capabilities and manipulating the molecules and particularly hydrogen and carbon molecules, to make products that society needs and at the same time reduce emissions. So I think that organization has been given a license, a hunting license go out and find how we can lean into and create more value out there and grow our earnings. So my expectation is as we go forward well beyond the 2027 time frame, we are going to continue to bring in opportunity sets as we unlock them through the work of both our Product Solutions organization but also our technology organization. And then of course, we can take advantage of our Product Solutions organization and then go off and build these things at scale and do it at a lower cost than anybody else. So I think there's a really powerful combination there. And our horizon extends well beyond the 2027 in terms of thinking through the pipeline and making sure that we're positioned to be successful well into the future. And I would just quickly add then -- and that's true for Product Solutions which has got the chemical portfolio, our specialty portfolio. And then what I would say are the energy portfolio, but more specifically the molecules that go into energy, that we expect to become feedstocks of the future like they are today for our Carbon Ventures and Proxxima ventures. On the Upstream side, we've got a lot of, obviously growth potential through the back end of this decade. But we -- this is a depletion business, we recognize that. And so that organization continues to look well beyond the 2027, 2030 time horizon, making sure that we have got a good understanding of what it's going to take to keep that pipeline full. So I feel really good about that. I think the way we've organized the businesses and the central organizations that we've put in place to serve those businesses is going to have huge payoffs here in this space.\nOperator: The next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Reed: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Since you all have probably the most geographically diverse set of operations of anyone we cover, I was just curious the most recent news this morning, shows maybe a few cracks in the economy. If you could kind of give us an idea as you look across the products in the chemical side, thinking that's where we really see the demand parts, what you are seeing kind of, let's say, China back around to our side of the globe?\nDarren Woods: Sure. Good morning. Roger, I think the key message I would leave you with across our business is when you look at kind of pricing in margins is there's two pieces, two halves to the equation, there is the demand side and there is the supply side. On the demand side, frankly to start with chemicals, we see the demand basically returning to the kind of growth that we've seen prior to the pandemic. So basically growing at 1% to 2% above GDP. And so that's back on track from a growth standpoint. Certainly, that's what we are seeing in the first half of this year. The challenge in that business with the margins has been frankly, from the supply side of the equation. We've got a lot of capacity coming on and a queue of capacity yet to come on. So that's moral of the story in chemicals, less of a demand and growth story and more of a supply story and a lot of supply coming on in the short-term. And like the past, the challenge in the chemical business, given the large chunks of capacity to come on in discrete times, that you've got to grow your -- got to grow through that capacity to get your margins back up again. One of the reasons why we stay so very focused on low cost of supply, feed advantage and, importantly performance products is to make sure that we've got advantages above and beyond the commodity cycle. And you see that playing out on our chemical business with earnings that frankly are well above what would be expected given the challenging market conditions that we see in the margin environment. China is growing despite maybe some of the \u2013 it is not growing at the rates that we've seen historically the very high rates, but still growing at a healthy clip. And as you come around to the US, we are seeing kind of reasonable economic conditions and growth in the US as well. Europe, I think is probably the most challenged area of the globe. And frankly, with some of the policies we see Europe implementing, my expectation is becoming more challenging, quite frankly and unfortunately -- particularly unfortunate for the folks living in Europe given the -- I think, the drag that the policy they are putting in place is going to put on their economy. So I think China is looking reasonable. India is growing and it looks very, very healthy. The US is looking reasonable with good growth. Demand for -- on the energy side of the equation with petroleum products continues to be very high. Record levels of demand around the world. And again, I think very good supply coming into the equation there, which is keeping -- has brought margins from those very high levels that we've seen in the first quarter and then back into last year. We are now getting back down into more typical ranges. And frankly, all of our plans anticipated that. It is always difficult to call the timing of it, but we certainly knew that the elevated margins that we were seeing in the refining business would ultimately come back into normal ranges. My expectation going forward then is we'll continue to see what I would say is historical volatility levels in that. We'll see times when the margins spike and we'll see times. And the margins are challenging. But again, we've built our refining business to be robust to those. And if you look at the work we've been doing to high-grade that portfolio, we've taken out a lot of the low-margin, less advantaged refineries and are now focused on the integrated refineries that have a mix of high value products that we are producing and are advantaged from a size and scale and cost standpoint. And then on the gas side of the equation -- and the oil side of the equation, oil demand continues to be at record levels. Last year was a record. We anticipate this year will be a record, and then next year will be a record. So demand continues to be fairly healthy from an oil standpoint. It is just a question of working through the supply that is coming on. Most of that led by what's happening in the Americas. And then on gas that's going to continue to grow in demand, and it is another -- again, a function of the capacity is coming on. So I think good news is that we are seeing the industry be very responsive to the demand. And frankly, it is very consistent with the foundation of the strategy that we put together, which is you got to be low cost, you got to be on the left hand side of the cost of supply curve. Thanks Roger.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS.\nJosh Silverstein: Thanks good morning, Darren and Kathy. You continue to make good progress on the cost savings front. It looks like there was an uptick of about $600 million sequentially. It looks like you've called out kind of a $200 million turnaround savings in energy products. Just wanted to see if you can provide some more examples of what's driving the improvement and how you take the current kind of $10.7 billion to the $15 billion over the next few years. Thanks.\nKathy Mikells: Great. Thanks very much for the question. And so, you're right. If we look on an after-tax basis we had about $600 million overall on a pre basis for the year-to-date where our structural cost savings is about $1 billion. So making really good progress. Continuing to optimize maintenance is a big driver of overall savings. We gave a number of $200 million in energy products in terms of my prepared remarks. And that was just noting that, in the half we had a particularly heavy turnaround slate. And if we looked back at that same turnaround slate the last time we did it, we did it much more quickly and we did it at lower cost. Hence the $200 million savings number that you mentioned. We are also obviously driving savings in terms of supply chain and looking to get more efficient there. And all of our centralized organizations which we've kind of stood up over the last couple of years, are really responsible for driving savings into the business. So whether that's global business solutions or whether that's supply chain, or our global operating and sustainability group, who works on our maintenance activities, we are really starting to see the uptick from the benefit that those organizations can bring, by simplifying things and standardizing things, and bringing better data analytics to optimize our overall organization. So that's what you are going to continue to see on a go-forward basis. And then I\u2019d say, longer-term, as those centralized organizations start to standardize processes for the company which are quite disparate, as we sit here today, we'll be able to apply more technology to get, I\u2019d say, even more automated in the things that we do which will drive further efficiencies for us long term. So whether it is getting more efficient on logistics or getting more efficient because we're standardizing now between ourselves and Pioneer, standardizing all the materials and things that we're buying, those are the things that will continue to drive savings. And I think we have both the largest program, by far of anybody in the industry and now a very proven track record that we feel quite good about typically over delivering on the initial plans that we developed. So we are feeling good about the progress we're making, and that overall target to get to $15 billion in savings between 2019 and 2027.\nDarren Woods: Yes. And I would just -- I guess one other way to think about it, Josh is, for the first time in the history of our corporation, we've organized ourselves to take -- to focus on every aspect of delivering the business irrespective of what that business is. Look at where the synergies exist, and are now taking the experience, the collective experience of the corporation and the expertise in each of those areas and focusing it on an opportunity set. So the size of our business, it gives us a huge advantage here. And so a lot of these things you are seeing are accruing by basically taking the best thinking that had occurred in the -- around the organization around the world, and then applying that uniformly everywhere, it is relevant. And that's happening time and time and time again. And so I think a very unique capability and capacity that frankly, others can't match. And the benefits are showing up in these structural cost savings for sure. Also showing up on the revenue side of the equation with respect to better marketing, better ability to sell into value. So there's, I think, a huge benefit to the changes we've been making.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. I'd like to paraphrase a comment Darren made, that lithium complexity is misunderstood by industry. And I'm intrigued, is that a comment around the marketing and the relative use of the Downstream side? Or is it a comment around maybe the Upstream and the complexity of processing?\nDarren Woods: Good morning Bob. Yes, that comment I meant to imply for more broadly, the whole low-carbon solutions business that, where as you look at each of those businesses, they've got their unique set of complexities. For lithium, in particular, you are taking what is essentially a brand-new technology, marrying that with some established technologies for subsurface, some established technologies above-surface, consistent with our processing experiences in refining and chemicals. And so putting those things together in a new business to make a product. I wouldn't say has complexities that people can't comprehend. I would just say they\u2019re new -- and there haven't been very many people who have worked way through that. Where some really unique challenges are is building brand new value chains. And the carbon capture market, as an example where there's just \u2013 there is not an existing market today that pays for carbon removal that's being incentivized with government policy. Government policy is forming, while at the same time, you are trying to build the infrastructure to support that market, the logistics, the supply and then at the same time, develop a customer base. And so the complexity that I see in the low-carbon space, that's a particularly challenging one because of all the moving parts and all the work that has to be done to try to piece those things together to come up with, frankly, a business and business model that, one, is sustainable for the long term. and two, that generates returns that are competitive in the portfolio. But I have to say, we are geared to do that kind of work. Our experience lends itself to that. And frankly, what Dan and the team is accomplishing leaning on a lot of the core capabilities of the organization, and we are tackling those challenges and making really good progress. I think on the hydrogen side of the equation, there is not a real vibrant market or a strongly economic market for low, virtually carbon-free hydrogen. So that's being developed. Obviously, the government incentives are supporting that in the short term. But we've got to work our way to a market-driven forces, so that we are competing in an open market and not relying on government subsidies. So that's, I think, one of the challenges in that space. But I think my comment was more generally that there is a lot of optimism around the low carbon solution \u2013 low carbon businesses in general. But if you think about where progress has been made to-date, most of that's been in the wind and solar and EV areas. And all of those are playing into well-established markets. The power generation market is very well established. The automotive industry is very well established. Now they are bringing in new technologies that have some of their own unique challenges, but they are not building brand-new markets. In our case, and some of the businesses we are building brand-new markets.\nBob Brackett: Thanks very clear. Thanks for that.\nDarren Woods: You bet Bob.\nJim Chapman: Thank you Bob. And thanks, everybody, for joining the call and for your questions. We're going to post the transcript of this call to the Investors section of our website by early next week. But before we wrap, I want to draw your attention to a couple of topics. First, a reminder. Later this month, we will be issuing our Annual Global Outlook, which includes our latest views on energy demand and supply through 2050, and which forms the basis for our business planning. And second please mark your calendars for our Corporate Plan Update and Upstream Spotlight, which is going to be a Wednesday, December 11. And for more information on that, again please see the Investors section of our website. So with that, have a nice weekend, and I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's performance remains strong. In the second quarter we delivered earnings of $9.2 billion, our second best second quarter results in the last 10 years. Just as important, we continue to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company, as Kathy covers in her prepared remarks available on our website. Our overall market conditions were softer in the second quarter. Oil prices remained firm. As a reminder, at Brent between $60 and $80 a barrel real and 10-year average refinery and chemical margins, we expect to generate between $80 billion and $140 billion in cumulative surplus cash from 2024 to 2027. The Pioneer acquisition increases that even further. In the quarter, we once again set production records from our advantage assets in Guyana and the Permian. Including Pioneer, our Permian production surged to 1.2 million barrels per day. In product solutions, our sales of high-return performance products rose 5% sequentially to a new record. Our strong performance in the quarter continues to support our capital allocation priorities, including the distribution of $9.5 billion to shareholders, of which $4.3 billion was in dividends. With the close of the Pioneer transaction, our shareholders now include the former owners of Pioneer stock who have begun to benefit from the strength of our combined companies. We welcome them to ExxonMobil, just as we do the talented people of Pioneer who bring a strong entrepreneurial mindset and deep expertise in unconventional resource development. I also want to recognize the combined transaction team for their excellence in execution. The average time to complete this type of merger over the last several years has been more than 11 months. We closed Pioneer in six months, once again demonstrating the strength of our organization and effectively executing large, complicated projects, including large acquisitions. It is challenging work, requiring deep thinking, a highly structured approach, and disciplined action, areas where we excel. Although, it's still early days, the integration is exceeding our expectations, and I'm confident we'll deliver even more synergies than we've announced. The team looks forward to sharing these details and all the other work we're doing to significantly grow value at our corporate plan update and Upstream spotlight in December. As we look ahead, we see opportunities to grow value not only through our corporate plan period, but long into the future. Later this month, we'll publish our global outlook, which projects global energy demand 15% higher in 2050 than it is today. We see oil demand holding steady at around 100 million barrels per day in 2050, while demand for renewables and natural gas grows considerably. An energy abundant future, driven by economic growth and rising levels of prosperity, creates opportunity for ExxonMobil, no matter the speed or direction of the energy transition. Over time, as it becomes more and more obvious that heavy industry and commercial transportation will not be meaningfully powered by renewables, the world will come to rely more on technologies where we have an advantage, including hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. A serious approach to the transition should focus on moving the world from high carbon to low carbon energy, not simply from oil and gas to wind and solar. The data, science, and economics all support this as fundamentally necessary. Our strategy reflects this reality and since it relies on the same corporate capabilities and advantages under any scenario, it is extremely flexible, delivering strong profitability irrespective of the path society takes. As a technology company that transforms molecules to meet society's needs, we're not defined by our existing product suite. We began as a maker of kerosene for lamps. Today, No one thinks of ExxonMobil as a kerosene company serving the lamp industry. In the future, ExxonMobil will be defined by the technologies and products it is producing to meet the world's future needs. As always, by drawing on our unique combination of competitive advantages. We shared with you a variety of technologies and products we're developing to more effectively meet existing needs, while helping the world achieve a lower carbon future. Two examples where I see significant new market potential are Proxxima and carbon materials. With Proxxima, we transform lower value gasoline molecules into a high performance, high value thermoset resin that can be used in coatings, lightweight construction materials, and advanced composites for cars and trucks, including battery boxes for electric vehicles. Materials made with Proxxima are lighter, stronger, more durable, and produced with significantly fewer GHG emissions than traditional alternatives. In March, we showcased the automotive uses of Proxxima at the world's leading international composites exhibition in Paris. We're progressing projects in Texas with startups planned in 2025 that will significantly expand the production of Proxxima. We see the total addressable market for Proxxima at 5 million tons and $30 billion by 2030, with demand growing faster than GDP and returns above 15%. That's an exciting new business opportunity with significant profit potential, for we have unique and hard to replicate advantages consistent with our strategy and core capabilities. We also see a sizable opportunity in carbon materials, transforming the molecular structure of low-value, carbon-rich feeds from our refining processes into high-value products for a range of applications. We are targeting market segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates outpacing GDP. These include carbon fiber, polymer additives, and battery materials. Our competitive advantages of scale, technology, and integration, combined with our North American manufacturing footprint, provides a foundation for building these compelling new high-margin businesses. I've challenged the product solutions team to lean into those opportunities and develop plans to accelerate the growth of both of these profitable new businesses. I hope we can ramp up investments to make them a meaningful part of our overall portfolio sooner, which will help further diversify earnings and significantly grow shareholder value for decades to come. ExxonMobil has a long history of successfully establishing new high-value and used products for established and growing markets. Consider Vistamaxx, which we launched to enhance the performance of everything from auto parts and construction materials to personal care products and packaging. We've grown our Vistamaxx performance polymer from five grades to 20, and total annual production capacity is 700,000 metric tons per annum, with highly attractive returns and significantly more growth potential. Of course, consistent with the track record we've established over the last seven years, the hurdle for investing will be high. Any investment will have to generate competitive returns, possess clear competitive advantages, and be resilient to the bottom of any commodity cycle. As we've demonstrated, our capital allocation decisions have generated robust earnings, cash flow, and shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities in December. In closing, we have a lot to feel good about. Our performance is strong. Our merger with Pioneer is already creating tremendous value with more to come. And we continue to develop products and build businesses that will enable us to grow properly far into the future across a wide range of scenarios, including a rapid energy transition. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Yeah, good morning Neil. I'll start with a few comments and then let Kathy kind of add on top of that. I'd say, early days yet two months in, but the work of the team prior to the change in control and then what we've seen since then is extremely encouraging. As we've stated, the Pioneer assets basically delivered a record performance in the second quarter. And if you think about the context of doing that with all the change that was going on with respect to the merger, I think a real testament to the quality of the people there and the work that they've been doing. So I'd say vectors are all pointing up. I think probably better than what we had anticipated, but I would also say it's early in the process. The teams today are working very well together, which has led to frankly, identifying a lot more value opportunities than frankly, I think either of us could see when we were on opposite sides of the fence. And now that we're together working, we see essentially a lot of opportunities to transfer the best practices of ExxonMobil into Pioneer and likewise to transfer a number of best practices from Pioneer into the ExxonMobil Base, which when you think about our size has some tremendous leverage associated with it. So that's all being worked through in detail. As you know, when we commit to some of our objectives, they're based by some very detailed plans that sit behind them. The organization today is working those plans, but we already see significant upside potential, not only in the magnitude, but in the pace at which we'll be able to deliver them. So I think a really positive story there. I'll let Kathy maybe add some additional details. Kathy? Yeah, I guess cap it off, Neil, with we said at the time we announced the acquisition that we were going to produce more barrels at a lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly way. That continues to be the case. That's obviously good for our company, but more importantly, as we said at the time, we continue to emphasize it's good for the US, it is good for the US economy, it's good for the people living in the US, it's good for US businesses and critically it's good for US energy security. So I think this is as I said at the time, going to be a win-win proposition for all. Sure, I'll take that Betty. Thank you and good morning. Good to hear from you again. I would say, you know, what you're seeing is the collective effort of our organization focusing on what is a very high value development and making sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities we can find to safely grow production. And as you commented, we are seeing some significant improvements with production rates well above what we had based the investment decision on and that's continuing across all three of them. We try to take that into account as we develop the next and so in theory, you would think we build that into the base and don't continue to see that. But frankly our experience is telling us otherwise, which is this organization, complemented by the work that we're doing with our technology organization, our global operations and sustainability organization, every element of the organization that we have now created and functionalized is very focused on maximizing values. And so, with these new organizations and that focus, they continue to find additional opportunities. So, I would bet that we'll continue to see how performance versus the basis on which we FID, but I would also tell you that every development is unique unto itself and obviously we got to get it up and running and then let the teams get after it and find the opportunities to safely increase its capacity. But I would just tell you, I would bet on our people to find that. We've got a long history of doing it, and it's clearly demonstrating itself with this unique and valuable opportunity here. You bet, thank you Betty. Yeah, I'll start with that, and then I'll let Kathy add anything that she wants to. But I would say, actually, we've been fairly aggressively going after the tail. You remember, I think back in 2019, we had announced that we were going to divest about $15 billion over time. Of course, we got into the pandemic and we said we're not going to, this is not a forced-March. We're going to basically divest when the market conditions ensure that we can realize the value that we think the assets that we are marketing can be realized. And frankly, that's what we've been doing. So as you look at where we're at today, second quarter this year, I think we've basically gotten to the $15 billion in the Upstream. And then if you look at what we've been doing in the downstream, there's another few billion dollars that we've added on top of that. So frankly, from a cleaning up the tail standpoint, we've made significant progress. Obviously, there's a few more things that we're working on and we'll continue to assess every one of the assets in the portfolio, make sure that they are competitively advantaged. And, you know, frankly, as we look at new investments, we force those investments to compete on an industry-wide basis and make sure that they're advantaged versus the industry and therefore can be a supply product at low cost of supply. We also do that with all of our existing assets. And if they are not competitively positioned on an industry supply curve, then the organization has two options. Either we come up with an advantage investment that makes them more competitive and moves them to the left on the cost of supply curve, or we look to divest. And that process has been ongoing across all of our businesses. And then obviously the timing of when we then take action is a function of realizing the value that we think those divestments should bring. And we're patient. We're not going to rush that process. But I would just say staying after it, being very steady, waiting for the market to meet, to be where it needs to be in order for us to [reevaluate] (ph) it has paid off significantly. And basically, we're delivering on what we said we were going to do, and we'll continue to look at it. But I don't see any big step changes here in the medium-term. Sure. Yes. You broke up just a little bit on that, Devin, but I think I got to gist of your question. If I don't hit the mark then please steer me in a slightly different direction. I think your question around what's required to kind of continue to move along in our investments in the low carbon solution across the portfolio of products that we've been talking about. I would just say, fundamentally we expect in the low carbon businesses -- and in fact, some of these new products that while they contribute to a lower carbon future, they also bring significant value in use in today's application, they have to compete in the portfolio, they have to be advantaged versus what's out there today and they have to basically generate good returns across the commodity cycles. And so the fundamental philosophy that we've been applying in the base business also is required in these -- the new businesses that we are trying to generate. So that's foundational what each of -- and Dan Ammann, in particular but then the stuff that's coming out of the Product Solutions organization, has also got to meet that initial hurdle. And then as you look across each of them, the hurdles to clear to deliver on that expectation vary little bit. I would say in Dan's business with the carbon capture and storage, he and his team are building a brand-new business. And so there are very few, I think examples of where the company is not only developing the technology and the infrastructure and logistics system, but also developing the capacity to supply, while developing the demand and developing the market in general, and advocating on, what I'd say, are the initial policies needed to get things kick started. So there are a lot of moving parts. I would say the broader industry and business community, frankly haven't gotten far enough along this to truly appreciate just how complicated it is. But I'd say leveraging the capacity and capability that we've built over the decades doing this in other parts of our company, particularly in the Upstream, that we are leveraging those capabilities and making really good progress there. On the blue hydrogen project, as we've worked through the engineering -- and we've got a really good line of sight to what that project can deliver. Obviously, a critical element of that is getting the IRA legislation translated into final regulations, and that's a process that's been ongoing. We are optimistic that the regulations will reflect the intent of the legislation. And if it does, I think we'll have a very attractive project that we can then FID here once those regulations are finalized. So I am optimistic in that space. And as you may have seen, we've just added another 500,000 tons of carbon capture and storage into Dan's portfolio. And there is a pipeline that the team continues to work. So we see continued opportunity and growth with good returns in the carbon capture side of the equation. On the lithium same thing -- while lithium is an established market, it's fairly small with respect to what its ultimate potential is. And of course, we are bringing on a new production method with some new technology. And so again, doing the work to understand what the investments required there are and to establish and ensure that we've got a real advantage versus what else is out there and what else needs to come on to meet the growing demand in lithium. But again, I feel good about that. We've told the team, don't -- we're not looking to rush this through and get something, get money spent. We are looking to make sure that we build a very strong long-term foundation. So none of the work that we are doing in these new businesses is schedule-driven. It is all about establishing successful long-term foundations. And then maybe just briefly touch on Proxxima and the Carbon Ventures, which that's a broader effort that we've been on for quite some time, which is to say, leverage our technical capabilities to transform molecules and apply that to markets that exist with unmet needs. And I think we are making really good progress with Proxxima. We've got some, I think very high barriers to entry and competitive advantages there. And so I'm anxious to kind of prosecute that business and establish it as quickly as we can because we see real potential there. And same with Carbon Ventures, again leveraging our ability to transform the molecule, shape the molecules and get some structures that improve performance. I think there is a big opportunity there. So but that's \u2013 I'd say Carbon Ventures is still early in the technology cycle, but I think we've gone far enough along to see some real opportunity there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the challenge I've given the Product Solutions organization is what's a realistic but aggressive business plan look like and what would be the investment required to establish that. And that's good because it grows value today, but it also positions us well. As those molecules become less demanded in their traditional applications, it becomes a much lower feedstock to these new applications. And so there is a lot of opportunity to diversify the [slate] (ph) and protect the business or diversify the business, as we move through the transition. So long answer, but a lot of variables at play here, but frankly, all variables that we feel very comfortable managing. And I think the progress we're making there demonstrates our capability to manage those things. Thank you. Yes. Good morning John. I'll start with that and then let Kathy finish up. But -- so the way -- the reason we put a range out on the CapEx, as we build these plans in the previous year, starting around this time in the summertime and then kind of lock and load them in October. And obviously, there is a lot of things that develop and evolve from the middle of the previous year to -- as go into this year. That range is not meant to have you guys slice it down the middle and fix on a number. The range is to say, we've got optionality here. And as things evolve, we may reduce some of the spending. Or if we find that the opportunities are panning out the way we expect, we may be on the other end. So that range is truly where we expect to be somewhere in -- and how things evolve and what the opportunity set looks like. I mean the key focus here is to make sure that we are investing in highly advantaged, highly profitable projects. And basically, as we worked our way from October of last year into this year, we see a lot of attractive opportunities that we continue to invest in which puts us at the top end of that, consistent with what we understood the opportunity set could look like, as we went into the plan process last year. That's why we are coming in at [2025] (ph). And then of course, we're using the Pioneer number to add on top of that. But Kathy, anything to add to that? So I would say consistent with the plans that we put out, the projects are all with obviously the exception of Golden Pass, moving consistent with the planned development and the announced dates that we talked about. All of them, I think we feel really good about in terms of the work that we're doing. And the case for the contributions, the returns the earnings that we expect to get out of those projects, I think we continue to feel good about. Underpinning all the projects is we'd never try to take a position on where we're going to be in the market cycle, but instead make sure that these projects, when they come on, can compete in any of the areas of the cycle. And we've actually found that, if you look at the investments we've made since 2018 brought online, if you look at the aggregate return of that portfolio, it is exceeding the basis in which we FID-ed those projects. Even as we have been, say in the Chemical business at bottom-of-cycle conditions. So I think we continue to demonstrate to ourselves the time we spend to make sure these projects are advantaged in the best case is paying off. And then, of course our global project organization is really continuing to drive very effective execution of the portfolio with -- keeping our cost well within the FID basis and generally delivering it faster and therefore, bringing more value sooner. Kathy? Yes. Sure. I'll start with the last part of the question, which is it is a conscious decision to get weighted on liquid prices. And frankly, if you look at the LNG market. And when you're building large LNG projects, you tend to sell those out and sign contracts in advance of the investments, which the market today is linked to oil. And so we continue to have a desire to lock in a significant portion of those developments, so we've got surety on the sales side of the equation as we bring those projects up. So my expectation is we'll continue to be weighted on that, and we're very comfortable with that. In fact, there is been a huge drive since I've been in this job and brought Neil into the Upstream to basically shift the portfolio and get a little heavier weighting in the oil side. And as I mentioned, this morning on CNBC, if you look at the oil that we're producing today, we are producing more oil than at any time since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. So that strategy is beginning to manifest itself. On your Golden Pass project, so we've just gotten through -- the venture just reached a settlement with Zachry. And so that venture is in the process of kind of restaffing and getting started back up again. Obviously, we are in the very early days of that. So there is still more work to be done. And of course, the teams are very focused on getting back to work, effectively executing and bringing that project in as quickly as they can and as close to the original schedule as they can. Right now, our estimate is we are going to see about a six month slippage. So we had anticipated kind of first LNG in the middle of next year. We now are looking at probably the back end of 2025 for first LNG. And that is kind of where the current schedule is. But I would just condition that with the teams are just getting back up and running, and they have a clear mandate to try to bring that in as effectively as they can. And my -- again, my expectation is it will do better than we currently think, but we've got work to do. Thank you Biraj. Sure. No, I appreciate the question, Steve, because I think you touched on a really important point. I think one of the advantages of the restructuring that we've done is we no longer identify our business with the products that we are making. So if you go back in time, the functional organizations that we established, every refining organization that was producing refining products, and we had a fuels marketing organization that we marketing fuels, and we had a chemical company that's marketing chemicals. We've now combined all that into a Product Solutions organization, which is supported by a technology organization, which, again is not organized around any of our heritage businesses or heritage products, but instead is organized around core capabilities, core technical capabilities to deliver value to the businesses that they support. So while it may not be intuitively obvious, that change in structure and the way we think about and talk about the business has also opened up a lot of white space in terms of the challenge here is how do we take our core advantages, core capabilities. Some of it includes our existing footprint, but a lot of it includes our ability to upsell and to identify value and use applications, and combine that with a technology organization that's very focused on applying core technology capabilities to business challenges and business opportunities which is starting to unlock applications that frankly, in the past wouldn't have been identified because they didn't fit in the context of the organizations that we had in place. But today the aperture is much broader and the playing field is much bigger. And so we see that with Proxxima and Carbon Ventures. My expectation is as we go forward, we'll continue to talk about those markets, and we'll talk about the applications that we are developing. And the technology organization is continuing to look at how else can we use our capabilities and manipulating the molecules and particularly hydrogen and carbon molecules, to make products that society needs and at the same time reduce emissions. So I think that organization has been given a license, a hunting license go out and find how we can lean into and create more value out there and grow our earnings. So my expectation is as we go forward well beyond the 2027 time frame, we are going to continue to bring in opportunity sets as we unlock them through the work of both our Product Solutions organization but also our technology organization. And then of course, we can take advantage of our Product Solutions organization and then go off and build these things at scale and do it at a lower cost than anybody else. So I think there's a really powerful combination there. And our horizon extends well beyond the 2027 in terms of thinking through the pipeline and making sure that we're positioned to be successful well into the future. And I would just quickly add then -- and that's true for Product Solutions which has got the chemical portfolio, our specialty portfolio. And then what I would say are the energy portfolio, but more specifically the molecules that go into energy, that we expect to become feedstocks of the future like they are today for our Carbon Ventures and Proxxima ventures. On the Upstream side, we've got a lot of, obviously growth potential through the back end of this decade. But we -- this is a depletion business, we recognize that. And so that organization continues to look well beyond the 2027, 2030 time horizon, making sure that we have got a good understanding of what it's going to take to keep that pipeline full. So I feel really good about that. I think the way we've organized the businesses and the central organizations that we've put in place to serve those businesses is going to have huge payoffs here in this space. Sure. Good morning. Roger, I think the key message I would leave you with across our business is when you look at kind of pricing in margins is there's two pieces, two halves to the equation, there is the demand side and there is the supply side. On the demand side, frankly to start with chemicals, we see the demand basically returning to the kind of growth that we've seen prior to the pandemic. So basically growing at 1% to 2% above GDP. And so that's back on track from a growth standpoint. Certainly, that's what we are seeing in the first half of this year. The challenge in that business with the margins has been frankly, from the supply side of the equation. We've got a lot of capacity coming on and a queue of capacity yet to come on. So that's moral of the story in chemicals, less of a demand and growth story and more of a supply story and a lot of supply coming on in the short-term. And like the past, the challenge in the chemical business, given the large chunks of capacity to come on in discrete times, that you've got to grow your -- got to grow through that capacity to get your margins back up again. One of the reasons why we stay so very focused on low cost of supply, feed advantage and, importantly performance products is to make sure that we've got advantages above and beyond the commodity cycle. And you see that playing out on our chemical business with earnings that frankly are well above what would be expected given the challenging market conditions that we see in the margin environment. China is growing despite maybe some of the \u2013 it is not growing at the rates that we've seen historically the very high rates, but still growing at a healthy clip. And as you come around to the US, we are seeing kind of reasonable economic conditions and growth in the US as well. Europe, I think is probably the most challenged area of the globe. And frankly, with some of the policies we see Europe implementing, my expectation is becoming more challenging, quite frankly and unfortunately -- particularly unfortunate for the folks living in Europe given the -- I think, the drag that the policy they are putting in place is going to put on their economy. So I think China is looking reasonable. India is growing and it looks very, very healthy. The US is looking reasonable with good growth. Demand for -- on the energy side of the equation with petroleum products continues to be very high. Record levels of demand around the world. And again, I think very good supply coming into the equation there, which is keeping -- has brought margins from those very high levels that we've seen in the first quarter and then back into last year. We are now getting back down into more typical ranges. And frankly, all of our plans anticipated that. It is always difficult to call the timing of it, but we certainly knew that the elevated margins that we were seeing in the refining business would ultimately come back into normal ranges. My expectation going forward then is we'll continue to see what I would say is historical volatility levels in that. We'll see times when the margins spike and we'll see times. And the margins are challenging. But again, we've built our refining business to be robust to those. And if you look at the work we've been doing to high-grade that portfolio, we've taken out a lot of the low-margin, less advantaged refineries and are now focused on the integrated refineries that have a mix of high value products that we are producing and are advantaged from a size and scale and cost standpoint. And then on the gas side of the equation -- and the oil side of the equation, oil demand continues to be at record levels. Last year was a record. We anticipate this year will be a record, and then next year will be a record. So demand continues to be fairly healthy from an oil standpoint. It is just a question of working through the supply that is coming on. Most of that led by what's happening in the Americas. And then on gas that's going to continue to grow in demand, and it is another -- again, a function of the capacity is coming on. So I think good news is that we are seeing the industry be very responsive to the demand. And frankly, it is very consistent with the foundation of the strategy that we put together, which is you got to be low cost, you got to be on the left hand side of the cost of supply curve. Thanks Roger. Yes. And I would just -- I guess one other way to think about it, Josh is, for the first time in the history of our corporation, we've organized ourselves to take -- to focus on every aspect of delivering the business irrespective of what that business is. Look at where the synergies exist, and are now taking the experience, the collective experience of the corporation and the expertise in each of those areas and focusing it on an opportunity set. So the size of our business, it gives us a huge advantage here. And so a lot of these things you are seeing are accruing by basically taking the best thinking that had occurred in the -- around the organization around the world, and then applying that uniformly everywhere, it is relevant. And that's happening time and time and time again. And so I think a very unique capability and capacity that frankly, others can't match. And the benefits are showing up in these structural cost savings for sure. Also showing up on the revenue side of the equation with respect to better marketing, better ability to sell into value. So there's, I think, a huge benefit to the changes we've been making. Good morning Bob. Yes, that comment I meant to imply for more broadly, the whole low-carbon solutions business that, where as you look at each of those businesses, they've got their unique set of complexities. For lithium, in particular, you are taking what is essentially a brand-new technology, marrying that with some established technologies for subsurface, some established technologies above-surface, consistent with our processing experiences in refining and chemicals. And so putting those things together in a new business to make a product. I wouldn't say has complexities that people can't comprehend. I would just say they're new -- and there haven't been very many people who have worked way through that. Where some really unique challenges are is building brand new value chains. And the carbon capture market, as an example where there's just \u2013 there is not an existing market today that pays for carbon removal that's being incentivized with government policy. Government policy is forming, while at the same time, you are trying to build the infrastructure to support that market, the logistics, the supply and then at the same time, develop a customer base. And so the complexity that I see in the low-carbon space, that's a particularly challenging one because of all the moving parts and all the work that has to be done to try to piece those things together to come up with, frankly, a business and business model that, one, is sustainable for the long term. and two, that generates returns that are competitive in the portfolio. But I have to say, we are geared to do that kind of work. Our experience lends itself to that. And frankly, what Dan and the team is accomplishing leaning on a lot of the core capabilities of the organization, and we are tackling those challenges and making really good progress. I think on the hydrogen side of the equation, there is not a real vibrant market or a strongly economic market for low, virtually carbon-free hydrogen. So that's being developed. Obviously, the government incentives are supporting that in the short term. But we've got to work our way to a market-driven forces, so that we are competing in an open market and not relying on government subsidies. So that's, I think, one of the challenges in that space. But I think my comment was more generally that there is a lot of optimism around the low carbon solution \u2013 low carbon businesses in general. But if you think about where progress has been made to-date, most of that's been in the wind and solar and EV areas. And all of those are playing into well-established markets. The power generation market is very well established. The automotive industry is very well established. Now they are bringing in new technologies that have some of their own unique challenges, but they are not building brand-new markets. In our case, and some of the businesses we are building brand-new markets. You bet Bob."

            "content": "Sure, I think one of the things we've been really pleased by is the number of learnings that we've already had from Pioneer. And so not only will we bring our technology and cube development to them, but they are bringing a bunch of learnings to us. So we're already utilizing their remote logistics operations center in our own drilling and completions operations in order to improve supply chain. They've done some things on the procurement side, I'd say, that we think can help us to kind of leverage up our expertise. They've been really good over the years of locking up their acreage. So we think that's another thing that ultimately we can benefit from. And then as I think everyone knows, they've got a quite large water infrastructure in the Midland Basin. And we'll be looking to also leverage that. So we've been really pleased with what they bring to the table and we're off to a really good start, as we look at building an integration development plan with them that fully utilizes the technology that we bring to the table. And so we're going to have a corporate plan update in December. We are going to do a spotlight on the Upstream, and we'll update where we're at with the synergies and how we are looking forward at that time. Good morning. And the only other thing I'd note, Neil, is you can see in our cash flow bridges every quarter. Sorry. I'm sorry, Doug. I'm sorry. But you can see in our cash flow bridges, we're pretty consistently every quarter bringing in more proceeds from the divestments that are occurring. You know, in the first half of the year that was $1.6 billion. And then I would just note we had a lot of activity in Upstream. And so that generated some positive earnings for us in the quarter. And so if you look at my prepared remarks, you know, that we published earlier this morning, I talk about sort of $380 million in the Upstream being kind of these other one-off items. And that was a lot of earnings coming in from divestments only partially offset by the one-off cost associated with Pioneer. Yeah, good appreciate that. Sorry about that Doug. No, I would just say, obviously we have a lot of projects coming online in 2025 and the exact pace of all of those. And therefore, making sure that we provided sort of enough room, I would say, in the initial guidance supporting of all of those projects that are coming online in 2025. We can't pinpoint, predict all of that as we put our plans together for the year. And so just as an example, China 1 is a huge project. It is going to be coming online early next year as an example. So there is always a little bit of give and take, which is why we give the range to start with. Yes. And I would just note and especially a big year for our [E&PS] (ph) business. So I already noted China 1. You noted a couple of projects. I mean, the Singapore resid upgrade project is a pretty big project. We have an upgrade project at Fawley in order to bring on ultra-low sulfur diesel. We've got the Strathcona project for renewable diesel coming online in 2025. So a really big year for the E&PS business in terms of the number of projects we have coming online. And then we're going to continue to expand our advanced recycling. So we'll be adding more capacity as well next year. So we noted, again if you look at our IR slides, we talk about projects being a big driver of underlying earnings growth in the E&PS business, and you see that supported by everything coming on in 2025. Great. Thanks very much for the question. And so, you're right. If we look on an after-tax basis we had about $600 million overall on a pre basis for the year-to-date where our structural cost savings is about $1 billion. So making really good progress. Continuing to optimize maintenance is a big driver of overall savings. We gave a number of $200 million in energy products in terms of my prepared remarks. And that was just noting that, in the half we had a particularly heavy turnaround slate. And if we looked back at that same turnaround slate the last time we did it, we did it much more quickly and we did it at lower cost. Hence the $200 million savings number that you mentioned. We are also obviously driving savings in terms of supply chain and looking to get more efficient there. And all of our centralized organizations which we've kind of stood up over the last couple of years, are really responsible for driving savings into the business. So whether that's global business solutions or whether that's supply chain, or our global operating and sustainability group, who works on our maintenance activities, we are really starting to see the uptick from the benefit that those organizations can bring, by simplifying things and standardizing things, and bringing better data analytics to optimize our overall organization. So that's what you are going to continue to see on a go-forward basis. And then I'd say, longer-term, as those centralized organizations start to standardize processes for the company which are quite disparate, as we sit here today, we'll be able to apply more technology to get, I'd say, even more automated in the things that we do which will drive further efficiencies for us long term. So whether it is getting more efficient on logistics or getting more efficient because we're standardizing now between ourselves and Pioneer, standardizing all the materials and things that we're buying, those are the things that will continue to drive savings. And I think we have both the largest program, by far of anybody in the industry and now a very proven track record that we feel quite good about typically over delivering on the initial plans that we developed. So we are feeling good about the progress we're making, and that overall target to get to $15 billion in savings between 2019 and 2027."

        "content": "Marina Matselinskaya: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining the call today. I'm Marina Matselinskaya, Director of Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO.\n This presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the first quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location.\n During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website.\n And now please turn to Slide 3 for Darren's remarks. \nDarren Woods: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our strategy and the way our people are executing created significant value in the first quarter. We delivered $8.2 billion of earnings and $14.7 billion of cash flow. Even more important, we continue to strengthen the underlying earnings power of the company, which both Kathy and I will discuss in more detail on today's call.\n An important driver of this improved earnings power is our ongoing focus on structural cost savings, which reached $10.1 billion in the quarter versus 2019, furthering our progress towards our goal of $15 billion by 2027. CapEx in the quarter was $5.8 billion, as we continue to invest in advantaged growth projects that will drive future earnings and cash flow. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet, bringing our net debt-to-capital down to 3%, the lowest in more than a decade.\n To reward our shareholders, we distributed $6.8 billion in cash, including $3.8 billion in dividends. For all of 2023, ExxonMobil was the third largest total dividend payer in the S&P 500. Only Microsoft and Apple paid more. We also repurchased about $3 billion of shares. Buybacks were temporarily paused until the shareholders of Pioneer voted on the combination of our companies, which they approved on February 7. Post close, we expect buybacks to ramp up to a pace of $20 billion a year.\n Our ongoing success this quarter reflects the intense focus we have had for the past 7 years on improving every aspect of our business. We developed a strategy tied more directly to our core competitive advantages. We reorganized the company to create a group of centralized organizations that fully utilize the significant synergies between our businesses. We set and met ambitious plans to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company. And we established a track record of excellence in execution that is second to none.\n All of this has been critical to laying the foundation for further success, both in the current plan period through 2027 and over a much longer growth horizon, which I will discuss in a few minutes. As covered in the corporate plan update in early December, we expect to generate an additional $12 billion in earnings potential from 2023 to 2027 on a constant price and margin basis. That represents a compounded annual earnings growth rate over the plan period of greater than 10%. The drivers of this additional value are clear. Higher volumes from advantaged assets, mix improvements from the shift to higher-value products and further structural cost reductions.\n Within Product Solutions, for example, we expect to start up multiple strategic projects between now and the end of 2025, which will drive significant earnings growth through mix improvements. Consider our Singapore Resid Upgrade Project where our industry first technology application will allow us to transform bottom-of-the-barrel molecules into higher value base stocks significantly lifting margins. Our focus on shareholder value extends beyond the work we're doing to drive profitable growth.\n We're also working hard to ensure that the value we've created is not diminished through third-party actions. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few that occurred in the quarter that attracted some media attention. In Guyana, as the operator of the world's premier deepwater development, we have created tremendous value. We believe the proposed Chevron-Hess transaction and ignoring preemption rights triggered by a change of control, diminishes an element of value due ExxonMobil.\n We believe it's critical to defend these rights and fully preserve the value we've created. The arbitration we filed in the quarter seeks to confirm our rights and establish the value of the transaction places on the Guyana asset. This will allow us to fully evaluate options to maximize the value to ExxonMobil and our shareholders. Any responsible management team would do the same.\n In the quarter, we also initiated litigation against 2 special interest activists masquerading as investors. These activists borrowed or group funded a nominal amount of shares to resubmit a proposal that in previous years had little shareholder support, which is a violation of the SEC's rules. These activists have publicly admitted they are working to stop production of oil and natural gas and have no interest in earning a financial return.\n They hijack an important process that gives small shareholders a voice and are undermining the integrity of the system with an agenda that is not in the best interest of our investors or society, which is why we are actively opposing their efforts. Finally, although it attracted less attention, we successfully defended the Pioneer merger against a frivolous lawsuit designed to extract value from ExxonMobil shareholders.\n A plaintiff's lawyer who sued to block the deal has repeatedly abused a legitimate legal process to extort money from companies to have his lawsuit withdrawn. We refused to pay this \"merger tax\". The court ruled in our favor, finding that filing a lawsuit solely to gain leverage in the settlement negotiation is an improper purpose. Even more important, the court sanctioned the lawyer for operating in bad faith in order him to pay ExxonMobil's legal fees, which will hopefully discourage similar frivolous lawsuits in the future. While results of these efforts may not show up in any discrete quarterly result, they underpin long-term value and demonstrate our strong commitment to doing what's right.\n Turning to another area of strong commitment that shows up every quarter, is our focus on functional excellence, a core competitive advantage and a key pillar of our strategy. In Guyana, it's delivering unprecedented success and value creation, reflected in the startup of the Prosperity FPSO last November, ahead of schedule and below cost. As with our 2 previous developments, this cost and schedule performance was industry-leading. The excellence in execution demonstrated in delivering a project continued into its operation.\n With Prosperity, we reached nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels a day in January, just 2 months after startup and well ahead of the industry average of 15 months. Once our projects are up and running, we continually look for debottlenecking opportunities to increase production. All 3 FPSOs are now producing above their funding basis, helping to drive record gross production in the first quarter, all with an emissions intensity amongst the lowest in our upstream portfolio.\n Looking ahead, we're pleased that our sixth project, Whiptail, has now reached FID with a planned start-up by year-end 2027. It's remarkable to think that within 8 years of first oil, Guyana will have a production capacity of more than 1.3 million barrels per day. Our work in Guyana is delivering tangible benefits for the Guyanese people. The development of Guyana's energy economy drove the highest real GDP growth in the world in 2022. The oil and gas industry is directly supporting thousands of local suppliers and Guyanese workers.\n And our gas-to-energy project will feed a new government-owned power plant with the potential to significantly increase reliability and reduce both the cost of electricity and its greenhouse gas emissions. As I said at CERAWeek last month, I believe Guyana will go down as one of the most successful deep water developments in the history of the industry.\n The final point I'd like to make about our upstream business this morning involves our Canada operations. With the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion scheduled to come online May 1, our production from Kearl will have better access to markets in Asia and the U.S. West Coast, which we expect will improve margins and drive higher earnings in future quarters. \n Product Solutions also demonstrated excellence in execution this quarter. Overall, we generated record first quarter refining throughput during a period of peak turnaround activity. Thanks to the outstanding work of our team, we maintained strong turnaround cost and schedule performance. The structural improvements made in turnarounds would not have been possible with our decision to create centralized organizations that are now critical elements of our success. We've been able to take our best thinking and experience from across the corporation and apply it to some of our biggest challenges like these very large maintenance events.\n We've eliminated silos, consolidated expertise and narrowed our focus to the challenges and opportunities with the highest value. Our turnaround performance is translating to both structural cost savings and higher throughput, helping us capture more value from the market than peers, especially at a time of historically high refining margins.\n Finally, our commitment to execution excellence is delivering significant improvements in our environmental performance. Our methane emissions intensity is down more than 60% since 2016. One of the many steps we took included replacing all 6,000-plus natural gas-driven pneumatic devices in our Permian unconventional operated assets. Disciplined execution is critical to success when markets are weak and margins are low. It pays even bigger dividends when the market environment is constructive as it was in the first quarter for crude and refining.\n Crude prices remained roughly flat near the middle of the 10-year range. More recently, the market for crude has tightened with ongoing concerns about the Middle East, putting a floor into prices, which are up more than 10% year-to-date. Natural gas prices move back inside the 10-year range on high inventory and lower demand. Refining margins rose back to the top of the 10-year range as demand grew while industry downtime and global disruptions weighed on supply. Chemical margins were relatively flat as demand growth is being met with new capacity.\n While short-term market conditions are an important context for quarterly results, it's how we position ourselves to leverage the long-term fundamentals that drive sustained shareholder value. I'd like to turn to this for a moment now and plan to spend more time over the year reminding everyone of our attractive growth opportunities that extend well beyond this year and our planned period.\n I know there's a view that we're in a declining industry. That view is wrong. People don't fully appreciate the scale of the global energy system. It took many tens of trillions of dollars to build and today takes more than $2 trillion a year to sustain. This doesn't mean we shouldn't address the emissions challenge. In fact, the world needs to do more in a far more serious way to meet society's emission reduction ambitions. But it also means that oil and natural gas will play a much greater role than the market thinks.\n By 2050, the world is expected to add nearly 2 billion people and the size of the global economy is expected to double from roughly $90 trillion to $180 trillion. Scenarios like IEA Net Zero to see oil demand falling from more than 100 million barrels per day now to 25 million barrels per day in 2050, are not realistic. Even if demand for transportation fuels declined significantly with greater penetration of electric vehicles, the market for petrochemicals is expected to double.\n While the transition to a lower emissions future will be long, there's no denying, it's happening. The question is, who will capture the value. We believe the same competitive advantages that have underpinned ExxonMobil's success for more than 100 years, will serve as the foundation for building a range of world-class businesses in a lower emissions world.\n As I've said many times, we're a technology company at our core. We transform molecules at scale to meet society's needs. The notion that the world can electrify everything is misguided. Molecules will play a dominant role in the energy, materials and products the world needs in 2050 and beyond. At our low carbon solutions spotlight last year, we'll walk you through the opportunity we saw in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Since that time, we've also entered the market for lithium. The total addressable market in these areas going forward is potentially in the trillions of dollars.\n Today, I'd like to mention some of the additional areas we're exploring that have tremendous potential. We discussed each of these opportunities in detail with our Board of Directors during a visit to our Baytown complex in March. The world has become increasingly focused on the challenge of mismanaged plastic waste. The solution requires a sound policy, responsible manufacturing, expanded waste management infrastructure and new technologies like those that underpin our advanced recycling projects.\n We have 12 projects in our plants to help us meet the growing demand for processing plastic waste. Our first project at Baytown is one of the largest in North America, with the ability to process 80 million pounds per year of plastic waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill. By breaking down plastic waste into its constituent molecules, our technology significantly widens the range of plastics that can be processed, including hard recycled materials such as potato chip bags and astro turf. We are planning to develop more than 1 billion pounds per year of plastic waste processing capacity by 2027.\n Another growth area is Proxima, which was showcased at our Product Solutions spotlight last September. With Proxima, we transform lower-value gasoline molecules into a high-performance, high-value resin with numerous commercial applications. In short, Proxima is a new chemistry for an enduring challenge, making materials that are lighter, stronger and more durable with lower GHD emissions.\n Proxima is up to 4x stronger than steel and 7x lighter, making an excellent replacement for rebar. As a protective coating, it takes one application in 5 minutes to cure versus 2 to 3 applications with 8 hours in between. It has multiple light weighting applications in the automotive sector, and it has half the life cycle emissions of traditional thermoset resin systems. For us, Proxima is an advantaged fuels to Performance Chemicals business that we plan to scale and build into a global brand.\n We see an addressable market of up to 5 million tonnes per year, growing faster than GDP, with earnings potential of $1 billion a year by 2040 and returns above 15%.\n We are also exploring opportunities materials made from carbon which, as the world decarbonizes, will become an increasingly advantaged feedstock. We launched a technology venture about 2 years ago to assess attractive new markets for carbon products. We see opportunities to transform the molecular structure of low-value carbon-rich feeds from refining and petrochemical processes to create high-value products for growing markets. Some of these markets include carbon fiber, polymer additives, battery materials and electrodes for steel production. We are specifically focused on high-value segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates more than double GDP.\n One potential opportunity is the carbon materials used in batteries and energy storage solutions. With demand for this segment growing above 10% per year, these carbon materials are expected to be in short supply. Additionally, as the needs for storage solutions evolve, there will be an increasing demand for higher-performance carbon materials. The carbon-rich feedstock available in ExxonMobil's existing businesses coupled with our core technology capabilities and complementary lithium offering positions us to meet the growing demand and deliver product performance improvements required for the battery and energy storage solutions of the future.\n The last technology I'll touch on today is Direct Air Capture or DAC. For the world to reach Net Zero, negative emissions technologies are going to be needed, none holds greater long-term promise than DAC. The challenges, however, are as big as the opportunity. Atmospheric CO2 is extremely diluted at about 425 parts per million, a massive amount of air has to be processed to remove a single ton of carbon dioxide.\n Today, many technologies are competing to crack the code and make DAC scalable and affordable. Our scientists and engineers are hard at work on this problem. We've launched a pilot project at Baytown that has demonstrated feasibility with the use of a proprietary capture process. Our initial goal is to cut the cost in half, which will still be too expensive, but will help move us down the cost curve. The current market for DAC is tiny, at less than 10,000 tons per year of CO2 captured, but the long-term potential is huge.\n We are excited that dozens of companies and universities are chasing direct air capture solutions. We wish them all success irrespective of where the breakthrough occurs or who achieves it. ExxonMobil will have an important role to play.\n As we've demonstrated, there are a few, if any, companies better positioned than us to globally deploy a molecule technology at scale with attractive returns. People who limit our future to the products and markets we are in today, have lost sight of our past and don't understand our core capabilities or advantages or the future potential they hold.\n Consider our Baytown low carbon hydrogen project, which is entering advanced stages of engineering and development. We are not only focused on building the supply side of this new market for low carbon hydrogen, but are also making strong progress in building large-scale demand as demonstrated in our MOUs for offtake of low-carbon ammonia with SK of South Korea and JERA of Japan.\n The last piece required to bring this project in market to life is government policy that maintains a level playing field across all methods of hydrogen production. Without this, we cannot and will not move forward. On the other hand, if incentives are developed to establish a viable technology neutral market, our advantages will allow us to generate attractive returns and invest more, accelerating customers' emissions reduction.\n Over ExxonMobil's entire history and across the globe, we've built industries and value chains where none previously existed. We will continue to do this. In a fast transition, we'll grow earnings and cash flow with accelerated investments in CCS, hydrogen, biofuels and DAC. In a slow transition, we'll grow earnings and cash flow through advantaged investments in our traditional businesses. In irrespective of the transition pace, we'll extend our reach to new high-value markets with innovative new products. Under any scenario, we are convinced that our company is uniquely positioned to play a leading role, meeting the world's essential needs for energy and high-value materials and products.\n With that, I'll hand it over to Kathy. \nKathryn Mikells: Thanks, Darren. We've established a consistent track record of improving the earnings power of our business. Across the company, our teams have been laser-focused on investing in competitively advantaged, low cost of supply, high-return opportunities delivering execution excellence in everything we do and driving additional structural cost improvements.\n Our earnings growth over the past 4 years was more than twice the pace of our closest peer. As of year-end 2023, we more than doubled earnings, bringing an incremental $14 billion to our bottom line on a constant price and margin basis versus 2019. As Darren noted, over the next 4 years, we plan to increase earnings potential by an additional $12 billion or a CAGR of more than 10%.\n Our ability to deliver industry-leading earnings growth reflects our unique competitive advantages, consistent strategy and the differentiated execution capabilities our people bring every single day. We've demonstrated our ability to improve the profitability of the business by reshaping our portfolio, divesting noncore assets, investing in accretive high profit opportunities and driving structural cost savings.\n This quarter, we've included a few additional slides to remind you of the plans we discussed during the corporate plan update last December and to demonstrate the progress we've been making. Going forward, we'll provide you with regular updates on these metrics.\n The drivers of our expected earnings growth are clear. Additional structural cost savings reductions of over $5 billion versus year-end 2023, higher volumes and more profitable barrels from advantaged assets like Guyana and the Permian in the upstream and execution of strategic projects and product solutions that enhance our product mix driving exceptional growth in high-value products.\n As I said during the corporate plan update in December last year, to win in our business, we must be a low-cost operator. That means continually finding ways to become even more efficient. With more than $10 billion in structural cost improvements as of the first quarter of 2024, split roughly 50-50 between upstream and product solutions, we're making steady progress towards the incremental $5 billion we're working to deliver by 2027.\n And we are on track to further extend that industry-leading performance. These structural cost savings have not only mitigated the impact of inflation, but have helped to offset the cost of new projects. Our success is meaningfully improving our operating cost and driving higher earnings for both upstream and product solutions.\n In fact, we ended last year with our cash operating expenses, excluding energy cost and production taxes down $4.5 billion versus 2019. We have a clear line of sight to achieve the roughly $1.5 billion in annual savings contained in our plan, and our team has a track record of beating our targets.\n We're leveraging our global organizations, including our Global Operations and Sustainability Group and the global business solutions and global supply chain organizations that we stood up last year. These organizations are tasked with realizing savings across all of our businesses. We're optimizing our turnarounds and other scheduled maintenance activities. We're streamlining and automating our order to cash, procure to pay, record to report and our planning processes.\n And we're better leveraging the scale of our supply chain to improve the efficiency of our logistics movements, enhance our buying power and lower the level of materials and inventory that we need to run our operations. We have a proven track record and a high level of confidence in our plan, and more importantly, in our team's ability to deliver.\n In the Upstream, on a stand-alone basis, we're on track to double earnings potential by 2027 compared to 2019 on a constant price basis, as we reshape our portfolio, divesting noncore assets and growing production from industry-leading assets that offer lower cost of supply, lower life cycle emissions and higher returns. Between 2019 and 2023, we've pruned Upstream's portfolio of nonstrategic assets, including U.S. flowing gas and focused on developing advantaged assets such as Guyana, the Permian, LNG and Brazil.\n For example, since 2019, we've more than doubled production volume in the Permian. In Guyana, we started 2019 with 0 production volumes. This quarter, we delivered more than 600 kbd of gross production. These efforts have resulted in a significant Upstream mix improvement. Our share of total production from advantaged assets has risen from 28% to 44%. We expect to grow Upstream earnings by an additional 50% between 2023 and 2027. That growth is driven by further production mix improvement, incremental cost savings and production growth.\n We expect our stand-alone production in 2024 to be about 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, rising to about 4.2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2027, as growth from advantaged assets more than offset base depletion. Since 2019, we've nearly doubled Upstream unit profitability at constant price from $5 per oil-equivalent barrel to $9 as of the first quarter of 2024. We expect unit profitability to increase to $13 per oil-equivalent barrel by 2027. Unit earnings from our advantaged assets are expected to be $9 per barrel higher than our base portfolio by 2027 at constant prices.\n Moving to Product Solutions. We're focused on nearly tripling earnings from 2019 to 2027. We're well on our way to achieving that, having more than doubled earnings potential at the halfway mark at the end of last year. As an Upstream, a key driver of our earnings growth is improving our mix. The strategic projects we're executing do just that. Projects like the China Chemical Complex and the renewable diesel project in Strathcona will increase our high-value product volumes, which command a 10% to 25% margin premium. Projects such as our Singapore Resid Upgrade will also improve our mix without increasing overall volumes by converting low-margin products like fuel oil to higher-margin products like base stocks, diesel and chemical feed. This, in addition to structural cost savings, is the key to further growing our earnings.\n We have a clear line of sight on the nearly $5 billion in earnings from strategic projects in 2027. Through 2023, we delivered nearly 1/3 of our goal. In 2024, we'll see a full year of earnings benefit from the Beaumont refinery expansion and Permian Crude Venture. On the chart, you can see the annualized first quarter contributions from these and other projects that we brought online since 2019.\n As we highlighted on our earnings call last quarter, 2025 is a big year for strategic project start-ups, which will provide a further large boost in earnings growth. Given the track record of our global projects and centralized technology organizations, we're confident in our ability to execute this plan, which delivers the capacity needed to double high-value product sales. By 2027, we expect high-value products to deliver about 40% of Product Solutions total earnings.\n Turning to the quarter, I'll start with a high-level review of sequential earnings. Details by business segments are available in the backup to this presentation. I'm then going to spend a bit of time discussing our earnings year-on-year, which I think better highlights the progress that we're making in the key areas that drive our underlying earnings growth over the medium term. You'll see that we're providing more detail on what impacts our volumes and costs period-to-period to more clearly link our current performance to the earnings growth drivers that I discussed earlier. We provided definitions of these factors and the backup to this presentation.\n First quarter GAAP earnings were $8.2 billion, excluding identified items, earnings were down $1.8 billion sequentially. Timing effects were $1 billion unfavorable impact this quarter, mostly related to unsettled derivatives mark-to-market impacts consistent with this quarter's increase in oil prices. Other items, largely noncash, were $600 million or $0.15 per share hurt this quarter, driven mainly by noncash impacts from tax and inventory balance sheet adjustments.\n Base volumes were lower in the quarter as entitlement impacts fewer days in the quarter and the impact of higher scheduled maintenance were partially offset by growth from advantaged assets and strategic projects. Looking at the first quarter performance versus the same quarter last year, you can clearly see the contributions from growing advantaged assets and executing our strategic projects as well as our underlying structural cost improvements.\n GAAP earnings of $8.2 billion were down more than $3 billion versus our record first quarter earnings reported last year. The decline was driven by lower industry gas prices and refining and chemical margins, as well as higher maintenance and negative timing impacts from higher oil prices and the noncash expenses that I mentioned earlier.\n We made good progress continuing to improve the underlying earnings power of the business. We saw a strong growth from our advantaged assets like Guyana and projects like the Beaumont refinery expansion, which roughly offset lower base volumes that reflect divestments, entitlements and curtailments in the Upstream and divestments and higher maintenance in energy products. We added $400 million of structural cost savings this quarter, which resulted in an after-tax earnings benefit of $300 million.\n Now let's turn to the segments to dive further into our performance. In the Upstream, lower gas realizations were partly offset by slightly higher liquid realizations. As Darren mentioned, oil and natural gas prices in the quarter were about at the middle of the 10-year range. Our excellence in execution is delivering results. Higher volumes from advantaged assets more than offset divestment, curtailment and entitlement impacts, contributing $430 million in earnings versus the first quarter last year.\n In Guyana, we delivered 3 development projects, bringing online over 600 kbd of gross oil production since initial discovery at an industry-leading pace and cost. This quarter, gross production for Payara ramped up to 220 Kbd design capacity well ahead of schedule. We've also announced a new exploration discovery, Bluefin. Earnings also benefited from about $90 million in additional structural cost savings, driven by operational efficiency gains and reduced expenses from divested assets.\n Our Kearl operation in Canada is a great example of how we're reducing production costs. Last year, we converted our entire fleet of about 80 heavy haul trucks to a fully autonomous operation. The automation program enables us to capture improvements in truck productivity, further enhance safety of our operations and structurally reduce our operating costs. With this program, Kearl now operates the largest autonomous fleet in our industry and one of the largest autonomous mining fleets in the world. And we continue to look at other opportunities to expand automation across our production footprint.\n Kearl's gross production in the first quarter was 277 Kbd, which was a record for a first quarter. 2023 average gross production of 270 Kbd was also a record annual production. Higher expenses of $160 million were driven by an increase in depreciation rates in U.S. unconventional, while other, which is largely noncash, reflects the absence of favorable tax and divestment adjustments last year and inventory adjustments this quarter.\n Timing effects in the Upstream had a negative $120 million impact on the quarter, compared to a negative $490 million impact last year, driven by our mark-to-market position on our derivatives portfolio.\n In Product Solutions, we're high-grading our portfolio by divesting nonstrategic sites and investing where we have competitive advantages. Energy Products delivered roughly $1.4 billion in earnings in the quarter. Our advantaged configuration and commercial logistics capabilities enabled a dynamic response to the changing macro environment, which saw industry margins decline versus last year, primarily due to additional supply and normalizing trade flows.\n The strategic projects we executed last year, expanding our Beaumont refinery and completing the Permian Crude pipeline, helped us achieve record first quarter refining throughput and contributed to the $140 million earnings improvement. High-grading our portfolio also means making some tough but necessary choices to improve long-term competitiveness. Divestments in the middle of last year impacted volumes, but also contributed to structural cost savings in the period.\n We recently announced additional rationalizations in France and Germany to further strengthen our portfolio. As Darren mentioned, we saw a high level of turnaround activity in the quarter, which is reflected in expenses. We're really proud of our team who delivered best ever execution of our recent slate of turnarounds. As expected in a rising price environment, we saw negative timing effects which are primarily related to the mark-to-market on unsettled derivatives. Last year, the timing impact was favorable as prices were falling at that time. These impacts unwind over time.\n Chemical products earned nearly $800 million this quarter, more than double the result from the prior year period. While global polyethylene and polypropylene margins decreased, we drove a sizable margin increase largely due to our advantaged footprint but also due to increased contributions from Performance Products. Higher earnings from high-value product volumes reflect the many investments we've made over the years.\n Gulf Coast growth ventures in Corpus Christi, North American polypropylene and Baton Rouge and our Baytown Chemical expansion, all contribute to this growth. Base volumes increased on the absence of prior period turnarounds, but also on strong reliability in the U.S. Gulf Coast that enabled additional sales when others in the region were negatively impacted by winter storms in January.\n Specialty Products continued to deliver consistently strong earnings coming in at $760 million this quarter. Our efforts to grow margins through feed optimization and revenue management were evident this quarter and largely made possible by the differentiated performance of our high-value products. We had a strong contribution from the finished lubricants business, which is celebrating the 50-year anniversary of Mobil 1, our flagship brand.\n Our rigorous focus on structural cost reductions partially offset higher base expenses. The improved earnings power in our businesses translates to strong cash flow and our consistent capital allocation philosophy enables exceptional long-term shareholder returns. We generated $14.7 billion in cash flow from operations and $10.1 billion of free cash flow during the first quarter, and we continue to deploy that capital, consistent with our allocation priorities.\n First and foremost, our CapEx deployment supports investments in competitively advantaged opportunities that drive long-term earnings and cash flow growth. To sustain growth, we need to be investing now in low cost of supply, high-return, resilient projects. We're doing just that with multiple project startups planned for 2025 and that will contribute nearly $4 billion in earnings potential in 2027 at constant prices and margins. Our cash CapEx for the quarter came in at $5.3 billion.\n Secondly, to stay on the offensive through the commodity cycles, we need to maintain a bulletproof balance sheet. During the first quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of bond maturities, bringing our debt-to-capital down to 16% and our net debt-to-capital ratio down to 3%. This outstanding balance sheet strength gives us ample optionality to capitalize on attractive opportunities regardless of where the market moves.\n And finally, strong operational results coupled with a healthy balance sheet, not only provide flexibility to invest through the cycles, but also to consistently return excess cash to our shareholders. We distributed $6.8 billion in the first quarter, including $3.8 billion in dividends. And while we briefly paused share repurchases following the Pioneer S-4 filing in January, we resumed in February and are on track to complete our $17.5 billion stand-alone share repurchase program this year. As a reminder, we intend to increase the pace of the program to $20 billion per year after the Pioneer transaction closes, assuming reasonable market conditions. These distributions matter. They help to drive our industry-leading total shareholder return and over a longer period of time, significantly reduce our share count.\n Since we began the program in 2022, we reduced our share count by about 7% and or 8% excluding the shares issued for the Denbury acquisition. Looking ahead, our team's execution excellence, our stellar balance sheet and our extended reach to new high-value, high-growth markets uniquely positions us to grow long-term value.\n Turning to the second quarter outlook items. We expect seasonal scheduled maintenance to lower upstream volumes by about 40 KOEBD. This does not impact our 2024 full year production guidance, which is 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels a day. This guidance excludes Pioneer, which we still anticipate will close in the second quarter.\n In Product Solutions, we expect lower scheduled maintenance as we exit the peak of the 2024 turnaround season. We expect corporate and financing expenses to total $300 million to $500 million, in line with the first quarter. We also anticipate an unfavorable working capital impact of about $3 billion from seasonal cash tax payments, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of last year.\n With that, let me go ahead and turn it back to Darren. \nDarren Woods: Thanks, Kathy. I'll leave you with a few key takeaways. Our work to improve the fundamental earnings power of ExxonMobil is continuing a pace. By executing with excellence on our strategy, we expect to grow our earnings potential by an additional $12 billion from 2023 to 2027 at constant prices and margins, a growth rate of more than 10% per year. A significant driver of this earnings growth will be our delivery of additional structural cost savings totaling $15 billion by 2027.\n In the quarter, we continue to deliver unprecedented success in Guyana, with growing production creating additional value for our shareholders and the Guyanese people. Our strategic projects, which are another important driver of our planned earnings improvement, helped deliver record first quarter refining throughput and strong Performance Chemicals volume growth. And there are more projects planned for start-up in 2025. All of this is without the contribution of Pioneer.\n With Pioneer, we'll be positioned to drive earnings, cash flow and shareholder distributions even higher. We continue to work constructively with the FTC as they conduct a very thorough review and remain confident that no competition issues should hinder the transaction. We've been working diligently on our integration plans, and we're ready to begin executing day 1 on the significant synergies this combination will create.\n Looking beyond our plan period and into the future, we see attractive large-scale opportunities to leverage our core capabilities in our existing businesses and in brand-new markets with brand-new products, something our competitors can't do.\n The success of this company and our unique set of competitive advantages is built on our greatest strength and most important advantage, great people. They are the best team in the business. Able to successfully overcome any challenge. Through their work at ExxonMobil, they are making a positive difference in the world, meeting people's essential needs for energy and products today and far into the future. I'm extremely proud to represent them and cannot thank them enough.",

            "name": "Kathryn Mikells",
            "content": "Thanks, Darren. We've established a consistent track record of improving the earnings power of our business. Across the company, our teams have been laser-focused on investing in competitively advantaged, low cost of supply, high-return opportunities delivering execution excellence in everything we do and driving additional structural cost improvements.\n Our earnings growth over the past 4 years was more than twice the pace of our closest peer. As of year-end 2023, we more than doubled earnings, bringing an incremental $14 billion to our bottom line on a constant price and margin basis versus 2019. As Darren noted, over the next 4 years, we plan to increase earnings potential by an additional $12 billion or a CAGR of more than 10%.\n Our ability to deliver industry-leading earnings growth reflects our unique competitive advantages, consistent strategy and the differentiated execution capabilities our people bring every single day. We've demonstrated our ability to improve the profitability of the business by reshaping our portfolio, divesting noncore assets, investing in accretive high profit opportunities and driving structural cost savings.\n This quarter, we've included a few additional slides to remind you of the plans we discussed during the corporate plan update last December and to demonstrate the progress we've been making. Going forward, we'll provide you with regular updates on these metrics.\n The drivers of our expected earnings growth are clear. Additional structural cost savings reductions of over $5 billion versus year-end 2023, higher volumes and more profitable barrels from advantaged assets like Guyana and the Permian in the upstream and execution of strategic projects and product solutions that enhance our product mix driving exceptional growth in high-value products.\n As I said during the corporate plan update in December last year, to win in our business, we must be a low-cost operator. That means continually finding ways to become even more efficient. With more than $10 billion in structural cost improvements as of the first quarter of 2024, split roughly 50-50 between upstream and product solutions, we're making steady progress towards the incremental $5 billion we're working to deliver by 2027.\n And we are on track to further extend that industry-leading performance. These structural cost savings have not only mitigated the impact of inflation, but have helped to offset the cost of new projects. Our success is meaningfully improving our operating cost and driving higher earnings for both upstream and product solutions.\n In fact, we ended last year with our cash operating expenses, excluding energy cost and production taxes down $4.5 billion versus 2019. We have a clear line of sight to achieve the roughly $1.5 billion in annual savings contained in our plan, and our team has a track record of beating our targets.\n We're leveraging our global organizations, including our Global Operations and Sustainability Group and the global business solutions and global supply chain organizations that we stood up last year. These organizations are tasked with realizing savings across all of our businesses. We're optimizing our turnarounds and other scheduled maintenance activities. We're streamlining and automating our order to cash, procure to pay, record to report and our planning processes.\n And we're better leveraging the scale of our supply chain to improve the efficiency of our logistics movements, enhance our buying power and lower the level of materials and inventory that we need to run our operations. We have a proven track record and a high level of confidence in our plan, and more importantly, in our team's ability to deliver.\n In the Upstream, on a stand-alone basis, we're on track to double earnings potential by 2027 compared to 2019 on a constant price basis, as we reshape our portfolio, divesting noncore assets and growing production from industry-leading assets that offer lower cost of supply, lower life cycle emissions and higher returns. Between 2019 and 2023, we've pruned Upstream's portfolio of nonstrategic assets, including U.S. flowing gas and focused on developing advantaged assets such as Guyana, the Permian, LNG and Brazil.\n For example, since 2019, we've more than doubled production volume in the Permian. In Guyana, we started 2019 with 0 production volumes. This quarter, we delivered more than 600 kbd of gross production. These efforts have resulted in a significant Upstream mix improvement. Our share of total production from advantaged assets has risen from 28% to 44%. We expect to grow Upstream earnings by an additional 50% between 2023 and 2027. That growth is driven by further production mix improvement, incremental cost savings and production growth.\n We expect our stand-alone production in 2024 to be about 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, rising to about 4.2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2027, as growth from advantaged assets more than offset base depletion. Since 2019, we've nearly doubled Upstream unit profitability at constant price from $5 per oil-equivalent barrel to $9 as of the first quarter of 2024. We expect unit profitability to increase to $13 per oil-equivalent barrel by 2027. Unit earnings from our advantaged assets are expected to be $9 per barrel higher than our base portfolio by 2027 at constant prices.\n Moving to Product Solutions. We're focused on nearly tripling earnings from 2019 to 2027. We're well on our way to achieving that, having more than doubled earnings potential at the halfway mark at the end of last year. As an Upstream, a key driver of our earnings growth is improving our mix. The strategic projects we're executing do just that. Projects like the China Chemical Complex and the renewable diesel project in Strathcona will increase our high-value product volumes, which command a 10% to 25% margin premium. Projects such as our Singapore Resid Upgrade will also improve our mix without increasing overall volumes by converting low-margin products like fuel oil to higher-margin products like base stocks, diesel and chemical feed. This, in addition to structural cost savings, is the key to further growing our earnings.\n We have a clear line of sight on the nearly $5 billion in earnings from strategic projects in 2027. Through 2023, we delivered nearly 1/3 of our goal. In 2024, we'll see a full year of earnings benefit from the Beaumont refinery expansion and Permian Crude Venture. On the chart, you can see the annualized first quarter contributions from these and other projects that we brought online since 2019.\n As we highlighted on our earnings call last quarter, 2025 is a big year for strategic project start-ups, which will provide a further large boost in earnings growth. Given the track record of our global projects and centralized technology organizations, we're confident in our ability to execute this plan, which delivers the capacity needed to double high-value product sales. By 2027, we expect high-value products to deliver about 40% of Product Solutions total earnings.\n Turning to the quarter, I'll start with a high-level review of sequential earnings. Details by business segments are available in the backup to this presentation. I'm then going to spend a bit of time discussing our earnings year-on-year, which I think better highlights the progress that we're making in the key areas that drive our underlying earnings growth over the medium term. You'll see that we're providing more detail on what impacts our volumes and costs period-to-period to more clearly link our current performance to the earnings growth drivers that I discussed earlier. We provided definitions of these factors and the backup to this presentation.\n First quarter GAAP earnings were $8.2 billion, excluding identified items, earnings were down $1.8 billion sequentially. Timing effects were $1 billion unfavorable impact this quarter, mostly related to unsettled derivatives mark-to-market impacts consistent with this quarter's increase in oil prices. Other items, largely noncash, were $600 million or $0.15 per share hurt this quarter, driven mainly by noncash impacts from tax and inventory balance sheet adjustments.\n Base volumes were lower in the quarter as entitlement impacts fewer days in the quarter and the impact of higher scheduled maintenance were partially offset by growth from advantaged assets and strategic projects. Looking at the first quarter performance versus the same quarter last year, you can clearly see the contributions from growing advantaged assets and executing our strategic projects as well as our underlying structural cost improvements.\n GAAP earnings of $8.2 billion were down more than $3 billion versus our record first quarter earnings reported last year. The decline was driven by lower industry gas prices and refining and chemical margins, as well as higher maintenance and negative timing impacts from higher oil prices and the noncash expenses that I mentioned earlier.\n We made good progress continuing to improve the underlying earnings power of the business. We saw a strong growth from our advantaged assets like Guyana and projects like the Beaumont refinery expansion, which roughly offset lower base volumes that reflect divestments, entitlements and curtailments in the Upstream and divestments and higher maintenance in energy products. We added $400 million of structural cost savings this quarter, which resulted in an after-tax earnings benefit of $300 million.\n Now let's turn to the segments to dive further into our performance. In the Upstream, lower gas realizations were partly offset by slightly higher liquid realizations. As Darren mentioned, oil and natural gas prices in the quarter were about at the middle of the 10-year range. Our excellence in execution is delivering results. Higher volumes from advantaged assets more than offset divestment, curtailment and entitlement impacts, contributing $430 million in earnings versus the first quarter last year.\n In Guyana, we delivered 3 development projects, bringing online over 600 kbd of gross oil production since initial discovery at an industry-leading pace and cost. This quarter, gross production for Payara ramped up to 220 Kbd design capacity well ahead of schedule. We've also announced a new exploration discovery, Bluefin. Earnings also benefited from about $90 million in additional structural cost savings, driven by operational efficiency gains and reduced expenses from divested assets.\n Our Kearl operation in Canada is a great example of how we're reducing production costs. Last year, we converted our entire fleet of about 80 heavy haul trucks to a fully autonomous operation. The automation program enables us to capture improvements in truck productivity, further enhance safety of our operations and structurally reduce our operating costs. With this program, Kearl now operates the largest autonomous fleet in our industry and one of the largest autonomous mining fleets in the world. And we continue to look at other opportunities to expand automation across our production footprint.\n Kearl's gross production in the first quarter was 277 Kbd, which was a record for a first quarter. 2023 average gross production of 270 Kbd was also a record annual production. Higher expenses of $160 million were driven by an increase in depreciation rates in U.S. unconventional, while other, which is largely noncash, reflects the absence of favorable tax and divestment adjustments last year and inventory adjustments this quarter.\n Timing effects in the Upstream had a negative $120 million impact on the quarter, compared to a negative $490 million impact last year, driven by our mark-to-market position on our derivatives portfolio.\n In Product Solutions, we're high-grading our portfolio by divesting nonstrategic sites and investing where we have competitive advantages. Energy Products delivered roughly $1.4 billion in earnings in the quarter. Our advantaged configuration and commercial logistics capabilities enabled a dynamic response to the changing macro environment, which saw industry margins decline versus last year, primarily due to additional supply and normalizing trade flows.\n The strategic projects we executed last year, expanding our Beaumont refinery and completing the Permian Crude pipeline, helped us achieve record first quarter refining throughput and contributed to the $140 million earnings improvement. High-grading our portfolio also means making some tough but necessary choices to improve long-term competitiveness. Divestments in the middle of last year impacted volumes, but also contributed to structural cost savings in the period.\n We recently announced additional rationalizations in France and Germany to further strengthen our portfolio. As Darren mentioned, we saw a high level of turnaround activity in the quarter, which is reflected in expenses. We're really proud of our team who delivered best ever execution of our recent slate of turnarounds. As expected in a rising price environment, we saw negative timing effects which are primarily related to the mark-to-market on unsettled derivatives. Last year, the timing impact was favorable as prices were falling at that time. These impacts unwind over time.\n Chemical products earned nearly $800 million this quarter, more than double the result from the prior year period. While global polyethylene and polypropylene margins decreased, we drove a sizable margin increase largely due to our advantaged footprint but also due to increased contributions from Performance Products. Higher earnings from high-value product volumes reflect the many investments we've made over the years.\n Gulf Coast growth ventures in Corpus Christi, North American polypropylene and Baton Rouge and our Baytown Chemical expansion, all contribute to this growth. Base volumes increased on the absence of prior period turnarounds, but also on strong reliability in the U.S. Gulf Coast that enabled additional sales when others in the region were negatively impacted by winter storms in January.\n Specialty Products continued to deliver consistently strong earnings coming in at $760 million this quarter. Our efforts to grow margins through feed optimization and revenue management were evident this quarter and largely made possible by the differentiated performance of our high-value products. We had a strong contribution from the finished lubricants business, which is celebrating the 50-year anniversary of Mobil 1, our flagship brand.\n Our rigorous focus on structural cost reductions partially offset higher base expenses. The improved earnings power in our businesses translates to strong cash flow and our consistent capital allocation philosophy enables exceptional long-term shareholder returns. We generated $14.7 billion in cash flow from operations and $10.1 billion of free cash flow during the first quarter, and we continue to deploy that capital, consistent with our allocation priorities.\n First and foremost, our CapEx deployment supports investments in competitively advantaged opportunities that drive long-term earnings and cash flow growth. To sustain growth, we need to be investing now in low cost of supply, high-return, resilient projects. We're doing just that with multiple project startups planned for 2025 and that will contribute nearly $4 billion in earnings potential in 2027 at constant prices and margins. Our cash CapEx for the quarter came in at $5.3 billion.\n Secondly, to stay on the offensive through the commodity cycles, we need to maintain a bulletproof balance sheet. During the first quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of bond maturities, bringing our debt-to-capital down to 16% and our net debt-to-capital ratio down to 3%. This outstanding balance sheet strength gives us ample optionality to capitalize on attractive opportunities regardless of where the market moves.\n And finally, strong operational results coupled with a healthy balance sheet, not only provide flexibility to invest through the cycles, but also to consistently return excess cash to our shareholders. We distributed $6.8 billion in the first quarter, including $3.8 billion in dividends. And while we briefly paused share repurchases following the Pioneer S-4 filing in January, we resumed in February and are on track to complete our $17.5 billion stand-alone share repurchase program this year. As a reminder, we intend to increase the pace of the program to $20 billion per year after the Pioneer transaction closes, assuming reasonable market conditions. These distributions matter. They help to drive our industry-leading total shareholder return and over a longer period of time, significantly reduce our share count.\n Since we began the program in 2022, we reduced our share count by about 7% and or 8% excluding the shares issued for the Denbury acquisition. Looking ahead, our team's execution excellence, our stellar balance sheet and our extended reach to new high-value, high-growth markets uniquely positions us to grow long-term value.\n Turning to the second quarter outlook items.

This guidance excludes Pioneer, which we still anticipate will close in the second quarter.\n In Product Solutions, we expect lower scheduled maintenance as we exit the peak of the 2024 turnaround season. We expect corporate and financing expenses to total $300 million to $500 million, in line with the first quarter. We also anticipate an unfavorable working capital impact of about $3 billion from seasonal cash tax payments, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of last year.\n With that, let me go ahead and turn it back to Darren."

            "name": "Darren Woods",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our strategy and the way our people are executing created significant value in the first quarter. We delivered $8.2 billion of earnings and $14.7 billion of cash flow. Even more important, we continue to strengthen the underlying earnings power of the company, which both Kathy and I will discuss in more detail on today's call.\n An important driver of this improved earnings power is our ongoing focus on structural cost savings, which reached $10.1 billion in the quarter versus 2019, furthering our progress towards our goal of $15 billion by 2027. CapEx in the quarter was $5.8 billion, as we continue to invest in advantaged growth projects that will drive future earnings and cash flow. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet, bringing our net debt-to-capital down to 3%, the lowest in more than a decade.\n To reward our shareholders, we distributed $6.8 billion in cash, including $3.8 billion in dividends. For all of 2023, ExxonMobil was the third largest total dividend payer in the S&P 500. Only Microsoft and Apple paid more. We also repurchased about $3 billion of shares. Buybacks were temporarily paused until the shareholders of Pioneer voted on the combination of our companies, which they approved on February 7. Post close, we expect buybacks to ramp up to a pace of $20 billion a year.\n Our ongoing success this quarter reflects the intense focus we have had for the past 7 years on improving every aspect of our business. We developed a strategy tied more directly to our core competitive advantages. We reorganized the company to create a group of centralized organizations that fully utilize the significant synergies between our businesses. We set and met ambitious plans to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company. And we established a track record of excellence in execution that is second to none.\n All of this has been critical to laying the foundation for further success, both in the current plan period through 2027 and over a much longer growth horizon, which I will discuss in a few minutes. As covered in the corporate plan update in early December, we expect to generate an additional $12 billion in earnings potential from 2023 to 2027 on a constant price and margin basis. That represents a compounded annual earnings growth rate over the plan period of greater than 10%. The drivers of this additional value are clear. Higher volumes from advantaged assets, mix improvements from the shift to higher-value products and further structural cost reductions.\n Within Product Solutions, for example, we expect to start up multiple strategic projects between now and the end of 2025, which will drive significant earnings growth through mix improvements. Consider our Singapore Resid Upgrade Project where our industry first technology application will allow us to transform bottom-of-the-barrel molecules into higher value base stocks significantly lifting margins. Our focus on shareholder value extends beyond the work we're doing to drive profitable growth.\n We're also working hard to ensure that the value we've created is not diminished through third-party actions. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few that occurred in the quarter that attracted some media attention. In Guyana, as the operator of the world's premier deepwater development, we have created tremendous value. We believe the proposed Chevron-Hess transaction and ignoring preemption rights triggered by a change of control, diminishes an element of value due ExxonMobil.\n We believe it's critical to defend these rights and fully preserve the value we've created. The arbitration we filed in the quarter seeks to confirm our rights and establish the value of the transaction places on the Guyana asset. This will allow us to fully evaluate options to maximize the value to ExxonMobil and our shareholders. Any responsible management team would do the same.\n In the quarter, we also initiated litigation against 2 special interest activists masquerading as investors. These activists borrowed or group funded a nominal amount of shares to resubmit a proposal that in previous years had little shareholder support, which is a violation of the SEC's rules. These activists have publicly admitted they are working to stop production of oil and natural gas and have no interest in earning a financial return.\n They hijack an important process that gives small shareholders a voice and are undermining the integrity of the system with an agenda that is not in the best interest of our investors or society, which is why we are actively opposing their efforts. Finally, although it attracted less attention, we successfully defended the Pioneer merger against a frivolous lawsuit designed to extract value from ExxonMobil shareholders.\n A plaintiff's lawyer who sued to block the deal has repeatedly abused a legitimate legal process to extort money from companies to have his lawsuit withdrawn. We refused to pay this \"merger tax\". The court ruled in our favor, finding that filing a lawsuit solely to gain leverage in the settlement negotiation is an improper purpose. Even more important, the court sanctioned the lawyer for operating in bad faith in order him to pay ExxonMobil's legal fees, which will hopefully discourage similar frivolous lawsuits in the future. While results of these efforts may not show up in any discrete quarterly result, they underpin long-term value and demonstrate our strong commitment to doing what's right.\n Turning to another area of strong commitment that shows up every quarter, is our focus on functional excellence, a core competitive advantage and a key pillar of our strategy. In Guyana, it's delivering unprecedented success and value creation, reflected in the startup of the Prosperity FPSO last November, ahead of schedule and below cost. As with our 2 previous developments, this cost and schedule performance was industry-leading. The excellence in execution demonstrated in delivering a project continued into its operation.\n With Prosperity, we reached nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels a day in January, just 2 months after startup and well ahead of the industry average of 15 months. Once our projects are up and running, we continually look for debottlenecking opportunities to increase production. All 3 FPSOs are now producing above their funding basis, helping to drive record gross production in the first quarter, all with an emissions intensity amongst the lowest in our upstream portfolio.\n Looking ahead, we're pleased that our sixth project, Whiptail, has now reached FID with a planned start-up by year-end 2027. It's remarkable to think that within 8 years of first oil, Guyana will have a production capacity of more than 1.3 million barrels per day. Our work in Guyana is delivering tangible benefits for the Guyanese people. The development of Guyana's energy economy drove the highest real GDP growth in the world in 2022. The oil and gas industry is directly supporting thousands of local suppliers and Guyanese workers.\n And our gas-to-energy project will feed a new government-owned power plant with the potential to significantly increase reliability and reduce both the cost of electricity and its greenhouse gas emissions. As I said at CERAWeek last month, I believe Guyana will go down as one of the most successful deep water developments in the history of the industry.\n The final point I'd like to make about our upstream business this morning involves our Canada operations. With the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion scheduled to come online May 1, our production from Kearl will have better access to markets in Asia and the U.S. West Coast, which we expect will improve margins and drive higher earnings in future quarters. \n Product Solutions also demonstrated excellence in execution this quarter. Overall, we generated record first quarter refining throughput during a period of peak turnaround activity. Thanks to the outstanding work of our team, we maintained strong turnaround cost and schedule performance. The structural improvements made in turnarounds would not have been possible with our decision to create centralized organizations that are now critical elements of our success. We've been able to take our best thinking and experience from across the corporation and apply it to some of our biggest challenges like these very large maintenance events.\n We've eliminated silos, consolidated expertise and narrowed our focus to the challenges and opportunities with the highest value. Our turnaround performance is translating to both structural cost savings and higher throughput, helping us capture more value from the market than peers, especially at a time of historically high refining margins.\n Finally, our commitment to execution excellence is delivering significant improvements in our environmental performance. Our methane emissions intensity is down more than 60% since 2016. One of the many steps we took included replacing all 6,000-plus natural gas-driven pneumatic devices in our Permian unconventional operated assets. Disciplined execution is critical to success when markets are weak and margins are low. It pays even bigger dividends when the market environment is constructive as it was in the first quarter for crude and refining.\n Crude prices remained roughly flat near the middle of the 10-year range. More recently, the market for crude has tightened with ongoing concerns about the Middle East, putting a floor into prices, which are up more than 10% year-to-date. Natural gas prices move back inside the 10-year range on high inventory and lower demand. Refining margins rose back to the top of the 10-year range as demand grew while industry downtime and global disruptions weighed on supply. Chemical margins were relatively flat as demand growth is being met with new capacity.\n While short-term market conditions are an important context for quarterly results, it's how we position ourselves to leverage the long-term fundamentals that drive sustained shareholder value. I'd like to turn to this for a moment now and plan to spend more time over the year reminding everyone of our attractive growth opportunities that extend well beyond this year and our planned period.\n I know there's a view that we're in a declining industry. That view is wrong. People don't fully appreciate the scale of the global energy system. It took many tens of trillions of dollars to build and today takes more than $2 trillion a year to sustain. This doesn't mean we shouldn't address the emissions challenge. In fact, the world needs to do more in a far more serious way to meet society's emission reduction ambitions. But it also means that oil and natural gas will play a much greater role than the market thinks.\n By 2050, the world is expected to add nearly 2 billion people and the size of the global economy is expected to double from roughly $90 trillion to $180 trillion. Scenarios like IEA Net Zero to see oil demand falling from more than 100 million barrels per day now to 25 million barrels per day in 2050, are not realistic. Even if demand for transportation fuels declined significantly with greater penetration of electric vehicles, the market for petrochemicals is expected to double.\n While the transition to a lower emissions future will be long, there's no denying, it's happening. The question is, who will capture the value. We believe the same competitive advantages that have underpinned ExxonMobil's success for more than 100 years, will serve as the foundation for building a range of world-class businesses in a lower emissions world.\n As I've said many times, we're a technology company at our core. We transform molecules at scale to meet society's needs. The notion that the world can electrify everything is misguided. Molecules will play a dominant role in the energy, materials and products the world needs in 2050 and beyond. At our low carbon solutions spotlight last year, we'll walk you through the opportunity we saw in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Since that time, we've also entered the market for lithium. The total addressable market in these areas going forward is potentially in the trillions of dollars.\n Today, I'd like to mention some of the additional areas we're exploring that have tremendous potential. We discussed each of these opportunities in detail with our Board of Directors during a visit to our Baytown complex in March. The world has become increasingly focused on the challenge of mismanaged plastic waste. The solution requires a sound policy, responsible manufacturing, expanded waste management infrastructure and new technologies like those that underpin our advanced recycling projects.\n We have 12 projects in our plants to help us meet the growing demand for processing plastic waste. Our first project at Baytown is one of the largest in North America, with the ability to process 80 million pounds per year of plastic waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill. By breaking down plastic waste into its constituent molecules, our technology significantly widens the range of plastics that can be processed, including hard recycled materials such as potato chip bags and astro turf. We are planning to develop more than 1 billion pounds per year of plastic waste processing capacity by 2027.\n Another growth area is Proxima, which was showcased at our Product Solutions spotlight last September. With Proxima, we transform lower-value gasoline molecules into a high-performance, high-value resin with numerous commercial applications. In short, Proxima is a new chemistry for an enduring challenge, making materials that are lighter, stronger and more durable with lower GHD emissions.\n Proxima is up to 4x stronger than steel and 7x lighter, making an excellent replacement for rebar. As a protective coating, it takes one application in 5 minutes to cure versus 2 to 3 applications with 8 hours in between. It has multiple light weighting applications in the automotive sector, and it has half the life cycle emissions of traditional thermoset resin systems. For us, Proxima is an advantaged fuels to Performance Chemicals business that we plan to scale and build into a global brand.\n We see an addressable market of up to 5 million tonnes per year, growing faster than GDP, with earnings potential of $1 billion a year by 2040 and returns above 15%.\n We are also exploring opportunities materials made from carbon which, as the world decarbonizes, will become an increasingly advantaged feedstock. We launched a technology venture about 2 years ago to assess attractive new markets for carbon products. We see opportunities to transform the molecular structure of low-value carbon-rich feeds from refining and petrochemical processes to create high-value products for growing markets. Some of these markets include carbon fiber, polymer additives, battery materials and electrodes for steel production. We are specifically focused on high-value segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates more than double GDP.\n One potential opportunity is the carbon materials used in batteries and energy storage solutions. With demand for this segment growing above 10% per year, these carbon materials are expected to be in short supply. Additionally, as the needs for storage solutions evolve, there will be an increasing demand for higher-performance carbon materials. The carbon-rich feedstock available in ExxonMobil's existing businesses coupled with our core technology capabilities and complementary lithium offering positions us to meet the growing demand and deliver product performance improvements required for the battery and energy storage solutions of the future.\n The last technology I'll touch on today is Direct Air Capture or DAC. For the world to reach Net Zero, negative emissions technologies are going to be needed, none holds greater long-term promise than DAC. The challenges, however, are as big as the opportunity. Atmospheric CO2 is extremely diluted at about 425 parts per million, a massive amount of air has to be processed to remove a single ton of carbon dioxide.\n Today, many technologies are competing to crack the code and make DAC scalable and affordable. Our scientists and engineers are hard at work on this problem. We've launched a pilot project at Baytown that has demonstrated feasibility with the use of a proprietary capture process. Our initial goal is to cut the cost in half, which will still be too expensive, but will help move us down the cost curve. The current market for DAC is tiny, at less than 10,000 tons per year of CO2 captured, but the long-term potential is huge.\n We are excited that dozens of companies and universities are chasing direct air capture solutions. We wish them all success irrespective of where the breakthrough occurs or who achieves it. ExxonMobil will have an important role to play.\n As we've demonstrated, there are a few, if any, companies better positioned than us to globally deploy a molecule technology at scale with attractive returns. People who limit our future to the products and markets we are in today, have lost sight of our past and don't understand our core capabilities or advantages or the future potential they hold.\n Consider our Baytown low carbon hydrogen project, which is entering advanced stages of engineering and development. We are not only focused on building the supply side of this new market for low carbon hydrogen, but are also making strong progress in building large-scale demand as demonstrated in our MOUs for offtake of low-carbon ammonia with SK of South Korea and JERA of Japan.\n The last piece required to bring this project in market to life is government policy that maintains a level playing field across all methods of hydrogen production. Without this, we cannot and will not move forward. On the other hand, if incentives are developed to establish a viable technology neutral market, our advantages will allow us to generate attractive returns and invest more, accelerating customers' emissions reduction.\n Over ExxonMobil's entire history and across the globe, we've built industries and value chains where none previously existed. We will continue to do this. In a fast transition, we'll grow earnings and cash flow with accelerated investments in CCS, hydrogen, biofuels and DAC. In a slow transition, we'll grow earnings and cash flow through advantaged investments in our traditional businesses. In irrespective of the transition pace, we'll extend our reach to new high-value markets with innovative new products. Under any scenario, we are convinced that our company is uniquely positioned to play a leading role, meeting the world's essential needs for energy and high-value materials and products.\n With that, I'll hand it over to Kathy. Thanks, Kathy. I'll leave you with a few key takeaways. Our work to improve the fundamental earnings power of ExxonMobil is continuing a pace. By executing with excellence on our strategy, we expect to grow our earnings potential by an additional $12 billion from 2023 to 2027 at constant prices and margins, a growth rate of more than 10% per year. A significant driver of this earnings growth will be our delivery of additional structural cost savings totaling $15 billion by 2027.\n In the quarter, we continue to deliver unprecedented success in Guyana, with growing production creating additional value for our shareholders and the Guyanese people. Our strategic projects, which are another important driver of our planned earnings improvement, helped deliver record first quarter refining throughput and strong Performance Chemicals volume growth. And there are more projects planned for start-up in 2025. All of this is without the contribution of Pioneer.\n With Pioneer, we'll be positioned to drive earnings, cash flow and shareholder distributions even higher. We continue to work constructively with the FTC as they conduct a very thorough review and remain confident that no competition issues should hinder the transaction. We've been working diligently on our integration plans, and we're ready to begin executing day 1 on the significant synergies this combination will create.\n Looking beyond our plan period and into the future, we see attractive large-scale opportunities to leverage our core capabilities in our existing businesses and in brand-new markets with brand-new products, something our competitors can't do.\n The success of this company and our unique set of competitive advantages is built on our greatest strength and most important advantage, great people. They are the best team in the business. Able to successfully overcome any challenge. Through their work at ExxonMobil, they are making a positive difference in the world, meeting people's essential needs for energy and products today and far into the future. I'm extremely proud to represent them and cannot thank them enough."
