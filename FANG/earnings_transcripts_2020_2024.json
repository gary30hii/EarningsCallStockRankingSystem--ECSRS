At this time, all participant lines are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Adam Lawlis. Sir, please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Lateef. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. During our call today, we'll reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam. And welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. Diamondback continue to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's strategy to move activity to our most productive areas in the second quarter of 2020 is now starting to pay dividends in terms of capital efficiency and early time well performance. Well costs and cash operating costs remain near all-time lows, and our average completed lateral length in the fourth quarter was over 13,000 lateral feet, a company record. These operational achievements will translate directly into increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months. We are still operating in a market supported by supply that's being purposefully withheld to allow global inventories to decline as demand recovers from the depths of the global pandemic. Diamondback continues to see no need to grow oil production into this artificially undersupplied market and instead, plans to hold fourth quarter 2020 production flat, while generating free cash flow used to pay our dividend and pay down debt. The Board's decision to increase our dividend by 7% exhibits its confidence in the forward development plan released today, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged, hold production flat in the most capital-efficient manner, with free cash flow used for our dividend and to pay down debt. Growing our dividend and paying down debt are not mutually exclusive, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used for debt pay down in 2021. The fourth quarter of 2020 built on the momentum started in the third quarter with free cash flow increasing to over $242 million, up 58% from the $153 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter last year. We expect this trend to continue in 2021, where we currently expect to generate nearly $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 oil pro forma for the closing of our acquisition of Guidon this Friday. This free cash flow implies a reinvestment ratio below 60% at $50 oil and the mid-point of our $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion capital budget for this year. Note that our CapEx guidance includes the addition of approximately $100 million of capital for the Guidon acquisition, which encompasses one net operated rig added, as well as associated infrastructure and environmental spend. Our production guidance that ties to this capital budget for 2021 assumes that we hold Diamondback's expected fourth quarter oil production of 170 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day flat, plus 10-months of the 12,000 barrels of oil per day that Guidon was producing at time of acquisition announcement. This production guidance also accounts for the estimated impact of the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin last week, which we estimate to have knocked out the equivalent of 100% of our production for four to five days. Production has nearly returned to pre-storm levels as of today, and we expect to make up a majority of the lost production throughout the year, but will not be able to make it all up in the first quarter. The stockholder meeting to vote on our pending merger with QEP Resources is scheduled for March 16th. The merger is expected to close shortly thereafter, subject to QEP stockholder approval. Should the deal approve, we will update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable after closing. While this creates a noisy first quarter in terms of production additions, it will also create a clean look at the pro forma business in the second quarter and beyond. We have only one material term debt maturity due in the next four years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note when it is callable at par later this year. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due 2025 that's currently callable, providing optionality for further gross debt reduction as free cash flow materializes. Turning to ESG. Diamondback today announced a major initiative relating to ESG performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emissions intensity reduction targets, as well as a commitment to point forward Scope 1 carbon neutrality or Net Zero Now. We are committing to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024, and we are committing to reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% from 2019 levels, also by 2024. A detailed breakdown of our Scope 1 and methane emissions from 2019 can be seen on pages 13 and 14 of our latest investor presentation. Diamondback expects to continue to reduce flaring, which is now down almost 90% from 2019 levels, directly impacting over 50% of our 2019 Scope 1 emissions. We also expect to spend approximately $15 million a year over the next four years to retrofit about 600 of our tank batteries with air-powered pneumatic control systems, replacing methane-emitting gas-operated pneumatic control systems. These two changes will be significant drivers in reducing our carbon footprint, but other initiatives like methane leak detection and full field electrification will also have a direct impact on our emissions reduction strategy. Diamondback today also announced the Net Zero Now initiative, which means that as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to be produced with zero net Scope 1 emissions. The GHG and methane intensity reduction targets mentioned earlier are the primary focus, as it relates to our environmental responsibility. But we recognize we will still have a carbon footprint. Therefore, carbon offset credits will be purchased to offset our remaining emissions. Eventually, we expect Diamondback or one of our subsidiaries to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset our remaining Scope 1 emissions, but the credits are a bridge to that time and place. With these major announcements, Diamondback has chosen to adopt a strategy to operate with the highest level of environmental responsibility. Our social and environmental license to operate as a public oil and gas company based in the United States is going to be influenced by our capital providers, and we do not expect our investor pressure for oil and gas companies to improve their environmental performance to subside anytime soon. It is incumbent on us to improve our environmental performance and compete for capital in an industry with ever increasing external pressures. Carbon emissions are a cost, and Diamondback is working to become the low-carbon operator, in addition to our leadership position, as the operator with the lowest capital and operating cost. I am very excited about Diamondback's current position and the strength of our forward outlook, as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase announced yesterday. We are forecasting significant consistent free cash flow generation, translating into returns to shareholders. We look forward to successfully closing and integrating the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, and we'll update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, Travis and team. Travis, I wanted to pick your brain a little a bit about the long-term kind of profile at Diamondback. On a pro forma basis, in our model, which includes QEP, we calculate about $1.4 billion of after dividend free cash flow over the next five years. And I think your dividend is about $300 million, so call it $1.4 million after the dividend or $7 billion. You guys talked about today paying off a little less than $200 million of debt due later this year, plus funding the $375 million of cash from the Guidon acquisition. And then also it sounds like leaning into the dividend on a go-forward basis is something you plan on. But I guess, our broader question is, what are your plans on a longer-term basis in terms of deploying this excess cash?\nTravis Stice: Well, certainly, Arun. That's a good problem to have, right? And I think our cost structure really magnifies our ability to generate that free cash flow. First, the operating metrics of the company continue to just look outstanding. So I'm really excited about that, and we've evidenced it now, for a couple of quarters. But at the board level, we consistently talk about leaning into the base dividend and continuing to enhance our shareholder as a form - as a way of enhancing our shareholder return program. And it's really, like I said, a problem of blessings to have that kind of free cash flow. We want to continue to work the debt quantum down, which we intend to do so. And we'll do like we've always done, and be creative in returning that money back to our shareholders. I've been very demonstrative in our stance of not trying to grow production. So any fears that we're going to take money and start drilling more wells with it this year is just off the table. So it's a good problem to have.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. Arun, on the debt side, I think, in general, anything that has a maturity prior to 2029 is on the table for debt pay down. And I think, we're looking to set the business up to have kind of one turn of permanent leverage with a long-term maturity over 10 years at $50 oil. So in the front end of the curve, all that debt is eligible for paydown, but also not mutually exclusive from the base dividend continuing to increase here.\nArun Jayaram: Got it, got it. Kaes, maybe my follow-up is for you. One of the questions we got last night was just looking at the Midland Basin, D, C&E got on a lot of foot basis I think you averaged about $520 a foot in the second half. The '21 guide is a little bit above that. So I just wanted to understand, what you're dialing in, in terms of perhaps some inflation. And does the mix - is there a mix effect with the Guidon assets being added there? I assume that this is excluding QEP?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. There's nothing on the mix side, Arun. I think we've said in the past, we're not going to guide to all-time low well costs. I think right now, we're in the $500 to $520 a foot range, and we're trying to hold on to that as long as we can. We know that the service industry has suffered through this downturn as much as anybody if not more. And there are some - some pricing pressures at the margin. I wouldn't say, it's on the big ticket items, but you are starting to see some pressure on casing prices and smaller field service items. So like we talked about, the mid-point of our guide is 8% to 10% above where well costs are today. I would hope, the good guys can keep some of that on our side and outperform as we go through the year. But just being conservative on today is February 23rd and we've got 10 more months left of hopefully, $55 plus oil, and that will result in some service cost pressures.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeil Dingmann: Kaes and Travis, my question is, I know - I'm trying to think how long - it hasn't been too terribly long ago that you all restructured, I know, your gathering and processing. You took, I think, at your expense on that. Could you talk a bit about now, the benefits of that from a - just not only from a pricing, but from - I know some folks earlier around the storm and all were having trouble how people take their gas. Could you just talk about both those aspects? And now sort of after converting those contracts from a percent of proceeds to a fixed fee, kind of what - if there's anything more that's needed to be done and the benefits there?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. Neal, I mean, we had a pretty high flaring number in 2019, and it was pretty frustrating to us that, that number was as high as it was. Unfortunately, it was that high because we had a gas processor who had a percent of proceeds contract that was losing money on that contract, and therefore, it wasn't very fair on how much they sent us to flare versus some of their other contracts. So, we took that price risk and decided to restructure that contract into a fixed fee deal. And you can see in the flaring numbers, our numbers have come down dramatically, mostly because of that particular contract moving to fixed fee. Now, with NGLs and gas rallying, that fixed fee stays the same, and we get the benefit as the operator. So that's helping a lot. I don't think it had a lot of impact on - from a storm perspective. I think our field organization during the storm actually stepped up to get power - or get natural gas flowing back to local power plants in the Permian, which eased the problem and stopped the rolling blackouts in the Permian almost immediately. So two separate items, but certainly proud of the field organization for what they did for the cities of Midland and Odessa.\nNeil Dingmann: Yeah. Nice changes there. And then, Travis, just my follow-up, just on the efficiencies you've seen, could you talk - maybe give us an idea, I think, let's call it, post-QEP. I know you've talked about maybe going to eight, nine rigs. I'm just trying to get an idea of both on the D&C side, how many - like kind of what you're up to now as wells per year? For a while, what was it, six to seven rigs, and you were talking about completing, I don't know, nearly 200 - up to 200? Could you give us idea of kind of where your optimal efficiencies are? And is there - I mean, it really is just at sort of what I call crazy levels versus where we were a couple of years ago. I'm just wondering can that get any better?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. I mean, I think, Neil, the rigs, the efficiencies continue to creep up, but we're going to run, I think, nine rigs essentially average for the year to drill 190 wells with 75% of that in the Midland Basin, all over 10,000 feet. But really, the efficiency that's improved is on the frac side. I mean, I think our completion cadence, we're expecting to complete 220 or 225 wells, all over 10,000 feet with three Simul-Frac crews and one spot crew. So, really, the efficiency on both sides is pretty dramatic. And you can see that also in the lateral length, right? I mean we completed over 13,000 average lateral feet in Q4. And we're looking for opportunities throughout our entire asset base to push lateral length to that 12,500 or 15,000 foot range.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. Neil, I'll just add to that, that this time last year, just prior to this time, we were running over 20 drilling rigs. And today, we're running seven or eight, and when you go from that many rigs to that few of rigs, you have the opportunity to high grade your rigs. And then secondarily, when activity really troughed in the second quarter of last year, rather than just sitting on our hands and bemoaning the outlook, our organization really leaned in to try to improve efficiencies. It was a great opportunity with less field activity going on to really examine all of the processes, both on the drilling and completion side and on the production side as well. And so we took advantage of that trough in activity. And as the industry picked back up and as our activity picked back up, we were able to kind of make permanent some of those efficiencies that we revealed through the second quarter and early third quarter. So really proud of that, and I think we're going to see the direct benefits of that in 2021, and that's going to translate to more cash flow for our shareholders.\nNeil Dingmann: Thanks for the details, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson of Stephens. Your question please?\nGail Nicholson: Good morning. The Net Zero Now strategy is great. Can you talk about the expectations on the cost of purchasing carbon offsets? And is that something that will be done at year end? And is that cost in the infrastructure and environmental CapEx line item?\nKaes Van't Hof: Gail, I'll start with the added CapEx. The big piece and the big goals here on the GHG sides are the emissions reductions, right? I think the Net Zero Now initiative is a great addition to the story, but it's not the primary focus. And the primary focus happens to be working down all the numbers you see on slide 13 and 14. And so the big dollars we're going to spend, we're going to spend about $15 million a year converting legacy gas pneumatic, tank batteries to air, and those batteries run off methane essentially and converting that to air, dramatically reduces your methane intensity automatically. So, I'd expect to see $15 million a year in the budget for that, and we've also built that in on the Guidon in QEP acreage as we get a hold of that and look to convert that. The carbon credits, we've already - are in process on a contract for some carbon credits. I won't give all the details, but I'll say it's a mid seven figure number, not an eight figure number. And the projects that we're investing in are tied directly to carbon capture or carbon sequestration rather than the tree planting side of the business.\nTravis Stice: Gail, we're not trying to buy our way into carbon neutrality. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the purchasing of these carbon credits are really just a bridge until we get our operations enhanced and maybe look at some other future investments down the road. But we're really trying to invest in the future. And you know how tight Diamondback runs our CapEx. And spending money on tax credits actually provides us a great incentive to not use those by doing the right things out in the field, like Kaes was mentioning, and articulating to effectuate these changes. And it's a nice bridge in the interim, but that's not the focus of what this initiative is about.\nGail Nicholson: Great. And then there is been some discussion lately regarding the benefits of hedges. Can you talk about the hedging strategy on a go-forward basis? And Kaes, specifically, in your view, how important is hedging to be able to deliver a consistent free cash generation profile?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. I think it's really important, Gail. And I think in the depth of April and May of last year, I told Travis that do not get mad at me if we lost money on some hedges in 2021. And now we're at that point and the commodities rallied, and I think we're sleeping a lot better at night, knowing that the commodities rallied. So I think, overall, if you look at our hedge book, we've tried to keep very wide two-way collars. We're at the bottom end of our collars we're protecting our dividend and protecting - paying down some near-term maturities, but also trying not to limit all the upside to our shareholders. So I think you'll see us keep building that hedge book with wide collars. I think the percent hedge that we have is inverted just like the forward curve, and I think we're going to be patient adding hedges. But overall, I still think hedging is an important philosophy for an oil and gas company to guarantee returns and guarantee returns to shareholders in the form of true cash distributions.\nTravis Stice: Gail, I just want to return to your question that you asked earlier and reemphasize the point that we feel like we have a social and environmental license to operate. And I'll tell you, for the last multiple quarters, we've been really digging into this. But one of the things that surprised me was relatively, it's still a lot of money, but relatively how little cost is required to do the right thing here with regards particularly to methane emission and converting these tank batteries. And I think as other companies' kind of dig into that, I hope they find the same outcome that it is real dollars and it is real shareholder funds that we're diverting away from the drill bit, but it's not as bad as maybe what we were originally thinking. And again, I just go back to our environmental and social license and trying to do the right thing here.\nGail Nicholson: No, I agree. It's basically a two to three well diversion every year to get this pneumatic gas on your batteries installed, which makes a huge difference. So I congratulate you guys are making that effort and more companies should do that.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Gail. And yeah, it does sting a little bit, but I think it's the right thing to do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Your line is open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good morning, Travis, Kaes and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good morning. Just wanted to ask around lateral lengths, as you integrate Gideon and hopefully QEP here, you saw a tick-up on this larger pad in the fourth quarter where you were averaging 13,000 feet per well. You budgeted next year at 10,000, I guess, for FANG and Guidon. Should we expect that number to tick up in '21 and '22? I would imagine as you're integrating two assets, the availability of swaps kind of opens itself up there? Can you talk about where that lateral length progression is moving? And is this something that we should be thinking about the over for - on that 10,000 per well over the next couple of years?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. David, good question. I mean, I think the beauty of the Guidon and QEP assets as they sit relative to our position is that you have - they all fit hand and glove. And so that gives us an opportunity to push lateral lengths for one of our - what will be our biggest operating area for the next few years. So I'd put 10,000 as the floor. We still have rigs running outside of that main block. But if we're having - and we're going to have half of our rigs running in the big block in Martin County, I'd expect those five rigs probably average a little higher than 10,000, whereas the rest of the position might be a little below it. So could we get it up to - up 10%? I think that's possible. But again, the teams are doing their work. And the contiguous nature of that block is going to promote a lot of capital efficiency.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate that. And my second question is just, you talked, Travis, about the macro environment and kind of eschewing [ph] growth in favor of returning on - capital to shareholders over time. It seems like with this fixed dividend increase, you guys are signaling that this is sort of a sustainable level at a $40 price and below, maybe mid 30s to 40. Considering now that we're in almost a $55 to $60 environment, does anything change operationally? You guys responded to a low price environment by coring up your activity. I know that you're not interested in growth at this point. But do you change the design at all at the field level and perhaps not core as much as you have been?\nTravis Stice: No, David, it's - we can't pay attention to weekly changes in commodity price. We have to try to do the best thing, the right thing from a reservoir performance all the time. And we're not getting enamored or stars in our eyes with higher commodity price.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. No one ever blamed you for drilling wells that are too good, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: That's true. Good luck, guys. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Your question, please.\nScott Hanold: Yeah. Thanks. And maybe another follow-up on that, the last line of questioning. Obviously, it's - commend you guys for sticking to the plan, with maintenance this year. But there's a lot of potential for an oil super-cycle and if that does occur, like, how do you see Diamondback in a - like a 2022 plus outlook. And is there going to be a limit to the amount of growth you could push. I would assume that there's going to be some moderate growth that you'd see acceptable, given the amount of free cash flow that's out there. If you could just give us some color on. Is it a reinvestment rate you'd target? Is it a growth rate or free cash flow yield? How do you look at a much stronger for longer oil price cycle?\nKaes Van't Hof: Well, Scott, that will be a good problem to have. So, hopefully, we're on our way, but I think we've been pretty clear that we don't want to put a very complicated business into a box, in terms of reinvestment rate, growth rate. I mean, I think what we can say is that, if there was ever growth, called ponge [ph] by US shale, it would not be double digits, it wouldn't be zero. But, yeah, there is oil price where your free cash flow increases more if you grow slightly. And we've done that work. I still think we're a ways away from it, but we've proven that we can grow in the past and I think, a low cost structure benefits you when prices are weak, but it also is a kick-starter to potential growth if prices are strong. So I don't think it's time to talk about growth, but if there was growth ever mentioned for us its sub double digits or mid-single digits.\nTravis Stice: Yeah, just, just to re-emphasize the point I made earlier about, we're still in an undersupplied world and, yeah, we can see the tea leaves talking about a supercycle, but that's not where we are today. I think just that - just in the final analysis Scott, growth down and back, we'll have to see a fundamental shift in the macro supply, demand. But future growth is not something we're scared of. Now, as Kaes pointed out, hyper-growth is probably still not a role, but, growth when it drives incremental shareholder returns, it is part of our long-term decision matrix. But, right now, we simply don't need to grow, right, with this much excess storage and steel production capacity out there in the world. But I think trying to put ourselves into a decision, straight-jacket is anticipating an old supercycle is not is not good business for us right now.\nScott Hanold: I appreciate that response. My follow-up is a little bit on current production rates. And if you can help me out a couple things, I guess, first off, you talked about, holding the line on the Diamondback legacy assets are on 172 to 175. Obviously and you kind of said that, fourth quarter levels, obviously you guys outperform that. You'll perform that in January as well. Just giving a little bit of color on, what do you mean by holding 171, 175 slab when you're, prone to the purposes above that rate? And then, if you can give also, some color on, what we should expect with QEP when it starts with you guys? And understanding that the last sort of like data point update was back in the third quarter of 2020?\nTravis Stice: Yeah, Scott. I'm going let Kaes to answer that, but I just, you provided me an opportunity to talk about how pleased we are with our operation performance, operational performance. We saw it in the fourth quarter. We saw it in January. And had not been historic 100-year storm out in the Permian. February we'd be looking good as well. So, really, really pleased at the way that we're executing right now in our operation performance.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah, Scott. We're looking to key production guidance and CapEx guidance is very simple. I mean, I think, we said we're going to work our way up to 170 to 175, oil by Q4. Luckily, we outperformed that. But that was going to be the baseline for our plan in 2021 all along. And if we outperform that plan then that's, some for the good guys. So, overall, nothing has changed in terms of our anticipation of keeping guide on plus QEP, plus Diamondback flat through 2021. And in this guidance, we put out, we're basically giving you FANG at 170 to 175, plus 10 months of Guidon out of 12,000 barrels a day. And a little storm impact which we expect to make up throughout the year.\nScott Hanold: Okay. And what should we expect with QEP obviously the last update was I think at the third quarter average. What is the expected - like you have a sense of what that looks like when it starts up in March, with you guys?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah, yeah, I can't, give you that today. I mean QEP is going to report there tomorrow and we'll see what that report says. And we will surely update the market as quickly as we can. But I can't give guidance on a deal that shareholders need to vote on.\nScott Hanold: Understood. Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your question please?\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning.\nTravis Stice: Hey, Scott.\nScott Gruber: Saw the dividend increase here. One of your peers is dimensioning their comfort level with the base dividend as about 10% of operating cash flow at their normal crude price. Can you provide some color on how you think about, the appropriateness of the base dividend for Diamondback?\nKaes Van't Hof: I mean, I think that will be a good goal to work to. I mean, ours is a little lower than that in a $50 world and certainly lower than that at strip today. I kind of see it as more what's our consistent dividend growth rate over a longer period of time. And what are we doing to decrease the size of the enterprise value with free cash flow. I think right now, this dividend increase came a little early, but we also leaned into the dividend in 2020 during some pretty dark times. So I think investors have universally asked us to hold the dividend and continue to grow it consistently. And while 7% is our lowest growth rate of the past couple of years, I don't think it's off the table that we can revisit this - the dividend multiple times a year now at this point where we are.\nScott Gruber: Got you. And then, just thinking about the budget split across the Midland and Delaware, 75% to the Midland this year. Can you just speak to the medium-term split, thinking over the next kind of two to four years, are you going to stay in that ballpark of around 75% to the Midland, post the acquisitions? And how should we think about, if we are back in an environment where you're starting to grow some, call it, mid single digit, how does that split start to shift, if at all? And does the Delaware provide more of the flex in the budget?\nTravis Stice: I kind of see it more as we're going to have a really large block in Martin County that we can put a lot of rigs to work pretty consistently, so long as we have the infrastructure in place, and we expect to do so. So I think with QEP, pending that deal closing, that 75% Midland number is going to go up, and hopefully, it stays kind of in that 75% to 85% of lateral footage consistently for the next three to five years. I think that's a little lower percentage of total capital, but it's going to be a pretty high percent of our net lateral footage for a long time here.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Whitfield: Hey. Good morning, all. And as many have said before me, thanks for taking a leadership position for the sector with your ESG initiatives.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: With regard to your potential investment in CCS to offset your Scope 1 emissions, would you likely do that in concert with EOR? And if so, have your teams evaluated the application of EOR in any of your interventional project areas?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. Derrick, I mean, that's one of the pillars that we're looking at. I can't commit to anything today. But I think what we've tried to say is that the credits that we purchased here give us a little bit of time to study the market or even partner on projects at either Diamondback or Rattler to build out a more direct offset to our Scope 1 emissions. So that's in the fold. The hot topic of wind and solar, power in Texas is also in the fold. And I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities with companies with large balance sheets that are leading this energy transition that are also oil and gas companies. So I think we're going to play a small part in it and hopefully, find a good partner to develop carbon capture or one of these other renewable sources to offset our Scope 1.\nTravis Stice: But Derrick, I'll also add that while we don't - there's not specific EOR projects underway with 85% or 90% of the oil still left in the ground, even with the most advanced completions technologies, we know that enhanced oil recovery is a part of our industry's future. And there are some guys out there kind of on the leading edge that Diamondback, as our style, we're following very closely to see if they're having success. But it would be nice if those two things were - had the same mutual objectives, carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery and tight horizontally developed shale resources. But as Kaes pointed out, we're just barely getting started on that.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes sense. And with my follow-up, shifting over to the capital side of your outlook, could you offer any color on a clean maintenance capital estimate, assuming the inclusion of QEP and based on your current cost expectations?\nTravis Stice: I mean it's kind of what we gave. I mean QEP has put out some high-level numbers on their full year 2021. So I think it's fair to look at those numbers. Now, if you think about us closing the deal in March, we'll only have cash CapEx for three quarters of that. But at current cost estimates, like I said, I think the mid-point of our guidance is 8% to 10% above where current well costs are. So, if we stay the same, you could chop 8% to 10% off of that and get a solid maintenance number.\nDerrick Whitfield: That's great. Thanks for your time guys.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is just on the M&A and A&D landscape. I know it may be a little too soon to talk about what opportunities both transactions could bring since the QEP deal is more expected to close next month. But are there any comments or thoughts you can share on how the landscape looks to you all in areas where you may be active once everything is rolled in? And then any comments on industry consolidation more broadly from here, especially following an active 2020 would be great as well.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. I'll let Travis talk about the macro. But just in general in A&D, we've been following it pretty closely. I think there's a lot of capital that's been allocated towards PDP type transactions, which bodes well for any potential deal we look to pursue in the Williston - for QEP's Williston assets. It seems like that's the hot A&D market of the year so far. So we're excited about that. Commodity price certainly helps. We have some small stuff that we would look to sell in the Permian that's fully developed that doesn't compete for capital and that market looks pretty good. So we're excited about A&D. I think from a consolidation perspective, a lot of big consolidation happened in 2020, obviously, and you can just see now how much production is in the hands of 10 to 12 companies in the US, and I think that bodes well for capital discipline and industry consolidation, although I think it still needs to continue. Travis?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. What we've seen in the past, Jeff, when we go through one of these cycles of rapid commodity price increases, names that you would have thought would have come off the board - public names that would have come off the board, probably now have a lot greater runway with the higher commodity price. So usually, when you see these kinds of cycles accelerate, it makes, from a macro perspective, A&D harder to do. But just like Kaes was saying, though, we've got Guidon and soon to be QEP to roll in the mix and we're very comfortable with where our inventory sits right now in terms of runway in front of us. So I just want to add that in as well.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Appreciate it. And then my second one was just on hydrocarbon mix as the newly acquired assets are rolled in. Just wanted to get a sense for how you'd expect the higher weighting for Midland activity, which I guess should increase further once QEP is more fully rolled into effect oil and gas mix over the near term?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. It should help a little bit, 100 to 200 bps of oil mix. I think that's why we started guiding to oil separately from BOEs. The BOEs continue to outperform, primarily because flaring is down 5%, which has resulted in a lot higher BOE numbers and BOE reserves. So Midland certainly is oilier and moving to Midland, Northern Midland is going to help. But the production base is pretty large right now, so I think it's in the range of 100 to 200 bps, not more than that.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: All right. Appreciate it.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrian Singer: Thank you. Good morning. Travis, you've been very forceful on the capital discipline side, not using incremental cash flow back to the drill bit, focusing on paying debt and incremental return of capital to shareholders. You do have exposure and - through your partnerships to what others are doing. And I wondered, given some of the rig increases we've seen from private producers, if you have any perspective on what you see others doing and if you expect other operators in the Midland and Delaware basins to reflect the discipline that you're expressing here?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. Brian, I think - I know you're asking those questions to those individual operators. But from a macro perspective, what I'm seeing is that we still are undersupplied on rigs to keep the Permian Basin flat. So you may see some rig adds coming, but right now, it's probably not enough to offset the production declines that we've seen through the lack of investment over the last 12 months. So I believe, and maybe I'm the internal optimist, but I believe if moving through the depths of a global apocalypse that was created by this pandemic, if oil and gas companies haven't got discipline now, they probably never will. So I'm optimistic that the industry is going to tow the line on capital discipline, irrespective of commodity prices. Now there will be some time in the future, a signal when supply has worked off and Iranian barrels are absorbed and surplus OPEC capacities has consumed that the world will be signaling for growth. But as we tried to articulate earlier, the days of hyper growth in the shale industry should be part of our history, not part of our future. But I'll tell you, just adding to that, and I know you guys get tired of hearing me talk about our operations and our low cost. But as the low-cost producer, almost irrespective of commodity price, we're going to drive the highest returns to our shareholders.\nBrian Singer: Great. Thank you. And then I wanted to further follow-up on the carbon net zero objective, and particularly on the sequestration and clean energy comments that you made. When you think about expanding the Diamondback footprint into sequestration or clean energy, do you see these as core competencies the Diamondback team already has, core competencies the team can easily bring in-house? Or should invest along with others to fund existing companies that have that core competency?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. No, Brian, I don't see those core competencies inside Diamondback, and it's unlikely that we would branch out into trying to say that we can become a better solar company or a better wind farm company than pre-existing. I think that's actually a trap that some companies get into as they try to diversify into areas where they're not experts. We at Diamondback know what the main thing is and the main thing is, is for us to produce barrels at the highest cash margin with the lowest cost and now the lowest carbon footprint. So I think the most likely scenario would be that we participate alongside a subject matter expert in whatever that carbon capture technology is.\nBrian Singer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Your question please?\nRichard Tullis: Thanks. Good morning. Travis and Kaes, so just continuing with the net zero initiative discussion. So just listening to everything this morning, so is it fair to say you may be initially more interested in the carbon capture side of CCUS rather than the CO2 transportation and sequestration side?\nKaes Van't Hof: Hey, Richard, it's just too early, right? I think we're getting away from the fact that the goal is get Scope 1 down by 50% as soon as possible and get methane down by 70% as soon as possible on the intensity side. And those remain the focus, right? I think getting into other businesses is a three, five, seven-year discussion. But the discussion today is, what are we going to do to get our carbon footprint down and not just offset it, right? I think eventually, offsetting it with something smart in terms of an investment, a small investment, but it's not going to end up taking 10%, 15%, 20% of our budget. I think, like Travis said, the main thing is the main thing, and that's we're an oil and gas producer that's going to be producing here for a long time. But as a public operator today, the 1pressures to operate in an environmentally responsible manner are only going one way, and we're taking the bull by the horns by getting those intensity numbers down as soon as possible.\nTravis Stice: Yeah. Richard, we're not trying to buy our way into carbon neutrality. We're trying to be very specific. You can see on slides 12, 13 and 14 in our investor deck how much transparency we're using to try to describe exactly what we're going to do. We've been very prescriptive in talking about 600 tank batteries that need to be retrofitted and spending $10 million to $15 million a year over the next three to four years in order to make that happen. So our focus is not to try to buy our way into carbon neutrality. Our focus is how can we invest to eliminate our Scope 1 emissions. And the carbon credits now provide us a bridge, and quite honestly, provides us an incentive because I don't like spending that money, but it provides us an incentive to get the operations in the shape that they need to be. And that's what we need for our shareholders, and that's what our industry needs as well, too. And I hope other companies can take a similar examination of what efforts they're doing to reduce methane emissions, particularly.\nRichard Tullis: Appreciate that. Good discussion. That's actually all I have. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Richard.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. I have to apologize first. I may have joined a little bit late, you may have discussed it already. You raised the regular dividend, and you also mentioned that in the future, once your debt has come down further or that the position is better, you will look for other alternatives ways that to increase the shareholder distribution. So I wanted to see them, what is the precondition for that? Or what kind of debt level or that any kind of criteria you could indicate? And also, can you discuss your preference between the variable dividend and the buyback? Or that the regular dividend increase will be the primary source of the distribution? Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. Paul, that's a good question. I think a variable or buyback are things that are worth discussing when debt levels are at a level that we're very comfortable with, which is probably close to one times leverage at $45 to $50 WTI. So I think once we're closer to that range, we can talk about additional return to capital, which is kind of why, earlier in the call, I mentioned that anything with a maturity prior to 2029 in our debt stack is probably up for grabs to pay down in conjunction with continuing to increase the dividend. But, as soon as we get there, I think it's a worthy topic to say what is the best return to shareholders post or after the base dividend and when debt is very comfortably in that one times range. But first and foremost, we need to get our debt back down to $5.5 billion gross debt pro forma for all the deals that we've just done, and we'll be getting there as quickly as we can and continue to work that down.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nLeo Mariani: Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made earlier. Kaes, I think it was you said in terms of purchasing the carbon offsetting credits, it's going to be some type of mid seven figure number. Just wanted to clarify, is that an annual number, roughly speaking, for you folks? And it sounded like you also talked about this transition time line kind of being three to seven years. So, should we expect that kind of for the next three to seven years? And is that something that would just kind of run through as an operating expense in your financials eventually?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. Well, it's highly dependent upon how many tons of CO2 equivalent we emit, right? I mean in 2019, we emitted 1.4 million tons. I think we'll be well below that in 2020 and on to 2021. So the cost goes down. Now, if I was a betting man, I'd bet that carbon offset credits are going to continue to increase in price. We've secured a few years' worth right now. But I think it will be dependent upon how that market evolves over the coming years. But again, it's not a material expense, and it's not the priority. The priority is getting the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions that we have down so that you pay less of a penalty.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Great. And obviously, you guys are clearly in the midst of closing the QEP and Guidon deals in the near term here. Travis, you briefly addressed M&A earlier. But as you get to your target debt number here in the near future, do you still have a desire at Diamondback to continue to be a consolidator of choice in the Permian?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. Look, Leo, we're very comfortable with where we are right now, particularly with these two deals closing, one Friday and then one in a couple of weeks after that. So, we're very comfortable where we are. And we'll just - like we always do, we monitor the landscapes, and if we think we can deliver outstanding returns to our shareholders, then we'll take a look at it. But in terms of inventory life and all of that, we're very comfortable with where we are.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your question please?\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Travis and Kaes. And to the rest of the team there.\nTravis Stice: Hey, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Kaes, so I think maybe this question might be for you, I appreciate you gave us a really pretty thorough rundown of your debt pay down options and you gave us a good framework. I'm wondering if you could refresh us a bit with your thinking or your options on the QEP debt, in particular, the '22 s and '23s, and how that might play into your - your debt paydown plans?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. It's certainly a chess piece, Charles. I think QEP has three notes outstanding, '22s, '23s and '26s. Those notes probably end up getting tendered for and refinance in some form or fashion, lower interest rate with longer average maturity, but also putting something on the front end of our debt stack to guarantee further debt pay down. So it's really dependent upon how many people tender the bonds, if and when that begins. I think the FANG 2025 notes is also a chess piece that goes into that. And I think we're pretty close to starting that process with the shareholder vote coming up in March 16. So we wanted to take advantage of these rates with three goals. We want to pay down gross debt overall over time at our discretion, we want to lower average interest rate, and we want a longer average term to maturity. And I think we're setting ourselves up to accomplish that.\nCharles Meade: Got it, Kaes. So if I understand you correctly, it's not committing to one path or another, but really just kind of continuing to pushing optimization and finding - picking your spot?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. With the caveat that, we do need to work on some restricted covenants and some reporting requirements on the QEP notes because we don't anticipate reporting as two separate companies for a long time. So I think Pioneer, Conoco, Chevron have all followed different or similar paths in handling the notes of the company they acquired, and we're going to copy one of those.\nCharles Meade: Got it. That makes sense. Thanks a lot for that. And then, Travis, this is perhaps for you. I wondered if you could characterize, the assets that you're picking up in Southeast Martin County or towards the - in the Southeast quadrant, that's - could you characterize how prominently do those factor into your 2021 plans? And to the extent you are going to put some rigs there, when would we expect to see some results from those assets?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. I mean, we're going to add one rig net for the Guidon deal, and that rig is going to drill a 10or 12 well pad here throughout the year. And that pad is going to come on early next year. And then, I think, I can't speak to the QEP development plan. But I think as soon as we can move rigs to that big block in Southeast Martin County, we're going to move two or three rigs there and be active there for the next five, even, eight years.\nCharles Meade: All right. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Charles.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Your question please?\nJeanine Wai: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.\nTravis Stice: Hey, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: You're probably going to kill me. My questions are on the ESG and Net Zero Now initiative, but maybe just two quick ones. We know you've made it clear that you're not looking to buy your way out of emissions or anything like that. And the credits are really just a supplement to your good internal efforts. You mentioned you have some contracts in place at CCS. But in terms of the other options, what are the different markets that you're looking at in order to potentially buy offsets? I mean, we're thinking it's not California. We know Texas has an exchange market. And are you currently eligible to participate in all of the credit markets?\nTravis Stice: Yeah, we are Jeanine. And we're pretty focused on US carbon credits versus international. International, you can get a little cheaper, but I don't think that ties directly to our license to operate in the US. So the couple of projects that we've invested in, two of them are based in Texas, one of them is based in Wyoming, and that's our start. I think we're going to build a good relationship with our partners on this and eventually work to invest directly. But I think overall, with us executing on this initiative, there's going to be a lot of inbound phone calls on opportunities. And I just think our goal is to make sure what we do invest in ties more directly to what we produce rather than other environmental aspects.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Very interesting. And then, maybe just following up on Brian's question earlier. I know you're not looking to be a merchant power player or anything like that. But you're looking at both in-house and third-party opportunities; it sounds like, for the income-generating projects. So not to get ahead of ourselves, but we are. Longer term, could this be maybe carved out as a separate business, if you develop a portfolio? Because it seems like for a lot of these ESG projects, companies' kind of really only get credit or a lot of interest when it turns into like a real business that investors can quantify. And longer term, there's been lots of spin-offs and opportunities for that. So is that something that maybe you would consider?\nKaes Van't Hof: I mean, I think, we're getting way ahead of ourselves, Jeanine, on that. But I think we've proven to be pretty smart when it comes to spin-offs, but I think my head might explode if we thought about another spin-off right now. So we're going to just, first, get our numbers down. Second, invest smartly or wisely with bigger partners, and then third, figure out how to monetize down the line. But certainly, we're very cognizant of the multiples that, that side of the business gets versus an oil and gas company right now, but that's not the reason why we're doing this.\nTravis Stice: Yeah. Janine, we want to make sure we emphasize - keeping the main thing, I said that earlier. And we know what we're really good at, and we know what we're still learning at. And we're going to focus on what we're really good at, and we'll participate alongside someone that's really good at something else. And as Kaes said, for another fourth company or fourth entity, that's not - that doesn't sound very good to me right now. So I think our focus is going to be doing the right thing at Diamondback operations to drive down our emissions intensity.\nJeanine Wai: Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Jeanine.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to CEO, Travis Stice, for closing remarks. Sir?\nTravis Stice: Thank you. Occasionally, I'll use my closing remarks to add a message that's kind of directed towards our organization and a message I think sometimes important for our investors to hear that separates from sort of the standard quarter. This past week, as we're all acutely aware of, the Permian Basin experienced unprecedented weather event. We had over 220 hours of below freezing weather. And really across the Permian Basin, we had extended periods of no electricity and water supplies frozen and really, against all of that, we had a frozen and a dark oilfield. And our field organization, and in some cases, these individuals working over 20 hours a day, they were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants. They weren't working to get Diamondback's volumes flowing and back online earlier because of our quarterly objectives. They were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants that were - honestly, that were sitting idle, particularly on the West side of Odessa. And they were sitting idle because they didn't have any fuel. And through our efforts and other operators' efforts, gas was delivered and Texas had power. This occurred Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning. And by Thursday, most of Texas, again, had power. And it's - I just want to - the efforts that were displayed by many individuals in the Permian Basin transcends normal procedures for returning production in the Permian Basin is grateful for - we're really grateful for everything that you guys did. You answered the call and you put forth a heroic effort that will not be forgotten. Just want to tell you publicly, thank you for everything that you guys did. So with that, thanks for everyone participating in today's call. And if you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Thanks, Lateef.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yeah. Arun, on the debt side, I think, in general, anything that has a maturity prior to 2029 is on the table for debt pay down. And I think, we're looking to set the business up to have kind of one turn of permanent leverage with a long-term maturity over 10 years at $50 oil. So in the front end of the curve, all that debt is eligible for paydown, but also not mutually exclusive from the base dividend continuing to increase here. Yeah. There's nothing on the mix side, Arun. I think we've said in the past, we're not going to guide to all-time low well costs. I think right now, we're in the $500 to $520 a foot range, and we're trying to hold on to that as long as we can. We know that the service industry has suffered through this downturn as much as anybody if not more. And there are some - some pricing pressures at the margin. I wouldn't say, it's on the big ticket items, but you are starting to see some pressure on casing prices and smaller field service items. So like we talked about, the mid-point of our guide is 8% to 10% above where well costs are today. I would hope, the good guys can keep some of that on our side and outperform as we go through the year. But just being conservative on today is February 23rd and we've got 10 more months left of hopefully, $55 plus oil, and that will result in some service cost pressures. Thanks, Arun. Yeah. Neil, I'll just add to that, that this time last year, just prior to this time, we were running over 20 drilling rigs. And today, we're running seven or eight, and when you go from that many rigs to that few of rigs, you have the opportunity to high grade your rigs. And then secondarily, when activity really troughed in the second quarter of last year, rather than just sitting on our hands and bemoaning the outlook, our organization really leaned in to try to improve efficiencies. It was a great opportunity with less field activity going on to really examine all of the processes, both on the drilling and completion side and on the production side as well. And so we took advantage of that trough in activity. And as the industry picked back up and as our activity picked back up, we were able to kind of make permanent some of those efficiencies that we revealed through the second quarter and early third quarter. So really proud of that, and I think we're going to see the direct benefits of that in 2021, and that's going to translate to more cash flow for our shareholders. Thanks, Neil. Gail, I'll start with the added CapEx. The big piece and the big goals here on the GHG sides are the emissions reductions, right? I think the Net Zero Now initiative is a great addition to the story, but it's not the primary focus. And the primary focus happens to be working down all the numbers you see on slide 13 and 14. And so the big dollars we're going to spend, we're going to spend about $15 million a year converting legacy gas pneumatic, tank batteries to air, and those batteries run off methane essentially and converting that to air, dramatically reduces your methane intensity automatically. So, I'd expect to see $15 million a year in the budget for that, and we've also built that in on the Guidon in QEP acreage as we get a hold of that and look to convert that. The carbon credits, we've already - are in process on a contract for some carbon credits. I won't give all the details, but I'll say it's a mid seven figure number, not an eight figure number. And the projects that we're investing in are tied directly to carbon capture or carbon sequestration rather than the tree planting side of the business. Yeah. I think it's really important, Gail. And I think in the depth of April and May of last year, I told Travis that do not get mad at me if we lost money on some hedges in 2021. And now we're at that point and the commodities rallied, and I think we're sleeping a lot better at night, knowing that the commodities rallied. So I think, overall, if you look at our hedge book, we've tried to keep very wide two-way collars. We're at the bottom end of our collars we're protecting our dividend and protecting - paying down some near-term maturities, but also trying not to limit all the upside to our shareholders. So I think you'll see us keep building that hedge book with wide collars. I think the percent hedge that we have is inverted just like the forward curve, and I think we're going to be patient adding hedges. But overall, I still think hedging is an important philosophy for an oil and gas company to guarantee returns and guarantee returns to shareholders in the form of true cash distributions. Yeah. No one ever blamed you for drilling wells that are too good, David. Well, Scott, that will be a good problem to have. So, hopefully, we're on our way, but I think we've been pretty clear that we don't want to put a very complicated business into a box, in terms of reinvestment rate, growth rate. I mean, I think what we can say is that, if there was ever growth, called ponge [ph] by US shale, it would not be double digits, it wouldn't be zero. But, yeah, there is oil price where your free cash flow increases more if you grow slightly. And we've done that work. I still think we're a ways away from it, but we've proven that we can grow in the past and I think, a low cost structure benefits you when prices are weak, but it also is a kick-starter to potential growth if prices are strong. So I don't think it's time to talk about growth, but if there was growth ever mentioned for us its sub double digits or mid-single digits. Yeah, Scott. We're looking to key production guidance and CapEx guidance is very simple. I mean, I think, we said we're going to work our way up to 170 to 175, oil by Q4. Luckily, we outperformed that. But that was going to be the baseline for our plan in 2021 all along. And if we outperform that plan then that's, some for the good guys. So, overall, nothing has changed in terms of our anticipation of keeping guide on plus QEP, plus Diamondback flat through 2021. And in this guidance, we put out, we're basically giving you FANG at 170 to 175, plus 10 months of Guidon out of 12,000 barrels a day. And a little storm impact which we expect to make up throughout the year. Yeah, yeah, I can't, give you that today. I mean QEP is going to report there tomorrow and we'll see what that report says. And we will surely update the market as quickly as we can. But I can't give guidance on a deal that shareholders need to vote on. Thanks, Scott. I mean, I think that will be a good goal to work to. I mean, ours is a little lower than that in a $50 world and certainly lower than that at strip today. I kind of see it as more what's our consistent dividend growth rate over a longer period of time. And what are we doing to decrease the size of the enterprise value with free cash flow. I think right now, this dividend increase came a little early, but we also leaned into the dividend in 2020 during some pretty dark times. So I think investors have universally asked us to hold the dividend and continue to grow it consistently. And while 7% is our lowest growth rate of the past couple of years, I don't think it's off the table that we can revisit this - the dividend multiple times a year now at this point where we are. Yeah. Derrick, I mean, that's one of the pillars that we're looking at. I can't commit to anything today. But I think what we've tried to say is that the credits that we purchased here give us a little bit of time to study the market or even partner on projects at either Diamondback or Rattler to build out a more direct offset to our Scope 1 emissions. So that's in the fold. The hot topic of wind and solar, power in Texas is also in the fold. And I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities with companies with large balance sheets that are leading this energy transition that are also oil and gas companies. So I think we're going to play a small part in it and hopefully, find a good partner to develop carbon capture or one of these other renewable sources to offset our Scope 1. Yeah. I'll let Travis talk about the macro. But just in general in A&D, we've been following it pretty closely. I think there's a lot of capital that's been allocated towards PDP type transactions, which bodes well for any potential deal we look to pursue in the Williston - for QEP's Williston assets. It seems like that's the hot A&D market of the year so far. So we're excited about that. Commodity price certainly helps. We have some small stuff that we would look to sell in the Permian that's fully developed that doesn't compete for capital and that market looks pretty good. So we're excited about A&D. I think from a consolidation perspective, a lot of big consolidation happened in 2020, obviously, and you can just see now how much production is in the hands of 10 to 12 companies in the US, and I think that bodes well for capital discipline and industry consolidation, although I think it still needs to continue. Travis? Hey, Richard, it's just too early, right? I think we're getting away from the fact that the goal is get Scope 1 down by 50% as soon as possible and get methane down by 70% as soon as possible on the intensity side. And those remain the focus, right? I think getting into other businesses is a three, five, seven-year discussion. But the discussion today is, what are we going to do to get our carbon footprint down and not just offset it, right? I think eventually, offsetting it with something smart in terms of an investment, a small investment, but it's not going to end up taking 10%, 15%, 20% of our budget. I think, like Travis said, the main thing is the main thing, and that's we're an oil and gas producer that's going to be producing here for a long time. But as a public operator today, the 1pressures to operate in an environmentally responsible manner are only going one way, and we're taking the bull by the horns by getting those intensity numbers down as soon as possible. Thank you, Richard. Yeah. Paul, that's a good question. I think a variable or buyback are things that are worth discussing when debt levels are at a level that we're very comfortable with, which is probably close to one times leverage at $45 to $50 WTI. So I think once we're closer to that range, we can talk about additional return to capital, which is kind of why, earlier in the call, I mentioned that anything with a maturity prior to 2029 in our debt stack is probably up for grabs to pay down in conjunction with continuing to increase the dividend. But, as soon as we get there, I think it's a worthy topic to say what is the best return to shareholders post or after the base dividend and when debt is very comfortably in that one times range. But first and foremost, we need to get our debt back down to $5.5 billion gross debt pro forma for all the deals that we've just done, and we'll be getting there as quickly as we can and continue to work that down. Thanks, Paul. Yeah. Well, it's highly dependent upon how many tons of CO2 equivalent we emit, right? I mean in 2019, we emitted 1.4 million tons. I think we'll be well below that in 2020 and on to 2021. So the cost goes down. Now, if I was a betting man, I'd bet that carbon offset credits are going to continue to increase in price. We've secured a few years' worth right now. But I think it will be dependent upon how that market evolves over the coming years. But again, it's not a material expense, and it's not the priority. The priority is getting the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions that we have down so that you pay less of a penalty. Yeah. It's certainly a chess piece, Charles. I think QEP has three notes outstanding, '22s, '23s and '26s. Those notes probably end up getting tendered for and refinance in some form or fashion, lower interest rate with longer average maturity, but also putting something on the front end of our debt stack to guarantee further debt pay down. So it's really dependent upon how many people tender the bonds, if and when that begins. I think the FANG 2025 notes is also a chess piece that goes into that. And I think we're pretty close to starting that process with the shareholder vote coming up in March 16. So we wanted to take advantage of these rates with three goals. We want to pay down gross debt overall over time at our discretion, we want to lower average interest rate, and we want a longer average term to maturity. And I think we're setting ourselves up to accomplish that. Yeah. With the caveat that, we do need to work on some restricted covenants and some reporting requirements on the QEP notes because we don't anticipate reporting as two separate companies for a long time. So I think Pioneer, Conoco, Chevron have all followed different or similar paths in handling the notes of the company they acquired, and we're going to copy one of those. Thanks, Charles. I mean, I think, we're getting way ahead of ourselves, Jeanine, on that. But I think we've proven to be pretty smart when it comes to spin-offs, but I think my head might explode if we thought about another spin-off right now. So we're going to just, first, get our numbers down. Second, invest smartly or wisely with bigger partners, and then third, figure out how to monetize down the line. But certainly, we're very cognizant of the multiples that, that side of the business gets versus an oil and gas company right now, but that's not the reason why we're doing this."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. And welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. Diamondback continue to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's strategy to move activity to our most productive areas in the second quarter of 2020 is now starting to pay dividends in terms of capital efficiency and early time well performance. Well costs and cash operating costs remain near all-time lows, and our average completed lateral length in the fourth quarter was over 13,000 lateral feet, a company record. These operational achievements will translate directly into increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months. We are still operating in a market supported by supply that's being purposefully withheld to allow global inventories to decline as demand recovers from the depths of the global pandemic. Diamondback continues to see no need to grow oil production into this artificially undersupplied market and instead, plans to hold fourth quarter 2020 production flat, while generating free cash flow used to pay our dividend and pay down debt. The Board's decision to increase our dividend by 7% exhibits its confidence in the forward development plan released today, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged, hold production flat in the most capital-efficient manner, with free cash flow used for our dividend and to pay down debt. Growing our dividend and paying down debt are not mutually exclusive, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used for debt pay down in 2021. The fourth quarter of 2020 built on the momentum started in the third quarter with free cash flow increasing to over $242 million, up 58% from the $153 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter last year. We expect this trend to continue in 2021, where we currently expect to generate nearly $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 oil pro forma for the closing of our acquisition of Guidon this Friday. This free cash flow implies a reinvestment ratio below 60% at $50 oil and the mid-point of our $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion capital budget for this year. Note that our CapEx guidance includes the addition of approximately $100 million of capital for the Guidon acquisition, which encompasses one net operated rig added, as well as associated infrastructure and environmental spend. Our production guidance that ties to this capital budget for 2021 assumes that we hold Diamondback's expected fourth quarter oil production of 170 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day flat, plus 10-months of the 12,000 barrels of oil per day that Guidon was producing at time of acquisition announcement. This production guidance also accounts for the estimated impact of the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin last week, which we estimate to have knocked out the equivalent of 100% of our production for four to five days. Production has nearly returned to pre-storm levels as of today, and we expect to make up a majority of the lost production throughout the year, but will not be able to make it all up in the first quarter. The stockholder meeting to vote on our pending merger with QEP Resources is scheduled for March 16th. The merger is expected to close shortly thereafter, subject to QEP stockholder approval. Should the deal approve, we will update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable after closing. While this creates a noisy first quarter in terms of production additions, it will also create a clean look at the pro forma business in the second quarter and beyond. We have only one material term debt maturity due in the next four years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note when it is callable at par later this year. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due 2025 that's currently callable, providing optionality for further gross debt reduction as free cash flow materializes. Turning to ESG. Diamondback today announced a major initiative relating to ESG performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emissions intensity reduction targets, as well as a commitment to point forward Scope 1 carbon neutrality or Net Zero Now. We are committing to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024, and we are committing to reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% from 2019 levels, also by 2024. A detailed breakdown of our Scope 1 and methane emissions from 2019 can be seen on pages 13 and 14 of our latest investor presentation. Diamondback expects to continue to reduce flaring, which is now down almost 90% from 2019 levels, directly impacting over 50% of our 2019 Scope 1 emissions. We also expect to spend approximately $15 million a year over the next four years to retrofit about 600 of our tank batteries with air-powered pneumatic control systems, replacing methane-emitting gas-operated pneumatic control systems. These two changes will be significant drivers in reducing our carbon footprint, but other initiatives like methane leak detection and full field electrification will also have a direct impact on our emissions reduction strategy. Diamondback today also announced the Net Zero Now initiative, which means that as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to be produced with zero net Scope 1 emissions. The GHG and methane intensity reduction targets mentioned earlier are the primary focus, as it relates to our environmental responsibility. But we recognize we will still have a carbon footprint. Therefore, carbon offset credits will be purchased to offset our remaining emissions. Eventually, we expect Diamondback or one of our subsidiaries to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset our remaining Scope 1 emissions, but the credits are a bridge to that time and place. With these major announcements, Diamondback has chosen to adopt a strategy to operate with the highest level of environmental responsibility. Our social and environmental license to operate as a public oil and gas company based in the United States is going to be influenced by our capital providers, and we do not expect our investor pressure for oil and gas companies to improve their environmental performance to subside anytime soon. It is incumbent on us to improve our environmental performance and compete for capital in an industry with ever increasing external pressures. Carbon emissions are a cost, and Diamondback is working to become the low-carbon operator, in addition to our leadership position, as the operator with the lowest capital and operating cost. I am very excited about Diamondback's current position and the strength of our forward outlook, as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase announced yesterday. We are forecasting significant consistent free cash flow generation, translating into returns to shareholders. We look forward to successfully closing and integrating the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, and we'll update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Well, certainly, Arun. That's a good problem to have, right? And I think our cost structure really magnifies our ability to generate that free cash flow. First, the operating metrics of the company continue to just look outstanding. So I'm really excited about that, and we've evidenced it now, for a couple of quarters. But at the board level, we consistently talk about leaning into the base dividend and continuing to enhance our shareholder as a form - as a way of enhancing our shareholder return program. And it's really, like I said, a problem of blessings to have that kind of free cash flow. We want to continue to work the debt quantum down, which we intend to do so. And we'll do like we've always done, and be creative in returning that money back to our shareholders. I've been very demonstrative in our stance of not trying to grow production. So any fears that we're going to take money and start drilling more wells with it this year is just off the table. So it's a good problem to have. Yeah. Neal, I mean, we had a pretty high flaring number in 2019, and it was pretty frustrating to us that, that number was as high as it was. Unfortunately, it was that high because we had a gas processor who had a percent of proceeds contract that was losing money on that contract, and therefore, it wasn't very fair on how much they sent us to flare versus some of their other contracts. So, we took that price risk and decided to restructure that contract into a fixed fee deal. And you can see in the flaring numbers, our numbers have come down dramatically, mostly because of that particular contract moving to fixed fee. Now, with NGLs and gas rallying, that fixed fee stays the same, and we get the benefit as the operator. So that's helping a lot. I don't think it had a lot of impact on - from a storm perspective. I think our field organization during the storm actually stepped up to get power - or get natural gas flowing back to local power plants in the Permian, which eased the problem and stopped the rolling blackouts in the Permian almost immediately. So two separate items, but certainly proud of the field organization for what they did for the cities of Midland and Odessa. Yeah. I mean, I think, Neil, the rigs, the efficiencies continue to creep up, but we're going to run, I think, nine rigs essentially average for the year to drill 190 wells with 75% of that in the Midland Basin, all over 10,000 feet. But really, the efficiency that's improved is on the frac side. I mean, I think our completion cadence, we're expecting to complete 220 or 225 wells, all over 10,000 feet with three Simul-Frac crews and one spot crew. So, really, the efficiency on both sides is pretty dramatic. And you can see that also in the lateral length, right? I mean we completed over 13,000 average lateral feet in Q4. And we're looking for opportunities throughout our entire asset base to push lateral length to that 12,500 or 15,000 foot range. Gail, we're not trying to buy our way into carbon neutrality. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the purchasing of these carbon credits are really just a bridge until we get our operations enhanced and maybe look at some other future investments down the road. But we're really trying to invest in the future. And you know how tight Diamondback runs our CapEx. And spending money on tax credits actually provides us a great incentive to not use those by doing the right things out in the field, like Kaes was mentioning, and articulating to effectuate these changes. And it's a nice bridge in the interim, but that's not the focus of what this initiative is about. Gail, I just want to return to your question that you asked earlier and reemphasize the point that we feel like we have a social and environmental license to operate. And I'll tell you, for the last multiple quarters, we've been really digging into this. But one of the things that surprised me was relatively, it's still a lot of money, but relatively how little cost is required to do the right thing here with regards particularly to methane emission and converting these tank batteries. And I think as other companies' kind of dig into that, I hope they find the same outcome that it is real dollars and it is real shareholder funds that we're diverting away from the drill bit, but it's not as bad as maybe what we were originally thinking. And again, I just go back to our environmental and social license and trying to do the right thing here. Thank you, Gail. And yeah, it does sting a little bit, but I think it's the right thing to do. Good morning, David. Yeah. David, good question. I mean, I think the beauty of the Guidon and QEP assets as they sit relative to our position is that you have - they all fit hand and glove. And so that gives us an opportunity to push lateral lengths for one of our - what will be our biggest operating area for the next few years. So I'd put 10,000 as the floor. We still have rigs running outside of that main block. But if we're having - and we're going to have half of our rigs running in the big block in Martin County, I'd expect those five rigs probably average a little higher than 10,000, whereas the rest of the position might be a little below it. So could we get it up to - up 10%? I think that's possible. But again, the teams are doing their work. And the contiguous nature of that block is going to promote a lot of capital efficiency. No, David, it's - we can't pay attention to weekly changes in commodity price. We have to try to do the best thing, the right thing from a reservoir performance all the time. And we're not getting enamored or stars in our eyes with higher commodity price. Thank you, David. Yeah, just, just to re-emphasize the point I made earlier about, we're still in an undersupplied world and, yeah, we can see the tea leaves talking about a supercycle, but that's not where we are today. I think just that - just in the final analysis Scott, growth down and back, we'll have to see a fundamental shift in the macro supply, demand. But future growth is not something we're scared of. Now, as Kaes pointed out, hyper-growth is probably still not a role, but, growth when it drives incremental shareholder returns, it is part of our long-term decision matrix. But, right now, we simply don't need to grow, right, with this much excess storage and steel production capacity out there in the world. But I think trying to put ourselves into a decision, straight-jacket is anticipating an old supercycle is not is not good business for us right now. Yeah, Scott. I'm going let Kaes to answer that, but I just, you provided me an opportunity to talk about how pleased we are with our operation performance, operational performance. We saw it in the fourth quarter. We saw it in January. And had not been historic 100-year storm out in the Permian. February we'd be looking good as well. So, really, really pleased at the way that we're executing right now in our operation performance. Hey, Scott. I kind of see it more as we're going to have a really large block in Martin County that we can put a lot of rigs to work pretty consistently, so long as we have the infrastructure in place, and we expect to do so. So I think with QEP, pending that deal closing, that 75% Midland number is going to go up, and hopefully, it stays kind of in that 75% to 85% of lateral footage consistently for the next three to five years. I think that's a little lower percentage of total capital, but it's going to be a pretty high percent of our net lateral footage for a long time here. Thanks, Scott. Thank you, Derrick. But Derrick, I'll also add that while we don't - there's not specific EOR projects underway with 85% or 90% of the oil still left in the ground, even with the most advanced completions technologies, we know that enhanced oil recovery is a part of our industry's future. And there are some guys out there kind of on the leading edge that Diamondback, as our style, we're following very closely to see if they're having success. But it would be nice if those two things were - had the same mutual objectives, carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery and tight horizontally developed shale resources. But as Kaes pointed out, we're just barely getting started on that. I mean it's kind of what we gave. I mean QEP has put out some high-level numbers on their full year 2021. So I think it's fair to look at those numbers. Now, if you think about us closing the deal in March, we'll only have cash CapEx for three quarters of that. But at current cost estimates, like I said, I think the mid-point of our guidance is 8% to 10% above where current well costs are. So, if we stay the same, you could chop 8% to 10% off of that and get a solid maintenance number. Thanks, Derrick. Yeah. What we've seen in the past, Jeff, when we go through one of these cycles of rapid commodity price increases, names that you would have thought would have come off the board - public names that would have come off the board, probably now have a lot greater runway with the higher commodity price. So usually, when you see these kinds of cycles accelerate, it makes, from a macro perspective, A&D harder to do. But just like Kaes was saying, though, we've got Guidon and soon to be QEP to roll in the mix and we're very comfortable with where our inventory sits right now in terms of runway in front of us. So I just want to add that in as well. Yeah. It should help a little bit, 100 to 200 bps of oil mix. I think that's why we started guiding to oil separately from BOEs. The BOEs continue to outperform, primarily because flaring is down 5%, which has resulted in a lot higher BOE numbers and BOE reserves. So Midland certainly is oilier and moving to Midland, Northern Midland is going to help. But the production base is pretty large right now, so I think it's in the range of 100 to 200 bps, not more than that. Thank you, Jeff. Yeah. Brian, I think - I know you're asking those questions to those individual operators. But from a macro perspective, what I'm seeing is that we still are undersupplied on rigs to keep the Permian Basin flat. So you may see some rig adds coming, but right now, it's probably not enough to offset the production declines that we've seen through the lack of investment over the last 12 months. So I believe, and maybe I'm the internal optimist, but I believe if moving through the depths of a global apocalypse that was created by this pandemic, if oil and gas companies haven't got discipline now, they probably never will. So I'm optimistic that the industry is going to tow the line on capital discipline, irrespective of commodity prices. Now there will be some time in the future, a signal when supply has worked off and Iranian barrels are absorbed and surplus OPEC capacities has consumed that the world will be signaling for growth. But as we tried to articulate earlier, the days of hyper growth in the shale industry should be part of our history, not part of our future. But I'll tell you, just adding to that, and I know you guys get tired of hearing me talk about our operations and our low cost. But as the low-cost producer, almost irrespective of commodity price, we're going to drive the highest returns to our shareholders. Yeah. No, Brian, I don't see those core competencies inside Diamondback, and it's unlikely that we would branch out into trying to say that we can become a better solar company or a better wind farm company than pre-existing. I think that's actually a trap that some companies get into as they try to diversify into areas where they're not experts. We at Diamondback know what the main thing is and the main thing is, is for us to produce barrels at the highest cash margin with the lowest cost and now the lowest carbon footprint. So I think the most likely scenario would be that we participate alongside a subject matter expert in whatever that carbon capture technology is. Yeah. Richard, we're not trying to buy our way into carbon neutrality. We're trying to be very specific. You can see on slides 12, 13 and 14 in our investor deck how much transparency we're using to try to describe exactly what we're going to do. We've been very prescriptive in talking about 600 tank batteries that need to be retrofitted and spending $10 million to $15 million a year over the next three to four years in order to make that happen. So our focus is not to try to buy our way into carbon neutrality. Our focus is how can we invest to eliminate our Scope 1 emissions. And the carbon credits now provide us a bridge, and quite honestly, provides us an incentive because I don't like spending that money, but it provides us an incentive to get the operations in the shape that they need to be. And that's what we need for our shareholders, and that's what our industry needs as well, too. And I hope other companies can take a similar examination of what efforts they're doing to reduce methane emissions, particularly. Thanks, Richard. Yeah. Look, Leo, we're very comfortable with where we are right now, particularly with these two deals closing, one Friday and then one in a couple of weeks after that. So, we're very comfortable where we are. And we'll just - like we always do, we monitor the landscapes, and if we think we can deliver outstanding returns to our shareholders, then we'll take a look at it. But in terms of inventory life and all of that, we're very comfortable with where we are. Hey, Charles. Yeah. I mean, we're going to add one rig net for the Guidon deal, and that rig is going to drill a 10or 12 well pad here throughout the year. And that pad is going to come on early next year. And then, I think, I can't speak to the QEP development plan. But I think as soon as we can move rigs to that big block in Southeast Martin County, we're going to move two or three rigs there and be active there for the next five, even, eight years. Thanks, Charles. Hey, Jeanine. Yeah, we are Jeanine. And we're pretty focused on US carbon credits versus international. International, you can get a little cheaper, but I don't think that ties directly to our license to operate in the US. So the couple of projects that we've invested in, two of them are based in Texas, one of them is based in Wyoming, and that's our start. I think we're going to build a good relationship with our partners on this and eventually work to invest directly. But I think overall, with us executing on this initiative, there's going to be a lot of inbound phone calls on opportunities. And I just think our goal is to make sure what we do invest in ties more directly to what we produce rather than other environmental aspects. Yeah. Janine, we want to make sure we emphasize - keeping the main thing, I said that earlier. And we know what we're really good at, and we know what we're still learning at. And we're going to focus on what we're really good at, and we'll participate alongside someone that's really good at something else. And as Kaes said, for another fourth company or fourth entity, that's not - that doesn't sound very good to me right now. So I think our focus is going to be doing the right thing at Diamondback operations to drive down our emissions intensity. Thanks, Jeanine. Thank you. Occasionally, I'll use my closing remarks to add a message that's kind of directed towards our organization and a message I think sometimes important for our investors to hear that separates from sort of the standard quarter. This past week, as we're all acutely aware of, the Permian Basin experienced unprecedented weather event. We had over 220 hours of below freezing weather. And really across the Permian Basin, we had extended periods of no electricity and water supplies frozen and really, against all of that, we had a frozen and a dark oilfield. And our field organization, and in some cases, these individuals working over 20 hours a day, they were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants. They weren't working to get Diamondback's volumes flowing and back online earlier because of our quarterly objectives. They were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants that were - honestly, that were sitting idle, particularly on the West side of Odessa. And they were sitting idle because they didn't have any fuel. And through our efforts and other operators' efforts, gas was delivered and Texas had power. This occurred Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning. And by Thursday, most of Texas, again, had power. And it's - I just want to - the efforts that were displayed by many individuals in the Permian Basin transcends normal procedures for returning production in the Permian Basin is grateful for - we're really grateful for everything that you guys did. You answered the call and you put forth a heroic effort that will not be forgotten. Just want to tell you publicly, thank you for everything that you guys did. So with that, thanks for everyone participating in today's call. And if you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Thanks, Lateef."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Victor. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice .\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. Diamondback continued with our trend of cost reductions in the third quarter, with LOE and G&A remaining near all-time lows and capital cost per lateral foot continuing to decline to new records. Our drilling and completion operations continued to gain efficiencies and current well costs are now 30% lower than 2019 levels in both the Midland and Delaware Basin. We're also beginning to see the benefits from high grading our development programs since the downturn started in our latest well results and have all of the impact of curtailments from the second quarter in the rearview mirror.  As a result of this high grading and improved capital efficiency, we're on track to meet our fourth quarter average oil production target of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels per day and expect to carry this momentum into 2021 as the baseline for our maintenance capital development plan in 2021. We expect to execute on this capital plan with 25% to 35% less capital than 2020. And this plan implies a reinvestment ratio of about 70% at $40 oil. To be clear, this maintenance capital scenario is currently the base case for our operations through the end of 2021. But if commodity prices weaken further and sustain that weakness for an extended period, we will exhibit capital discipline and industry leadership by cutting capital and activity levels further.  The conversation on industry has moved towards touting reinvestment ratios and corporate breakevens, but has shifted away from answering the question of whether or not an operator's development plan is generating sufficient returns and creating net present value for that company's shareholders. While our 2021 corporate maintenance capital breakeven of low 30s WTI before paying our dividend should be considered best-in-class, that scenario will not happen. If we're operating at or near breakeven we will be spending less than maintenance capital to preserve upside for our shareholders and will instead need to conserve cash flow to pay our dividend and to pay down debt.  Put very simply, our forward capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We will protect our dividend, spend maintenance capital at most and use excess free cash flow to pay down debt. If our expected free cash flow will not cover our dividend, then we will cut capital to ensure our dividend is protected.  The third quarter of 2020 provided a preview of this new operating model as we generated $153 million of consolidated free cash flow in the quarter, most of which was used to reduce consolidated net debt by $137 million.  Looking ahead, we have only one material term debt maturity due in the next 4 years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note by early 2021 to further reduce absolute debt. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until the end of 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due in 2025 that's currently callable providing optionality for future gross debt reduction.  Turning briefly to ESG. Diamondback is committed to environmental stewardship and delivering best-in-class performance and reducing our carbon footprint. While owning and operating assets that are positioned on the low end of the global oil cost of supply curve is most important to our stockholders, we recognize it's also important to own and operate assets that are also positioned on the low end of the greenhouse gas emissions cost of supply curve. Diamondback supports public policies that eliminate routine flaring as long as those policies protect the safety of our operations and consider flaring contributions from all segments of the oil and gas industry.  Upstream and midstream operators must continue to work together to address the flaring issue for our industry. Diamondback has been proactive in reducing our flaring by using our balance sheet to build infrastructure to ensure every development well completed is ready to be connected to each respective midstream gatherer. And we will not flow back a well, if that's not the case.  We've also restructured gathering and processing contracts at our expense by converting contracts from a persona proceeds contract to a fixed fee contract so the gatherer does not have an economic excuse not to take our gas. This puts all of the commodity exposure on us as the operator, but ensures that our gas is not flared. Flaring was responsible for over 50% of Diamondback's Scope 1 emissions in 2019.  With flaring per net BOE produced down 54% year-to-date, our Scope 1 emissions have materially declined this year, demonstrating our commitment to environmental responsibility.  Next, on the topic of industry consolidation and M&A, we believe that consolidation in our sector is necessary as our sector is too fragmented, but that's changed rapidly. Industry consolidation has long been anticipated in U.S. shale and has been touted as an avenue to create scale and improve cost efficiencies. Today, Diamondback is a leader in cost and efficiency. The success of the acquisitions we've executed to date were largely driven by realizing hundreds of millions of dollars of savings through lower costs and higher returns than from the previous operators.  A well drilled in the Permian Basin by Diamondback today will be quicker, less expensive and operated with the lowest cost structure in the business. So we do not need to increase our scale to further reduce our cost structure. We produced 300,000 barrels per day at the lowest cash and capital costs in the industry. We also have an investment-grade balance sheet with a proven access to capital even through this pandemic. There's not a piece of the supply chain that would be better for Diamondback if we were bigger than we are today for midstream contracts to service availability to access to capital. These facts should prove to investors that we have the scale necessary to compete in this industry. Touting and arbitrary numbers such as a level of production our market cap deemed to be relevant in our space is both specious and self-serving. This commentary is only coming from companies with those arbitrary characteristics and is not based in fact or proven through operational metrics.  Diamondback is not getting left behind if we don't do anything today, and we prefer not to make rash decisions at the bottom of the cycle. Patience will be rewarded at the end of the day, and we have the balance sheet, cost structure and asset-based -- asset base to be patient and ride out this downturn as brutal as it may be.  Getting bigger does not always translate to getting better. Better is what should matter to shareholders. and better does not mean that financial metrics are improved in that first year. Better means the acquirer adds inventory that competes for capital right away at a relative value that's accretive to the acquirer shareholders, not the targets. Whether the transaction is an MOE or selling the company or buying something, the transaction must translate to being better for our shareholders who own the company. If that is the case, then that's what we'll do.  To finish, we operate in a cyclical business. And while this downturn has been as severe as any in industry history, Diamondback has the size, scale, balance sheet, asset quality and cost structure to weather a prolonged downturn and thrive in the inevitable upcycle. We are generating and expect to continue to generate free cash flow, and we will allocate that free cash flow to our dividend and debt reduction until commodity prices meaningfully recover from current levels.  With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase.\nArun Jayaram: Travis, it's clear from your commentary that you believe you have sufficient scale to effectively compete in the Permian without M&A. That being said, I was wondering if you could give us your views on the A&D market? Because it does appear to be what several of your peers have characterized as a buyer's market. We saw a natural gas deal, obviously, not in the Permian, which was recently transacted at a PV17 valuation. So maybe just start with your thoughts on what you're seeing in the A&D market?\nTravis Stice: Well, let me just circle back to -- you reemphasized my point on scale. There's not a single service company that's calling us up and saying, hey, you're not big enough. We're not going to be able to do business with you. I think we've laid out a pretty good case for how you should think about Diamondback in terms of size and scale and balance sheet and execution metrics. But as it pertains to M&A, it's hard for me to forecast M&A. I think you got to go back and just focus on the words that I said, we're going to grow our asset base just like we've always done, only when it -- we can show that we can drive shareholder value. And that has been the same since the -- in October of 2012 when we took the company public, that's what we come in to work for thinking about every day, is how can we drive shareholder value. And if it comes through execution or it comes through M&A, that's what we'll do.\nArun Jayaram: And just my follow-up is one of the drivers of the reduction in your cash cost guidance was lower LOE. And I think that some of that, Travis, has been a shift towards gas lift from ESPs. I was just wondering maybe if you could articulate how your artificial lift strategy has evolved and any implications for go-forward LOE and decline rates?\nTravis Stice: Sure. I'm really proud of our operations organization. And particularly, this skill set on gas lift really came through the legacy Energen folks, and it's a tribute to those guys. They showed us how we could accomplish our lift mechanism using gas lift as opposed to what Diamondback's legacy operation practice was with ESPs. Now we still have a lot of ESPs in the ground. But we've been making a fundamental shift in going from ESPs to gas lift, and we're seeing a significant reduction in cost savings.  And at the same time, we're not seeing any detrimental impact on performance, so something we're really excited about. And I mean, if you just step all the way back from it, these ESPs, while it's pretty easy just to crank the wrist up or down in response to volume needs. At the end of the day, you're hanging an electric motor in water, 1.5 mile on the ground with an extension cord, and there's nothing but bad things can happen in that scenario.  So there's still going to be a part of our operating plan, ESPs will be. But we're really excited about some of the leading-edge technologies we're deploying with gas lift. And listen, just on the expense side, our focus has always been to be the lowest cost operating in Permian basin. But we've got an organization that understands that for every $0.01 that we save in costs, whether it's LOE or G&A, that translates to $1 million of cash flow that we can return to shareholders or whatever.  So when you have a mindset that's focused on pennies, from the Boardroom, out to our field organization, that's how you ultimately end up driving best-in-class cost structures, which is what Diamondback consistently delivers on.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Deckelbaum from Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Curious, you referenced the high grading benefits that you're seeing right now on execution of this 2020 plan. Can you talk about how you see high grading influencing '21 plan? You sort of pegged this free cash flow at $525 million at $40. Are you seeing further benefits going into '21 from high grading? And how long, I guess, as you think about -- you emphasize the scale that Diamondback has, how long do you think you could sustain at a maintenance level this high graded program for?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, David, I think we made some very tough decisions at the end of Q1 and into Q2 as we ramped down from 23 rigs to 5 today. While we did that, we did move the drill schedule to higher Midland basin percentage of total capital. We've kind of put the worst of our lease obligations behind us in the Delaware Basin and now can focus on drilling and completing our best stuff first.  And while you're in a world where we're completing 350 wells a year and running 23 rigs, that might be a little more difficult than today, when we're running 6 rigs and completing less than 200 wells a year. So finally seeing the well results and the productivity improvements from moving to a higher Midland basin percentage of capital combined with high Viper interest, as you saw in the Viper results for this quarter and lower midstream and infrastructure spend.  So all that results in a little more capital efficiency, and I think a nice setup from a well result rate of change story heading into next year. And then on your second comment, how long can we sustain that? I think we've been as transparent as anybody in this industry on what our location count looks like. We've had it in our decks for the last 3 years and with well costs coming down to where they are today, our Midland Basin productivity can stay at or above 2021 levels for a multiple -- multiyear period. I don't know what the exact number of years is. It depends on what happens with oil price and activity, but we're confident we can stay flat with less capital going forward as decline rates come down and productivity goes up.\nTravis Stice: David, I can tell you from my chair and looking at this kind of 2/3 Midland Basin, 1/3 Delaware or 3/4, 25%, that capital allocation looking out for the next, I don't know, four to six quarters, I'm as confident in our forward plan as I've ever been. I mean we're really fired on all cylinders, on execution, on cost reductions and very confident in this forward plan to be able to deliver what our shareholders expect.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate that. And just my follow-up is on the '21 plan. I think you mentioned midstream and infrastructure spending coming down next year. Can you clarify those comments a little bit more and maybe talk about some of the benefits or value creation you see evolving out of Viper and Rattler back to FANG holders?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, David. So you know what, I think we've kind of said that midstream and infrastructure will be down another 50% or so next year from this year's levels. And that -- if you look back to two years ago, that's about 25% or 30% of the levels that we had in 2019. So all of that's coming down. It allows us to spend more capital on the drill bit versus the easy ancillary stuff that does have a benefit and does reduce our cost structure.  But with the slowdown, we're not having to add a lot of disposal capacity or oil gathering capacity or a lot of new batteries because we're utilizing our existing infrastructure efficiently. So looking forward to that continuing to decrease. And then as you mentioned, on the Viper and Rattler side, those 2 businesses are still very strategic to us. They provide a lot of free cash flow up to the parent in the form of distributions. Both of them are fine from a leverage perspective. And therefore, you're going to get more cash up to the parent in 2021 from those 2 companies than even 2020.\nTravis Stice: David, I just want to circle back on your question of inventory. Kaes articulated that we're only going to burn maybe 150 wells per year on the Midland Basin side of things. That translates to years of future inventory. When I talked about confidence in the next several quarters, that doesn't mean that I'm not confident in the next several years. I'm -- we've got 350,000 acres here in the Permian. And the slower we go, the more towards maintenance capital we and the industry goes. It just extends whatever the perception of inventory life is, that just extends it out because we're just not playing through it at the same pace we were last year when we were running 20-plus rigs. So I hope that clarifies that a little bit.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens.\nGail Nicholson: You guys are entering a phase of very attractive free cash generation on a myriad of oil prices, when you look at debt paydown, what is the appropriate amount of immediate debt paydown versus making sure you have cash on the balance sheet if the commodity price continues to be volatile?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, Gail. I think, first and foremost, we need to have $191 million on our balance sheet to pay off our September 2021 note. And as Travis mentioned in his opening remarks, we plan to have that cash by early Q1 of next year. On top of that, we do have the fortune of having a former high-yield bond in our 2025 bond that's callable. So unlike the IG bonds that we have outstanding that are bullet maturities, we do have some flexibility in paying down that bond by calling it. I don't know when that's going to happen, but that's the logical next step.  And overall, I think while we're not big hoarders of cash, we should keep more of a cash balance than we have in the past given the volatility as well as the issues that come up with bullet maturities. You've got to have cash on the balance sheet to be able to handle those. And I think our plan is to make sure we have a little more cushion and rely less on bank financing overall.\nGail Nicholson: And then looking at your free cash flow scenario on Page 7 of the presentation, you guys are using a 95% WTI realization there. I believe by the fourth quarter, 60% of your volumes should be getting Brent pricing. So I was just curious what Brent-WTI differential you're using for that 95% WTI realization?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. So we're using $3 there. That ratio is a little tighter right now. And because we're more exposed to Brent, the narrower Brent-WTI or Brent Midland spread has hurt us a little bit. I'm ignoring the fact that we do pay ourselves via our ownership in the pipeline to get to the Gulf Coast. But should that Brent-WTI spread widen, we'll naturally benefit. So I think on our Brent realized pricing, we're kind of realizing a Brent less $5 or $6. And for the rest, you're realizing an MEH price or a Midland direct price for now.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Neil Deman from Tourist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Travis, for you and Kaes, you were talking about the productivity and your confidence, I'm just wondering, is that -- would you all say the largest driver of this productivity? I mean, is it more driven by the asset location or just operational efficiencies? Or is it just kind of all of the above? And kind of what gives you that confidence? It sounds like you have now for the next few quarters.\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, I think it's all of the above, Neal. I mean, I don't think anyone's ever questioned Diamondback's cost structure, our ability to execute on the capital side. But overall, I do think the Street does look at these curves intently. And I think we're -- particularly on the Midland Basin side, focused on putting out some better curves over the next few quarters, if not years. And we've seen that drive positive rate of change stories on the Street, and we hope the Street picks that up as well.\nNeal Dingmann: Okay. And then just to follow-up, Travis, what you were saying on scale. Do -- you believe we continue to hear a lot of chatter. You have to have more scale. Is that more -- I don't know, I guess I've heard folks say that about having a more -- turning out more optimal pads, having more optimal areas in plays. Maybe you could comment around that? I mean, again, it seems like there's still a lot of chatter around that. I just wanted to hear maybe more of your color around how you view you all versus sort of the peers when it comes to -- again, maybe some others might have a bit more scale, but when it comes to optimal design and those sort of things?\nTravis Stice: Yes, Neal, listen, that commentary that's out there is just -- it's not based in fact. I mean at the end of the day, Diamondback is -- we're completing these wells as fast as anybody in the basin with 2 pads at the same time with these simul-frac operations. All of our supply chain is tight. We're not at any disadvantage based on size and scale.  And I think some of the commentary is because people are struggling with wider cost structures disconnected from Diamondback's cost structure. And so the commentary navigates towards size and scale because it's difficult to point to why down if I can do it so much cheaper and so much faster. I don't know, I mean, you need to ask the people that are making those comments why they're making those comments because it's certainly, from my shareholders' perspective -- our shareholders' perspective, that's not what we're seeing nor hearing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nitin Kumar from Wells Fargo.\nNitin Kumar: I would like to revisit the whole concept of industry consolidation. A lot of your peers in their commentary, not only mentioned scale, but talked about just maybe a little bit of a tough environment to operate in. Your comments suggest a bit of optimism knowing that you don't have a crystal ball, just kind of maybe talk about your macro view from here and what you're seeing that gives you the confidence to go it alone?\nTravis Stice: Well, there's certainly some significant headwinds on the commodity space right now. I mean we've got the election uncertainty and looming policy changes, if there's an administration change. We've got COVID that's still -- we're still struggling to -- how to contain that. And is there going to be a vaccine anytime soon, and what does that mean to the supply demand recovery? We've got OPEC+ meeting in December to talk about whether they maintain cuts or start easing those cuts, and then we've got a global inventory overhang that's still there. All of those are macro issues that I can't control, and we can't influence. But what we can do is continue to focus on the cost structure and how we execute on our development plan, how we demonstrate confidence in our base dividend and how in improving commodity price world, we take advantage of an increasing our shareholder-friendly returns program.  We've already addressed -- we're addressing our debt issue right now. So look, this 2020 -- let's be clear, this has been a global apocalyptic event, not only for citizens at large, but certainly for our industry. And we're at a point now where we feel very confident in the business plan that we have in place. We feel very confident in our ability to execute and consistently deliver on that business plan.  And we also feel like we're enough of an adult in the way that we look at things, if they get worse from here, we'll change our behaviors, and we'll slow down and preserve capital. So there's nothing for me not to confident be in. And there is uncertainty ahead of us in the commodity price world. But I'm confident in the people we have at Diamondback, and I'm confident in the communication we have with our shareholders about what it is we're trying to accomplish.\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. And Nitin, this business is not easy right now. There's no denying that, but that doesn't mean we're going to capitulate at the bottom of the cycle. I think Travis said it in his prepared remarks that we're not going to make a rash decision at the bottom of the cycle. And anything that happens, means you have to get better, not necessarily bigger, to ride out of storm. This is not an easy business. We have plenty of our production hedged on the downside in 2021 and as Travis said, if things get worse, we'll have to make the tough decisions like we have already in 2020.\nTravis Stice: Look, Nitin, just one other point. At the bottom of the cycle, which I don't know if we're completely at the bottom of the cycle now. But even as bad as things have been in 2020, Diamondback is still a profitable company. We generated $153 million worth of free cash flow in the third quarter. We're paying our base dividend, which is yielding above the S&P 500, and we're reducing debt at the bottom of this cycle. And so if we can accomplish all of those things at the bottom of the cycle, think about what the world is going to look like for our shareholders as we start coming out of the other side of the cycle, which we know is inevitable, and we know that oil price will increase in the future. We just don't know when. But if we're profitable like this at the very bottom of the cycle. And that -- we're on the other side. We're good.\nNitin Kumar: I appreciate those comments. And certainly, it's a tough market, but you've done a great job. Maybe turning to that great job for a second here. Every quarter, you report slightly better D&C costs. I mean, you're down 30% from just a year ago. In 2021, you have about 110 to 140 DUCs to help those cap efficiencies. But at what point in '21, do you think you need to add costs? And more importantly, what do you think that might do to your D&C costs at that point?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. I mean there's no real sign that there's upward pressure on D&C costs today. Certainly, Nitin, if we got to 2021, we're not going to guide to all-time low well costs, and we do have about a 50 DUC tailwind helping us out in 2021. That'll be a nice benefit to us. But I think, overall, what we focus on is how many of these cost savings are permanent versus temporary. And while a good amount of these cost savings have been temporary, we have learned a lot in terms of drilling design in the Delaware Basin as well as completion design in the Midland Basin with the simul-frac crews that we're going to keep those savings for the long term.  So while we're not counting on service prices increasing anytime soon, we recognize those guys are dealing with a very tough down cycle just as we are. And at some point, service costs will go up, but that would probably coincide with higher commodity prices.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Derek Whitfield from Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: Kaes, perhaps staying with you on your cost comments. Could you comment on how much of the D&C improvement between '19 and current structural versus market?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. I mean, I'd say in the Delaware Basin, probably 50% is structural and 50% market. And then on the Midland Basin side, I'd say probably 1/3 is structural and 2/3 is market. We've already been pretty low on the cost curve, if not the lowest in the Midland Basin going into this downturn, and we have made some improvements with simul-frac and some cementing technology that we're implementing. But the Delaware has been where we've made significant progress. I mean, we drilled a second bone spring well in under 10 days, 10,000-foot well in under 10 days in Pecos County. I think our first wells in that area were 30-plus consistently. So those are the savings that are going to accrue to our shareholders long term. And those are the things we focus on rather than the -- picking up the phone and reducing the service costs.\nDerrick Whitfield: Understood. And then shifting to your 2021 outlook, would it be fair to assume there could be a downward bias in your maintenance capital projections for 2021 as we walk this equation forward in time with the significant reductions in capital costs you've achieved to date and the macro backdrop that likely will not change for at least through the first half of next year?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. But I think, Derek, the conversation needs to be is maintenance capital the right scenario? I think if we stay in the mid-30s and we get closer to our corporate breakeven I think the discussion needs to turn to, are you generating positive NPV for your shareholders at those prices? So certainly, there's a lot of headwinds on the commodity side, and we're going to keep that 25% to 35% range out there, and we've kept it out there just due to the uncertainty rather than lowering it or changing it through this year.\nTravis Stice: Derrick, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments Kaes made about those permanent cost savings, 50% of Delaware and 1/3 in the Midland Basin. You shouldn't lose sight of the point that those are structural cost improvements on -- and operated. It's already the lowest or the best-in-class in those execution measures. So it's not a casual exercise from our operations organization to continue when they're already leading to drive costs out, but I'm just really proud of what they've been able to accomplish.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Asit Sen from Bank of America.\nAsit Sen: Scope 1 emission reduction of over 50% year-over-year was pretty significant and impressive. Just wondering what your plans are on emissions going forward? Are -- the lower hanging fruits already been addressed. And how are you thinking about handling the policy change with the potential new administration and how you plan to navigate the regulatory framework that looks like it's changing?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: I'll let Travis handle regulatory after I talk -- clarify one thing. Flaring is down 50% -- or sorry, a little over 50% year-to-date. And flaring makes up about 50% or 60% of our Scope 1 emission. So I think overall, Scope 1, probably down 25% to 35% in 2020 versus 2019 is more of a realistic number. We have made progress in our sustainability report to put out targets. I think we'll probably next come out with long-term targets, 4 or 5 year targets on all of the metrics that matter to our environmental scorecard, which we implemented this year. But overall, that's just a concerted effort between us and our midstream operator to reduce flaring overall. And I think we'll have a little bit of a tailwind as well with lower activity levels versus years prior, which makes up a smaller portion of those Scope 1 emissions.\nTravis Stice: Yes. I think as a general statement, Asit, American energy producers, we've got an important role in meeting the challenge of global climate change. We believe that climate policy has got to facilitate meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions, but it's also, at the same time, got to balance economic, environmental and energy security needs. And we've got to promote innovation solutions to this climate challenge. As Kaes highlighted, this year, we adopted emissions targets. And as part of our executive compensation plan. And we also -- uniquely, all of our employees, 737 employees of Diamondback, they share in that same bonus plan.  So those environmental measures are part of their cash bonus. So -- and I'd also tell you, while we've not finalized incentive comp for 2021, emissions targets are going to continue to be included in our comp plans, and we're likely to set multiyear emissions reduction targets. And listen, I hope all the industry -- I hope all of the energy producers can kind of take this as a challenge to step forth and take a stand on what it is that we're trying to accomplish.  We have an environmental and the social license to operate in the areas we live and work, and Diamondback's trying to -- we're trying to stand up and take a leadership position in that. And again, just back to that scale comment, we're doing this -- don't have to be big to do this. We're doing it. We're doing it at our current scale. So getting big to accomplish to accomplish environmental goals, again, we've proven that that's not the case. I think if you look at our flaring from this time a year ago, even year-to-date, we're down 50-some-odd percent. From this time a year ago, we're down almost 75%. So we've done what we needed to do, and we'll continue to lean into that until we've eliminated all routine flaring. And we expect that to be sooner rather than later as long as we can work collaboratively with our midstream providers.\nAsit Sen: Appreciate that, Travis. And Travis on the cycle, you talked about a tough down cycle that we are facing right now. And yet, you talked about an inevitable upcycle. What gives you the confidence in an upcycle? Just want to get your medium-term thoughts on the industry.\nTravis Stice: Sure. There's a couple of things. I mean, pick your energy expert forecaster. I mean the world is going to continue to need energy from liquid hydrocarbons for many, many years to come. And our population is continuing to grow. We understand that there's going to be the world that's striving for energy transition. But in the near term, supply and demand is going to rebalance. And when it does, that's going to lead to the inevitable rise in commodity price. I don't know when that's going to occur. But I think it's probably going to occur sooner rather than later. But we're positioned to -- like I said, weather this storm, as brutal as it's been. We'll continue to do what's the best thing for our shareholders. But I am constructive on commodity price long-term because of the supply demand fundamentals.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi Group.\nScott Gruber: So you guys have completed a few simul-frac wells now. What level of savings are you realizing on the simul-fracs wells? And is there any incremental benefit still come from simul-frac in your D&C figures? Or is that fully incorporated as we sit now?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, Scott, I mean, it's fully baked into our leading-edge Midland well cost, which we put D&C at $4.50 a foot. I mean I think we are push -- continuing to push the envelope on simul-frac. And I think even recently in the third quarter, we completed two pads, separate well pads at the same time with the simul-frac crew and those pads are about 1,000 feet apart. So that's -- pretty engineering feat from the team.  Overall, certainly, it can get more efficient. We're completing about 3,300 lateral feet a day. Some days, we're getting up to upwards of 4,000 lateral feet a day. So as those crews get more efficient, we'll continue to push the envelope there. But I also think the ancillary benefit is how quickly you can get into an area with existing production, complete a large pad and get out of that particular area so that your watered out production -- is watered out for a shorter period of time. So that's an unseen efficiency, but something that has been a positive rate of change for us since implementing the simul-frac crews. And on the cost side, we estimate it's about $25 or $30 a foot of savings per well on the completion side.\nScott Gruber: Got it. So obviously, a lot of operational savings. Do you see any benefit on well performance in aggregate from the two wells given the creation of two side-by-side fracture networks at the same time?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: It's certainly fair to assume that you're completing a larger tank at the same time and, therefore, not having as large of a parent-child effect. I mean, I can't put a number on it, but we do agree that more wells completed at the same time is better for the reservoir. And if you have the infrastructure and facilities in place, you're not spending large dollars there. Then it's a logical path forward.\nTravis Stice: I'll tell you, Scott, the other kind of knock-on effect of that is that the modeling that we have to do, which is -- has gotten more and more complex over the years is what we call the water out effect. But because we're completing these wells so much faster, almost twice as fast, that water out effect has really been positively impacted in terms of its length and duration and its overall impact because we're getting on and off these wells so much faster. Not something we really contemplated when we started simul-frac, but we've seen the benefits of that now.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line Jeff Grampp from Northland Capital.\nJeffrey Grampp: Curious on the dividend front, it seems like given the free cash flow that you guys are projecting next year, certainly fundable at low prices and seems safe. So how are you guys assessing the right time to maybe look at growing that? It seems like, Travis, as you pointed out, the yield on it is obviously very competitive. So perhaps that's something that needs to get kind of rectified organically before looking at dividend growth? Or just kind of you thoughts there would be great.\nTravis Stice: Yes, that's a good -- that was the reason I made that point earlier was the fact that our yield is already, what, at over 5%. So I'll just tell you that our Board is committed to that dividend is the primary form of our shareholder return program. And we talk about it at least every quarter, if not more frequently than that. But I've been -- I've tried to be very clear what our strategy is right now, it's to pay that base dividend at -- right now, it's above an S&P 500 yield and reduce debt. And as commodity price rises, well then we have options to do things with excess free cash flow above the dividend and debt reduction.\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. And Jeff, I think it's important to look back at earlier this year and the conviction it took to maintain that dividend through the down cycle or the worst of the down cycle. That was not an easy decision, particularly after we doubled the dividend in February. So I keep hearing about forward return of capital and what people are going to do. I think looking at our history and what we've leaned into in order to maintain that dividend, while others have either suspended theirs, cut it or even sold their companies should be reviewed by our shareholders.\nJeffrey Grampp: Yes. That's a Good point, Kaes. Appreciate that. And my follow-up, looking at the -- Slide 5 here on the new deck, you guys are suggesting I think 34 to 64 completions in 4Q. I know that's just kind of implied based on the guide. So just wondering if you guys can give us an indication of where you expect 4Q completions to fall in that range? And maybe it's kind of a related point, in the maintenance world for '21, how many fewer wells do you guys think get completed in '21 versus '20?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. I think overall, Q4 is probably at the midpoint, if not a bit above for completions now. It is dependent upon when those wells are turned to production. You do have 8 days of holidays at the end of the year. So there could be some noise in the amount of wells, but certainly, the midpoint-ish is a good guide. And then in 2021, I do think we are moving to more Midland Basin. So you do need more wells to keep production flat in the Midland Basin than you do in the Delaware. Those wells cost significantly less, but they produced less in that particular year. So I think a range around the upper half of what we put this year is likely, but we're still doing all the engineering and high grading the development plan to get those numbers out.\nOperator: . Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Hanold: Just a couple of follow-ups that are more specific to some of the Q&A that already occurred. But you talked a few times about seeing some better well performance recently. Can you quantify some of that and tell us how you feel confident that, that's what you expect going forward?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, Scott, I mean, listen, we look at production every day, and we look at individual well results every day. And what we're seeing is some really good pads that are coming on in the Midland Basin and outperforming our expectations as well as a few pads in the Delaware, particularly in the Vermejo area, that are also exceeding our expectations. So while I'm not going to give a number out, I think the message is increased confidence. And 2020 has been a tough year, where we were running 20 rigs in Q1 and completed a lot of wells in the Southern Delaware and then had to curtail a lot of wells in Q2. So I think we're starting to finally see the benefits of that reallocated capital plan in Q3 and Q4 and expect that to continue into 2021.\nScott Hanold: Okay. Fair enough. And then going back, obviously, to the plan in 2020 and maybe beyond, but you talk about obviously prioritizing the dividend and debt pay down. Can you give us -- can you walk us through what oil price or what amount of free cash flow gets you guys to look at things like a shareholder return or like growth? Or how does that conversation happen? I know it feels like we're a long way from there, but certainly, it's a relevant kind of topic to think about like where is that point that it comes to do one or both of those? And how does that work?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Well, I think we need to clarify that it's an increased shareholder return, right? Because we already are returning capital to shareholders in the form of our base dividend, which has the highest yield in the space. So I think that gets lost in the shuffle of some of this analyst commentary today.  But I think, Scott, we got to see a demand recovery and some stability in the forward outlook. And right now, there's about as many things working against us as an industry as they ever have been. And once those get clarity, and let's say we're safely into the high $40s WTI with a strip that is comfortably in that range, then I think we can have that conversation. But I don't want to have that conversation at $37 going to $38 today.\nScott Hanold: Yes. Is there a leverage level that you need to see first?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: No. Because leverage is a function of both EBITDA and gross debt. So I think as long as we're comfortable that we are reducing gross debt consistently, the additional return of capital is not mutually exclusive to our ability to reduce gross debt. I think the one thing that is off the table is significant growth. And those days are probably behind us. We've been as a bigger grower as anybody in this industry. But I think shareholders want cash, they want it now. And therefore, we're going to do that through our growing base dividend and also reducing the leverage issue to reduce our equity cost of capital and therefore, improve the stock price.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice.\nCharles Meade: Scott kind of front ran my question a little bit there, but I will try to push it a little bit further by looking at your Slide 6 in your presentation, and I just want to see if I'm interpreting this the right way. When I look at that graph you guys have for your investment framework on the left-hand part of the slide, to me, the message I get is that you guys wouldn't add any growth-directed CapEx until we were over $55, but then it's on the table over $55 WTI. Is that the right interpretation? Or is there something else there?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, Charles, I mean that would be a really good day versus where we've been over the last 9 months. So I'd be happy to have that conversation if we start to see a 5 handle on crude. But I think you've seen a lot of companies make a pledge that they're not going to grow over a certain amount. And I think it's hard to put this industry in a box, given how volatile it is. But I can say today that growth is off the table for us until we see significantly higher oil prices. And then that growth will be muted and somewhere in that single-digit range rather than the high double digits that we -- sorry, the low double digits or even teens that we've had in the past.\nTravis Stice: And I think the more germane question should be asked if those operators that are touting this future 2022 and beyond return to shareholders. I think the more important question should be, how does that look at a $36 world as opposed to what we're going to do when oil is $55 a barrel.\nCharles Meade: Right, Travis. I've appreciated the themes you've tried to amplify in your comments on that front. I think maybe -- this is -- I think this is kind of a big picture question more familiar territory. But when I talk to people who aren't involved in this space, one of the pushbacks we get is they say, well, these maintenance CapEx plans don't really seem to make sense. If it's not attractive to invest and grow your volumes, why do you want to invest to keep your volumes flat? And what are the other pieces of the picture that you'd put out there to try to answer that question about why it's important to keep production flat, if you can?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Just generally, I think you're raising the right question. The right question should be, what kind of returns are you generating on your capital program? If it's maintenance capital, what kind of returns do you generate in a $35, $36 a barrel. And if the answer is little to no returns to our investors, then why would you even keep volumes flat? That's what I tried to raise -- I tried to read that point in my prepared remarks. Look, the conversation should not be about growth, it should be that if we remain range bound around $35 a barrel, how much and how fast do you cut capital and volume decline.\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: And on top of that, what's been lost is, what is the rate of return of that program? I think Travis said that, and are you breaking even? Or are you actually returning cash? And I look forward to other companies answering that question in this commodity price environment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Singer: I wanted to follow-up on the topic of decline rates. It's come up a couple of times on the call, but I wanted to see, especially given that it was brought up as a reason for consolidation by another company. How you see your decline rates this year and in the maintenance capital plan next year on an oil and BOE basis, and your confidence in ability to execute a free cash capital returns model from the perspective of a Permian pure play?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, Brian, it's a very good question. It's very topical, right? And I think companies have reasons for why they do things. I'm only going to speak about Diamondback. And I know that slowing down as much as we have is reducing our base decline. Our base decline is going to go down from high $30s oil to mid-30s oil in 2021. BOE is slightly below that. But a really smart investor told me, as long as you're running the treadmill at the right pace and generating free cash above that capital, this business model can work. And as long as we're setting that target and making sure that we're not moving activity levels up, down all around consistently and consistently generating free cash. I think people are going to pay attention to that and prove that you can return capital and generate sufficient returns to be successful in U.S. shale.\nTravis Stice: It's just really difficult to look at an acquisition or a merger and try to justify it on decline rate. And I get the math behind that. But I think Kaes articulated the way we think about decline rates, but it's unlikely with -- I'll stop there.\nBrian Singer: And then my follow-up is also a little bit on the M&A discussion, but more from a diamondback look back perspective, you've done M&A before, Energen. I think about 2 years ago, it closed or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And I wondered, as you look back and you highlighted a little bit some of the benefits from ESPs and some learnings. But how you look within the framework that you set for what makes good M&A to the buyer at the -- and how Energen or the other deals you've done impacted Diamondback today? And then what do you see as the pitfalls that you've learned that maybe you may or may not be applicable for others?\nTravis Stice: Brian, we spent a lot of time post-Energen acquisition to articulate what the synergies were and what our progress was on delivering . And we created the industry's first synergy scorecard so that our investors could hold us accountable on a quarterly basis on how we delivered on those things. And look, we delivered on every one of those things, including becoming investment grade a full year ahead of time, dollar amount. So from the things that we could control, all of these acquisitions have worked out well for us.  Now the oil price assumptions that we made at the time of the acquisitions have those, have those played out? Well certainly not in 2020. Have the development plans been adjusted in some cases because of learnings? Yes, and that means accelerated and decelerated in some cases. But look, at the end of the day, we've got to deliver on what we can control. And I think we've been able to do that, and we're still demonstrating that today.  I think as we've done our look backs and we realized that commodity price moved away from us on some of those things, we have talked about our hedging strategy relative to acquisitions. Should we take a portion of commodity price risk off the table at acquisition time by doing hedges. But other than that, the operational measures, the cost-saving measures, the G&A and LOE reductions, those things have all -- we've delivered on all of those, and you can go back just a couple of quarters and look at our, what we call our synergy scorecard and our accountability towards -- to our shareholders for delivering on those.  And I think, listen, bottom line, Brian, if you can do it, we deliver on it. And if you can't, you come up with all these different kind of excuses. And so we hold ourselves accountable for what we promised to our shareholders, and we'll always do that on a go-forward basis as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc.\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the high grading comment. I think if I wind the clock back a little bit to 2019, you guys have basically said that we will be working in some lower IRR zones into our development plan to make sure those resources were properly captured over time and not left behind. Just wanted to get a sense of your kind of recent comments about high grading indicated that maybe you're moving away from doing some of that in the near term, just given the lower oil price environment that we're in here?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: So, I mean, I think you have to look at that at the margin. I certainly don't think we're a abandoning co-development at all. We do think developing more zones together at the same time, should those zones be economic at today, $40 a barrel, they're going to get developed. Spacing assumptions between zones can change and should widen as commodity prices weaken. But I think the high grading is really more about the consistency and deliverability of Midland Basin rock at low cost. And we were shifting to the Midland Basin before this downturn, but the downturn certainly accelerated it and moved us more to a 2/3, 1/3 or 70-30, Midland Basin, Delaware Basin, than a 55-45 or 60-40.\nLeo Mariani: And I guess just a follow-up on your maintenance CapEx range for next year. You guys are certainly -- seem confident you can execute this at a 25% to 35% lower budget. Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity on what gets you the 25% lower versus the 35% lower? Is it really just about well costs? And obviously, you guys articulated that leading edge well costs have come down quite a bit here recently?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. I think it's well costs and the number of wells completed. We also are -- while we're not thinking about it today, you do need to plan for 2022 in 2021, particularly from a rig count perspective. So looking to keep that guidance live today and narrow it as we finalize our development plan over the next few months.\nOperator: Our next question will come from line Jeffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.\nJeffrey Lambujon: Just one from me on the corporate structure specific to Rattler. Just looking at relative valuation between Diamondback and Rattler? Just curious if there's an opportunity there or any consideration internally to potentially pull that structure in?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. Jeff, we're certainly looking at it. Rattler is a new company in its infancy. And I think this kind of ties to our commentary on M&A. We're not looking to do anything rash at the bottom of the cycle. Certainly, Rattler has gone through a large phase of growth through all of the equity method investments. Those are behind us. The business is generating free cash. It's not getting a lot of credit from the market. But I think we've studied GP LP relationships throughout E&P land very, very closely. And I think for us, we see our LPs as partners and therefore, aren't going to make a rash decision, even though the 2 multiples are trading on top of each other today.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy.\nDavid Amoss: The question I had was, we're thinking about Permian being overpiped and just the gross volumes that you all are producing, clearly, will be 240,000 or somewhere would be our estimate versus your 175,000 commitment. But as a whole, can you just give us what your gross volumes are for the third quarter so we can start thinking through the whole industry as we get into '21?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, David, that's a good question. We're probably in the 220,000 to 230,000 gross range from a production perspective. So not having to take-or-pay commitments, which I think we set up those contracts in a way that half of our pipeline space is take-or-pay and the other half is from the acreage dedication. So trying to avoid cash outflows for take-or-pay commitments and marketing arrangements.  Certainly the Permian is over piped today. I think we see these commitments and our space on the pipelines as long-term insurance policies, and while Brent Midland has gone against us for the last couple of quarters, the volatility in this industry has been dramatic. And there is some phone calls that we could make in March and April to know that our barrels are going to move and exit the water or hit floating storage because of our commitments to those pipelines. So certainly over piped, but I think the legacy pipelines need to reduce their tariffs before ours that we're on, which are the lower tariff pipes in the basin get hit more.\nDavid Amoss: Thinking about sub dollar tariffs, is that reasonable for some of the new recontracting? until we...\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. I think that could be fair. While I'm not -- while we're not involved in that process, certainly, the market will dictate and the market spreads will dictate what new tariffs look like.\nOperator: Last call will come from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: My first question is on the maintenance Capex. My second question is on spacing. For the maintenance Capex, in terms of just trying to understand all the moving pieces here, you've done a really great job at meaningfully reducing well costs year-over-year. And I think I heard you say earlier in the call that maintenance -- or sorry, that midstream on infrastructure CapEx would be down about 50% as well next year. So in terms of the workovers, I think before you mentioned that you reduced the number of workover rigs by as much as 80% at 1 point to respond to prices, and so can you just comment on how workover costs may trend next year at different oil prices? And how are these costs split between CapEx and operating expense?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes, Jeanine, I mean there's a very distinct difference between workover rigs that are used for Opex, which is our traditional ROE and then what we call capital workovers, which is basically converting your ESPs to their final form of lift, which is usually a rod pump. So we do spend a little bit of capital, $0.25 million or so per well that goes to its final form of lift, and that will be part of the 2021 budget. It's never been a big issue for us or a big piece of our budget because we've always completed more wells than 10 years prior and the capital budget continue to expand. But heading into 2021, if you think back 3 years ago, we completed about 300 wells pro forma, and those wells in 2021 are going to move to their final form of lift.\nJeanine Wai: That's very helpful. And my second question is on spacing. In terms of the inventory and development strategy, is there any change to how you're thinking about interlateral or vertical spacing between zones and either the basins going forward? i think I heard you mentioned earlier that spacing should probably widen at lower oil prices, and then we noticed like a slight change in the slide. So we just wanted to check-in?\nKaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. I mean, I think in the Midland Basin, where you have more economic zones that are getting co developed, we're getting smarter about both vertical and horizontal spacing and those spacing assumptions vary versus Howard County versus Northern Martin County versus Midland County. So continuing to refine our development program, I think secondary zones will be spaced wider than primary zones that are the highest rate of return. In the Delaware Basin, it's less of an issue because you have less zones that are economic or comparable that compete for capital today. But in the Delaware -- or in the Midland, we are refining spacing, and while it's not widening significantly, I'd say, secondary zones should get wider as oil prices go lower.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you. It's another milestone made today's election day. And I can't help but be reminded that one of the enduring legacies our founding fathers left us was a system for a peaceful transfer of power. And as pray for our country that we can remain calm in these upcoming days and weeks as we move through this process of electing our next leader.  Thank you, everyone, for listening in today and for the good questions. If you've got any additional questions or follow-ups, just reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thank you, and stay well.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. Diamondback continued with our trend of cost reductions in the third quarter, with LOE and G&A remaining near all-time lows and capital cost per lateral foot continuing to decline to new records. Our drilling and completion operations continued to gain efficiencies and current well costs are now 30% lower than 2019 levels in both the Midland and Delaware Basin. We're also beginning to see the benefits from high grading our development programs since the downturn started in our latest well results and have all of the impact of curtailments from the second quarter in the rearview mirror.  As a result of this high grading and improved capital efficiency, we're on track to meet our fourth quarter average oil production target of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels per day and expect to carry this momentum into 2021 as the baseline for our maintenance capital development plan in 2021. We expect to execute on this capital plan with 25% to 35% less capital than 2020. And this plan implies a reinvestment ratio of about 70% at $40 oil. To be clear, this maintenance capital scenario is currently the base case for our operations through the end of 2021. But if commodity prices weaken further and sustain that weakness for an extended period, we will exhibit capital discipline and industry leadership by cutting capital and activity levels further.  The conversation on industry has moved towards touting reinvestment ratios and corporate breakevens, but has shifted away from answering the question of whether or not an operator's development plan is generating sufficient returns and creating net present value for that company's shareholders. While our 2021 corporate maintenance capital breakeven of low 30s WTI before paying our dividend should be considered best-in-class, that scenario will not happen. If we're operating at or near breakeven we will be spending less than maintenance capital to preserve upside for our shareholders and will instead need to conserve cash flow to pay our dividend and to pay down debt.  Put very simply, our forward capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We will protect our dividend, spend maintenance capital at most and use excess free cash flow to pay down debt. If our expected free cash flow will not cover our dividend, then we will cut capital to ensure our dividend is protected.  The third quarter of 2020 provided a preview of this new operating model as we generated $153 million of consolidated free cash flow in the quarter, most of which was used to reduce consolidated net debt by $137 million.  Looking ahead, we have only one material term debt maturity due in the next 4 years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note by early 2021 to further reduce absolute debt. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until the end of 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due in 2025 that's currently callable providing optionality for future gross debt reduction.  Turning briefly to ESG. Diamondback is committed to environmental stewardship and delivering best-in-class performance and reducing our carbon footprint. While owning and operating assets that are positioned on the low end of the global oil cost of supply curve is most important to our stockholders, we recognize it's also important to own and operate assets that are also positioned on the low end of the greenhouse gas emissions cost of supply curve. Diamondback supports public policies that eliminate routine flaring as long as those policies protect the safety of our operations and consider flaring contributions from all segments of the oil and gas industry.  Upstream and midstream operators must continue to work together to address the flaring issue for our industry. Diamondback has been proactive in reducing our flaring by using our balance sheet to build infrastructure to ensure every development well completed is ready to be connected to each respective midstream gatherer. And we will not flow back a well, if that's not the case.  We've also restructured gathering and processing contracts at our expense by converting contracts from a persona proceeds contract to a fixed fee contract so the gatherer does not have an economic excuse not to take our gas. This puts all of the commodity exposure on us as the operator, but ensures that our gas is not flared. Flaring was responsible for over 50% of Diamondback's Scope 1 emissions in 2019.  With flaring per net BOE produced down 54% year-to-date, our Scope 1 emissions have materially declined this year, demonstrating our commitment to environmental responsibility.  Next, on the topic of industry consolidation and M&A, we believe that consolidation in our sector is necessary as our sector is too fragmented, but that's changed rapidly. Industry consolidation has long been anticipated in U.S. shale and has been touted as an avenue to create scale and improve cost efficiencies. Today, Diamondback is a leader in cost and efficiency. The success of the acquisitions we've executed to date were largely driven by realizing hundreds of millions of dollars of savings through lower costs and higher returns than from the previous operators.  A well drilled in the Permian Basin by Diamondback today will be quicker, less expensive and operated with the lowest cost structure in the business. So we do not need to increase our scale to further reduce our cost structure. We produced 300,000 barrels per day at the lowest cash and capital costs in the industry. We also have an investment-grade balance sheet with a proven access to capital even through this pandemic. There's not a piece of the supply chain that would be better for Diamondback if we were bigger than we are today for midstream contracts to service availability to access to capital. These facts should prove to investors that we have the scale necessary to compete in this industry. Touting and arbitrary numbers such as a level of production our market cap deemed to be relevant in our space is both specious and self-serving. This commentary is only coming from companies with those arbitrary characteristics and is not based in fact or proven through operational metrics.  Diamondback is not getting left behind if we don't do anything today, and we prefer not to make rash decisions at the bottom of the cycle. Patience will be rewarded at the end of the day, and we have the balance sheet, cost structure and asset-based -- asset base to be patient and ride out this downturn as brutal as it may be.  Getting bigger does not always translate to getting better. Better is what should matter to shareholders. and better does not mean that financial metrics are improved in that first year. Better means the acquirer adds inventory that competes for capital right away at a relative value that's accretive to the acquirer shareholders, not the targets. Whether the transaction is an MOE or selling the company or buying something, the transaction must translate to being better for our shareholders who own the company. If that is the case, then that's what we'll do.  To finish, we operate in a cyclical business. And while this downturn has been as severe as any in industry history, Diamondback has the size, scale, balance sheet, asset quality and cost structure to weather a prolonged downturn and thrive in the inevitable upcycle. We are generating and expect to continue to generate free cash flow, and we will allocate that free cash flow to our dividend and debt reduction until commodity prices meaningfully recover from current levels.  With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Well, let me just circle back to -- you reemphasized my point on scale. There's not a single service company that's calling us up and saying, hey, you're not big enough. We're not going to be able to do business with you. I think we've laid out a pretty good case for how you should think about Diamondback in terms of size and scale and balance sheet and execution metrics. But as it pertains to M&A, it's hard for me to forecast M&A. I think you got to go back and just focus on the words that I said, we're going to grow our asset base just like we've always done, only when it -- we can show that we can drive shareholder value. And that has been the same since the -- in October of 2012 when we took the company public, that's what we come in to work for thinking about every day, is how can we drive shareholder value. And if it comes through execution or it comes through M&A, that's what we'll do. Sure. I'm really proud of our operations organization. And particularly, this skill set on gas lift really came through the legacy Energen folks, and it's a tribute to those guys. They showed us how we could accomplish our lift mechanism using gas lift as opposed to what Diamondback's legacy operation practice was with ESPs. Now we still have a lot of ESPs in the ground. But we've been making a fundamental shift in going from ESPs to gas lift, and we're seeing a significant reduction in cost savings.  And at the same time, we're not seeing any detrimental impact on performance, so something we're really excited about. And I mean, if you just step all the way back from it, these ESPs, while it's pretty easy just to crank the wrist up or down in response to volume needs. At the end of the day, you're hanging an electric motor in water, 1.5 mile on the ground with an extension cord, and there's nothing but bad things can happen in that scenario.  So there's still going to be a part of our operating plan, ESPs will be. But we're really excited about some of the leading-edge technologies we're deploying with gas lift. And listen, just on the expense side, our focus has always been to be the lowest cost operating in Permian basin. But we've got an organization that understands that for every $0.01 that we save in costs, whether it's LOE or G&A, that translates to $1 million of cash flow that we can return to shareholders or whatever.  So when you have a mindset that's focused on pennies, from the Boardroom, out to our field organization, that's how you ultimately end up driving best-in-class cost structures, which is what Diamondback consistently delivers on. David, I can tell you from my chair and looking at this kind of 2/3 Midland Basin, 1/3 Delaware or 3/4, 25%, that capital allocation looking out for the next, I don't know, four to six quarters, I'm as confident in our forward plan as I've ever been. I mean we're really fired on all cylinders, on execution, on cost reductions and very confident in this forward plan to be able to deliver what our shareholders expect. David, I just want to circle back on your question of inventory. Kaes articulated that we're only going to burn maybe 150 wells per year on the Midland Basin side of things. That translates to years of future inventory. When I talked about confidence in the next several quarters, that doesn't mean that I'm not confident in the next several years. I'm -- we've got 350,000 acres here in the Permian. And the slower we go, the more towards maintenance capital we and the industry goes. It just extends whatever the perception of inventory life is, that just extends it out because we're just not playing through it at the same pace we were last year when we were running 20-plus rigs. So I hope that clarifies that a little bit. Yes, Neal, listen, that commentary that's out there is just -- it's not based in fact. I mean at the end of the day, Diamondback is -- we're completing these wells as fast as anybody in the basin with 2 pads at the same time with these simul-frac operations. All of our supply chain is tight. We're not at any disadvantage based on size and scale.  And I think some of the commentary is because people are struggling with wider cost structures disconnected from Diamondback's cost structure. And so the commentary navigates towards size and scale because it's difficult to point to why down if I can do it so much cheaper and so much faster. I don't know, I mean, you need to ask the people that are making those comments why they're making those comments because it's certainly, from my shareholders' perspective -- our shareholders' perspective, that's not what we're seeing nor hearing. Well, there's certainly some significant headwinds on the commodity space right now. I mean we've got the election uncertainty and looming policy changes, if there's an administration change. We've got COVID that's still -- we're still struggling to -- how to contain that. And is there going to be a vaccine anytime soon, and what does that mean to the supply demand recovery? We've got OPEC+ meeting in December to talk about whether they maintain cuts or start easing those cuts, and then we've got a global inventory overhang that's still there. All of those are macro issues that I can't control, and we can't influence. But what we can do is continue to focus on the cost structure and how we execute on our development plan, how we demonstrate confidence in our base dividend and how in improving commodity price world, we take advantage of an increasing our shareholder-friendly returns program.  We've already addressed -- we're addressing our debt issue right now. So look, this 2020 -- let's be clear, this has been a global apocalyptic event, not only for citizens at large, but certainly for our industry. And we're at a point now where we feel very confident in the business plan that we have in place. We feel very confident in our ability to execute and consistently deliver on that business plan.  And we also feel like we're enough of an adult in the way that we look at things, if they get worse from here, we'll change our behaviors, and we'll slow down and preserve capital. So there's nothing for me not to confident be in. And there is uncertainty ahead of us in the commodity price world. But I'm confident in the people we have at Diamondback, and I'm confident in the communication we have with our shareholders about what it is we're trying to accomplish.\nKaes Vana\u0302\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. And Nitin, this business is not easy right now. There's no denying that, but that doesn't mean we're going to capitulate at the bottom of the cycle. I think Travis said it in his prepared remarks that we're not going to make a rash decision at the bottom of the cycle. And anything that happens, means you have to get better, not necessarily bigger, to ride out of storm. This is not an easy business. We have plenty of our production hedged on the downside in 2021 and as Travis said, if things get worse, we'll have to make the tough decisions like we have already in 2020. Look, Nitin, just one other point. At the bottom of the cycle, which I don't know if we're completely at the bottom of the cycle now. But even as bad as things have been in 2020, Diamondback is still a profitable company. We generated $153 million worth of free cash flow in the third quarter. We're paying our base dividend, which is yielding above the S&P 500, and we're reducing debt at the bottom of this cycle. And so if we can accomplish all of those things at the bottom of the cycle, think about what the world is going to look like for our shareholders as we start coming out of the other side of the cycle, which we know is inevitable, and we know that oil price will increase in the future. We just don't know when. But if we're profitable like this at the very bottom of the cycle. And that -- we're on the other side. We're good. Derrick, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments Kaes made about those permanent cost savings, 50% of Delaware and 1/3 in the Midland Basin. You shouldn't lose sight of the point that those are structural cost improvements on -- and operated. It's already the lowest or the best-in-class in those execution measures. So it's not a casual exercise from our operations organization to continue when they're already leading to drive costs out, but I'm just really proud of what they've been able to accomplish. Yes. I think as a general statement, Asit, American energy producers, we've got an important role in meeting the challenge of global climate change. We believe that climate policy has got to facilitate meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions, but it's also, at the same time, got to balance economic, environmental and energy security needs. And we've got to promote innovation solutions to this climate challenge. As Kaes highlighted, this year, we adopted emissions targets. And as part of our executive compensation plan. And we also -- uniquely, all of our employees, 737 employees of Diamondback, they share in that same bonus plan.  So those environmental measures are part of their cash bonus. So -- and I'd also tell you, while we've not finalized incentive comp for 2021, emissions targets are going to continue to be included in our comp plans, and we're likely to set multiyear emissions reduction targets. And listen, I hope all the industry -- I hope all of the energy producers can kind of take this as a challenge to step forth and take a stand on what it is that we're trying to accomplish.  We have an environmental and the social license to operate in the areas we live and work, and Diamondback's trying to -- we're trying to stand up and take a leadership position in that. And again, just back to that scale comment, we're doing this -- don't have to be big to do this. We're doing it. We're doing it at our current scale. So getting big to accomplish to accomplish environmental goals, again, we've proven that that's not the case. I think if you look at our flaring from this time a year ago, even year-to-date, we're down 50-some-odd percent. From this time a year ago, we're down almost 75%. So we've done what we needed to do, and we'll continue to lean into that until we've eliminated all routine flaring. And we expect that to be sooner rather than later as long as we can work collaboratively with our midstream providers. Sure. There's a couple of things. I mean, pick your energy expert forecaster. I mean the world is going to continue to need energy from liquid hydrocarbons for many, many years to come. And our population is continuing to grow. We understand that there's going to be the world that's striving for energy transition. But in the near term, supply and demand is going to rebalance. And when it does, that's going to lead to the inevitable rise in commodity price. I don't know when that's going to occur. But I think it's probably going to occur sooner rather than later. But we're positioned to -- like I said, weather this storm, as brutal as it's been. We'll continue to do what's the best thing for our shareholders. But I am constructive on commodity price long-term because of the supply demand fundamentals. I'll tell you, Scott, the other kind of knock-on effect of that is that the modeling that we have to do, which is -- has gotten more and more complex over the years is what we call the water out effect. But because we're completing these wells so much faster, almost twice as fast, that water out effect has really been positively impacted in terms of its length and duration and its overall impact because we're getting on and off these wells so much faster. Not something we really contemplated when we started simul-frac, but we've seen the benefits of that now. Yes, that's a good -- that was the reason I made that point earlier was the fact that our yield is already, what, at over 5%. So I'll just tell you that our Board is committed to that dividend is the primary form of our shareholder return program. And we talk about it at least every quarter, if not more frequently than that. But I've been -- I've tried to be very clear what our strategy is right now, it's to pay that base dividend at -- right now, it's above an S&P 500 yield and reduce debt. And as commodity price rises, well then we have options to do things with excess free cash flow above the dividend and debt reduction.\nKaes Vana\u0302\u0080\u0099t Hof: Yes. And Jeff, I think it's important to look back at earlier this year and the conviction it took to maintain that dividend through the down cycle or the worst of the down cycle. That was not an easy decision, particularly after we doubled the dividend in February. So I keep hearing about forward return of capital and what people are going to do. I think looking at our history and what we've leaned into in order to maintain that dividend, while others have either suspended theirs, cut it or even sold their companies should be reviewed by our shareholders. And I think the more germane question should be asked if those operators that are touting this future 2022 and beyond return to shareholders. I think the more important question should be, how does that look at a $36 world as opposed to what we're going to do when oil is $55 a barrel. Yes. Just generally, I think you're raising the right question. The right question should be, what kind of returns are you generating on your capital program? If it's maintenance capital, what kind of returns do you generate in a $35, $36 a barrel. And if the answer is little to no returns to our investors, then why would you even keep volumes flat? That's what I tried to raise -- I tried to read that point in my prepared remarks. Look, the conversation should not be about growth, it should be that if we remain range bound around $35 a barrel, how much and how fast do you cut capital and volume decline.\nKaes Vana\u0302\u0080\u0099t Hof: And on top of that, what's been lost is, what is the rate of return of that program? I think Travis said that, and are you breaking even? Or are you actually returning cash? And I look forward to other companies answering that question in this commodity price environment. It's just really difficult to look at an acquisition or a merger and try to justify it on decline rate. And I get the math behind that. But I think Kaes articulated the way we think about decline rates, but it's unlikely with -- I'll stop there. Brian, we spent a lot of time post-Energen acquisition to articulate what the synergies were and what our progress was on delivering . And we created the industry's first synergy scorecard so that our investors could hold us accountable on a quarterly basis on how we delivered on those things. And look, we delivered on every one of those things, including becoming investment grade a full year ahead of time, dollar amount. So from the things that we could control, all of these acquisitions have worked out well for us.  Now the oil price assumptions that we made at the time of the acquisitions have those, have those played out? Well certainly not in 2020. Have the development plans been adjusted in some cases because of learnings? Yes, and that means accelerated and decelerated in some cases. But look, at the end of the day, we've got to deliver on what we can control. And I think we've been able to do that, and we're still demonstrating that today.  I think as we've done our look backs and we realized that commodity price moved away from us on some of those things, we have talked about our hedging strategy relative to acquisitions. Should we take a portion of commodity price risk off the table at acquisition time by doing hedges. But other than that, the operational measures, the cost-saving measures, the G&A and LOE reductions, those things have all -- we've delivered on all of those, and you can go back just a couple of quarters and look at our, what we call our synergy scorecard and our accountability towards -- to our shareholders for delivering on those.  And I think, listen, bottom line, Brian, if you can do it, we deliver on it. And if you can't, you come up with all these different kind of excuses. And so we hold ourselves accountable for what we promised to our shareholders, and we'll always do that on a go-forward basis as well. Thank you. It's another milestone made today's election day. And I can't help but be reminded that one of the enduring legacies our founding fathers left us was a system for a peaceful transfer of power. And as pray for our country that we can remain calm in these upcoming days and weeks as we move through this process of electing our next leader.  Thank you, everyone, for listening in today and for the good questions. If you've got any additional questions or follow-ups, just reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thank you, and stay well."

All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's second quarter 2020 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on our website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found on our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute to continue to extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those both directly and indirectly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This year has brought unprecedented challenges and I'm proud of how our organization responded given the obstacles presented. Our teams reacted quickly to the commodity price volatility and adjusted our operating and capital plans in real time. We are seeing the benefits of this work today with all-time low cash operating costs and capital costs per lateral foot at or below all-time lows in both basins. This is also accompanied by high-graded forward development plan weighted towards the mid-LAN basin where we have high mineral ownership, low midstream and infrastructure capital requirements, and high returns due to the quality of our acreage accompanied by industry low drilling and completion costs. Turning to the second quarter, we dramatically reduced our operated rig count in the second quarter, from 20 rigs on March 31st to six rigs today. In response to historically low commodity prices experienced in the quarter, we made the decision to complete as few wells as possible in the second quarter, with zero wells turned to production in the month of June. We also curtailed 5% of our oil production during the second quarter. This curtailed production has been restored, and is now receiving significantly higher realized prices than it would have received when the decision was made to curtail. We have three completion crews working today to stem production declines and to meet our fourth quarter production target of between 170 and 175,000 barrels of oil per day. Importantly, Diamondback decreased activity levels throughout the second quarter while not spending excessive dollars on early termination fees or other one-time expenses that are headwinds to cash generation. Looking ahead, production is expected to continue to decline in the third quarter, but rise to meet our fourth quarter guidance as we began completion operations in June with two crews and added a third completion crew in July. We expect to run between three and four completion crews for the rest of the year and are currently running six operated drilling rigs which is our base case for the rest of the year. In 2021, should a maintenance capital scenario become the base case, Diamondback can hold fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat, while spending 25% to 35% less than 2020's capital budget, which is also expected to include lower midstream and infrastructure budgets. The second half of 2020 and 2021's capital programs will benefit from the drawdown of some of the DUC build from the first half of 2020 as we worked down our operated rig counts as contracts rolled off. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion of standalone liquidity and have only $191 million of our September 2021 notes outstanding after tendering for 55% of the original $400 million issuance during the second quarter. This was our only major term debt maturity before 2024. With our reduction in forward capital spending, and expectation for true free cash flow generation at current commodity prices in the second half of 2020 and 2021, we will look to reduce both gross and net debt while continuing to return capital to our shareholders through our base dividend. This dividend remains our primary return of capital to our equity holders and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividend based on the current forward outlook. To finish, Diamondback has further adjusted downward our already low cost structure and is prepared to operate successfully in a lower-for-longer oil price environment. A lot of the efficiency and cost gains made during this downturn will become permanent and will benefit Diamondback shareholders in a recovery. Low interest expense, low leverage, industry-leading, low cash operating cost, downside hedge protection, strong midstream contracts, and the benefits of Viper and Rattler will allow Diamondback to operate effectively through an uncertain forward outlook. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Neal Dingmann from [indiscernible]. Your line is now live. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: First question. Travis, for your case, I guess, we've heard a lot this year about how activity and pricing has impacted everybody's free cash flow. But, again, what we've noticed for you all, and you mentioned this in the press release several times that your costs have come down notably again in 2Q. So, my question is how your cost control sets you up for free cash flow generation better as it appears to me your outspend is now behind you all.\nTravis Stice: Certainly, I agree the outspend is behind us. As I articulated the third quarter, fourth quarter, and throughout next year, we'll be generating significant free cash flow. The cost structure remains one of Diamondback's significant advantages. You've heard me say before that our main focus is to convert resource into cash flow at the most efficient margin while we drill and complete really good wells. The cost savings and the cost reductions that we're seeing right now through this downturn, we believe that a high percentage of those will continue throughout the forward development plan. Historically, when you go through a cycle, you'll see service cost concessions of 10% to 15%. We're now down over 25% over the last 12 months. As long as rig count stays below 200 rigs out here in the Permian and commodity price stays sort of range bound where it is right now, we feel pretty confident that the execution and cost metrics that we're seeing today will be part of our future operating plan.\nNeal Dingmann: Leads me to the second one just on that plan, I was wondering, on the future activity cadence and leverage, specifically you guys have now mentioned a couple times that you can keep '21 activity flattish with, I think you've said now, 25% less cost. So, the question would be, if prices stay about at today\u2019s level into next year or maybe even go a little bit higher, would you still potentially keep activity levels flattish and cut debt or how would you think about it? Certainly, it sounds like you have the ability with these costs to come in a little bit better. So, I'm just wondering if prices do rally a little bit, as all others seem to be cutting productions out there. What's the thought of tackling debt or looking a little bit more at activity?\nTravis Stice: Certainly, we're not seeing any signals that growth is needed from Diamondback or from our industry in general. So, growth in today's world is pretty much off the table. The comments I made in my prepared remarks echoing the board's viewpoint that we're going to - our primary form of return to our shareholders is in the form of our dividend, and our board's committed to maintaining that dividend, and hopefully growing that into the future as well. Beyond that, excess free cash flow, as I said, we\u2019ll be using to reduce debt. So, I think it's a combination of both continue to lean into the dividend and also reduce total debt and net debt at the same time.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neal, I think we're really focused on this Q4 exit rate number on an oil of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels a day and maintaining that number in 2021 with the lowest capital required, whether that\u2019s on the midstream side, the infrastructure side, as well as the DC&E side. So, we're continuing to refine that and put some guideposts around 2021. But as Travis said, growth isn't top of mind today; instead, it's how capital efficient can we be to keep that production flat in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nDerrick Whitfield: I wanted to follow-up on Neal's first question. Perhaps for yourself, Travis, or Danny. Could you speak to the repeatability of your recent operational records with the completion of the Spanish Trail four-wall pad 10.5 days and the horizontal well you drilled in 8,000-foot in 24 hours? And if possible, help us kind of quantify the savings associated with that degree of efficiency versus your average well. And, Travis, we understand that every well can't be a pacesetter well, but we're just trying to get a feel for the degree of cost savings and how repeatable that could be for you guys in the future.\nTravis Stice: Yes, Derrick, Danny is in the room this morning and I\u2019m going to let Danny answer those specifics.\nDaniel Wesson: Yes. First, on the kind of repeatability point on the completion side, I mean, really, that's a kind of an operational procedural change from one of our service providers and a new kind of way of attacking zipper completion. So, that's repeatable on each pad we go to that we have those simultrack crews rigged up on. It's certainly something we anticipate going forward. And then as far as on the drilling side, the 8,000-foot in 24 hours, while that's a leading-edge kind of metric and it's a basin record and a Diamondback record, I don't expect us to be beating records on every well that we drill, but certainly, we'll keep edging closer to those types of results. And while that's the leading edge marker, maybe the midpoint moves closer to that and as we continue to utilize the technology that our partners are bringing us and start pushing the bounds of what we can do.\nTravis Stice: And then I think, Derrick, on the cost side, the completion crew that completes two wells at once and can - did that Spanish trail pad, you\u2019re paying more for the horsepower, but you're also saving a lot of money on the variable costs. So, you're probably saving somewhere in the range of $20 or $25 a foot. And I think tangentially, that benefits areas where you have high water out or high production. You're watering out your production for a lot shorter period of time and getting that production back online. So, that's a crew that we're going to use in areas where we have a lot of existing production throughout the basin.\nDerrick Whitfield: As my second question, I'd like to shift to the evolving regulatory environment. Perhaps for you, Travis. You've correctly outlined your minimal exposures to federal land as a potential competitive advantage in the event there is non-supportive legislation with permits and/or fracking. With the understanding that you guys are one of the more progressive E&P companies on ESG matters and are not exposed to federal lands, could you speak to your greatest regulatory concerns in the current environment?\nTravis Stice: Yes, sure, Derrick. It's a lot of - we don't have a lot of clarity on what this - what the regulatory environment is going to look like if we fast forward to an administration change. But what we do know is that it won't speed up. Things won't become more efficient. And so, what we're trying to do is be as much on our front foot on things that require regulatory approval. Now, you've just echoed, and we have articulated, that our - we have essentially no exposure to federal acreage, but we're going to see what the new rules of engagement are, should they get rolled out. And you can expect Diamondback like you said to be progressive in the way that we navigate through those new rules of engagement. Listen, we support sound science that drives regulation. And you've heard me say that before in our sustainability report. And we'll continue to support regulation that's backed by sound science. When those two things deviate is where Diamondback and our industry are likely going to have a problem with the regulation.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. You all in your presentation, on pages I guess 10 and 11, provide your current inventory. And you do have that economic sensitivity. And it looks like the Midland Basin is pretty resilient in this assessment, down to at least $40 to $45 a barrel. Could you give us some sense of what causes that resiliency? Is it the current well costs and maybe if you can give a little bit of color around that inventory, where you think that relative, I guess I'll call quality is, versus what you've drilled to date and maybe versus what you see with - compared to other peers?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Scott. I think it's misunderstood how good our Midland Basin inventory is. I'd kind of put our Midland Basin inventory particularly with our cost structure, up against anybody. And that's just proven based on the numbers. So, with current well costs below $600 a foot on the Midland Basin side, we have a significant runway of quality inventory ahead of us. I think we wanted to get ahead of that discussion topic, which seems to poke its head out once in a while. So really, on the Midland Basin side, putting zero dollars of value on the gas side at $35 a barrel, you have over 3,000 locations economic today. And I think that that speaks to the quality of inventory and the cost structure behind that inventory.\nScott Hanold: Yes. And I guess my specific question would be - and you talked about well costs and you obviously have a royalty rate advantage, but can you talk maybe about the like EUR and productivity, say relative to say some of your peers? Or is it really the cost and the royalty advantage?\nKaes Van't Hof: It's really a combination. Some of our peers, mostly the peers that are larger than us that have a significant amount of inventory, they're spacing their wells wider and doing bigger frac jobs, so they're getting a little more EUR per foot, but the costs are higher. We've tended to space our wells relatively tighter at eight wells across, 660-foot spacing in the Midland Basin, and that's partially due to the completion design being a little bit smaller frac job, but also the costs being lower, and therefore getting a little lower EUR per foot, but from a returns perspective, you\u2019re drilling and completing those wells for multiple hundred dollars per foot cheaper.\nScott Hanold: And then my follow-up question is on the conversation of maintenance spending into next year. How many wells does it take to maintain your production? And to maintain that 170 to 175 on the oil side, would your oil cuts stay flat? I mean, what does your oil cut do through like 2021 on a maintenance plan?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think oil cut comes up a little bit from where it was in the second quarter because of the curtailments, but we're probably still somewhere in the low-60s now. Our maintenance plan in 2021 is moving more and more towards the Midland Basin. So, that probably means a few more wells than if you were 50/50 Midland Delaware. But I think something similar to our gross operated well count this year with two-thirds or more focused on the Midland Basin is kind of where our head is at. And I think, as we're doing our work right now to refine that analysis and refine that 25% to 35% less capital number, we'll update the market when we have that data.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nGail Nicholson: You guys have had a nice improvement in LOE. Can you just talk about how you think LOE trends physically in the back half of 2020, and then more importantly in 2021 and what drivers you have done to gain that further improvement?\nTravis Stice: Yes, Gail, really, credit to the team and the field organization who went from ramping up in April to curtailing in May and bringing back that curtailed production in June to keep LOE as low as it did in the second quarter, below $4. I think that, naturally, that number is going to come up a little bit in Q3 and Q4. But still probably be somewhere in the lower half of the force. Then, as we think about the next year, our large capital spend on the infrastructure side in terms of electrification of some fields as well as going to gas foot projects will help LOE stay in that kind of low 4's range as we head into 2021. And every cent at current production is about $1 million a year of cash flow. So, we're picking up pennies and going to stay focused on being as close to that $4 bogie as we can.\nGail Nicholson: And then, in \u201821, your take-or-pay obligations or firm sales increased with the start-up of Wink to Webster. I was just kind of curious how you guys are thinking about price realization expectations in '21 per percent of WTI and the importance of having that exposure to Brent as we move forward in time?\nTravis Stice: I think the exposure to Brent stays about the same 2020 to 2021, about 60%. But once Wink to Webster comes on, that contract moves from a Midland-based price to MEH-based price. I think our mentality there, the thought process is these types of commitments and the long-term sales agreements are essentially large insurance policies for when things go bad. And right now, with Brent WTI as narrow as it is, we're probably losing a few cents versus selling those barrels in Midland. But if Brent WTI blows out to $4 or $5 a barrel, then we're probably receiving somewhere close to 100% of WTI.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line Asit Sen from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nAsit Sen: The DUC count of 110 to 140 at year end \u201820 and you talked about drawing those, what's a good way to think about a normal DUC level in this scenario? And if you could - I know it's a little early, if I'm thinking about maintenance capital in 2022 at current strip, how should we conceptually think about Midland, Delaware split and capital needs for infrastructure?\nTravis Stice: I'll take the second part first, Asit. I think, overall, infrastructure is - the line that we define as infrastructure will be cut almost in half going into 2021 and I think that number, we've had a large infrastructure build across our position over the last three or four years and there's a lot of scrutiny on that number to not come back up. As we have executed on our one-time projects on electrification and gas lift, and we have very few new batteries to build, instead we expand our existing batteries, that infrastructure budget is going to keep being driven down. Even in 2022, that's a long way from today. But I think our goal is to try to be at least two thirds Midland Basin-weighted for the foreseeable future. And whether that's in a growth or a stay-flat scenario, I think we have the inventory to do that.\nAsit Sen: And then my follow-up question is on the ESU front. Travis, you emphasized the ESG, and on slide 20 flaring as a percent of net production has come down pretty nicely year-over-year. Could you talk about strategies enabling this? Again, remind us on the compensation metrics as it relates to ESG?\nTravis Stice: Yes, specifically, our field organization and operations organization jumped ahead and took advantage of some of the slowdown in our drilling activity to kind of get caught up on some of the Diamondback-required drilling and completion operations, particularly in the Delaware Basin. In some instances, we brought our balance sheet to bear, where we spent dollars to eliminate flaring, but it's essentially across the board a high emphasis to not flare at all. And we do need, at times, help from our gathering partners to make sure that once we're hooked up that that can move the gas. But in general, we've adopted a policy of every well is connected to a gas sales point before it's brought on. And that, plus working closely with our gathering and processing partners, has allowed us to really substantially reduce our flaring.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, and, also, we haven't taken the matter into our own hands by converting some of these legacy contracts that we had from POP, percent of proceeds, over the 100% fixed fee. And that's what's driving our gathering and transportation costs going up by a little bit this quarter. Now, we catch the benefit of that on the realized price side on the gas front, so it's really a neutral trade. And the higher gas goes up, the more we're exposed to that on the Diamondback side. So, using the legal and the contract route to incentivize our gatherers and processors on a fixed fee basis to take our gas.\nTravis Stice: And we've got - in fact, you can read it on Slide 21, some of the changes we made to our short-term incentive compensation program. And as a reminder, this scorecard, this corporate scorecard that we present in our proxy, that makes up half of every employees' short-term incentive compensation on an annual basis. So, we've got a 15% weighting on our ES&G measures. And you can see what those are on Slide 21. Listed there, safety metrics, our flaring, greenhouse gas emissions, the percent of recycled water, oil spill control and TRIR or total recordable incident rate. There's five measures that make up that ES&G score now.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Grampp of Northland Securities. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nJeff Grampp: You guys have communicated pretty clearly, an aspiration to reduce debt here on an absolute relative basis over the next few quarters. So, I was wondering if you guys had targeted either an absolute or relative level on the debt side that you guys would want to get to before assessing and increasing returns to shareholders.\nTravis Stice: Jeff, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. We've raised our dividend every year since putting it in place three years ago and I think that being the primary return of capital, we're going to look at that very closely at the end of the year and see what 2021 holds on that front. The one consistent theme we received from our largest shareholders over the past few months is to protect the dividend and in exchange for protecting that dividend, cut capital. And that's what I think we're going do. I think overall, we would like our debt to be lower than higher. And I don't want to put out a two year or five-year target on that front because a lot can change in this business, as you've seen in the last three months. But I do want to also emphasize that at the parent company, we still have three companies right? And each of those companies has debt that's manageable. All three companies will be generating free cash flow starting in the third quarter going forward. And on top of that, Diamondback has a lot of ownership in those two subsidiaries which while you can't sell all that in a day, at some point that is a safety valve for how much debt you think you have at the parent company.\nJeff Grampp: My follow-up, Travis, wanted to pick your brain on the M&A front, maybe from a couple angles. First, just generally, your comfort level at taking a serious look at any deals in this environment? And second is just any level of interest in terms of diversifying the asset base outside of the Permian? Do you see benefits to that from Diamondback's perspective? Or do you think it's more of a competitive advantage to have the concentration and the knowledge space that you have in the Permian?\nTravis Stice: Look, in terms of the first part of your question, M&A, we are so internally focused right now on doing the things that we need to do. Look, our industry's been rightly criticized for all kinds of noise that have distracted from returns and our focus right now is singularly trying to deliver the highest returns and cash flow for every single dollar we invest. And look, from the public guys, the debt's trading so poorly for the public guys that could potentially be targets, it just doesn't make any sense for us right now. So, that's kind of my view on M&A. And then, I just don't think that it makes sense for Diamondback to be looking at other basins. One of the core philosophies we talk about here is know what you're good at. And Diamondback is really, really good at Permian Basin extraction of hydrocarbons. And that's borne out by our cost structure and our execution metrics. And that's our - that\u2019s our emphasis. That's what we're good at; that's what we know we're good at and that's what we're going to maintain.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of [indiscernible] from JPMorgan. Your line is now live; go ahead, please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Travis, your guidance implies a - call it a 60/40 split in footage between the Midland Delaware Basins this year. I was wondering if you could give us maybe some more thoughts on how that mix could look as we head into the back half of the year and perhaps any preliminary thoughts on 2021.\nTravis Stice: Sure. I'm going to let Kaes answer that. He's got a spreadsheet in front of him.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. The 60/40 really is driven by a lot of the first half of the year being in the Delaware Basin. And looking to back half of the year, Q3, Q4 and into 2021, we\u2019ve really moved the rig schedule on the frac schedule to about 70/30 Midland Delaware. While I don't have my spreadsheet in front of me, that's kind of the path forward is let's get more focused on the Midland Basin where we have less infrastructure needs, less midstream needs, lower LOE, and probably better returns in our overall cost structure. So, I think for us, six rigs operating, four of them are in the Midland and two in the Delaware.\nUnidentified Analyst: And, Kaes, if you were going to characterize what the spread and call it and oil breakeven is today, kind of using some of your leading-edge well cost, what would you say the spread is?\nKaes Van't Hof: I'd say it's less than $5, but somewhere around $5 a barrel. Your breakeven in the Midland a little bit lower than the Delaware. I just think if you're running $5.75 or $5.80 as your cost per lateral foot, that's a pretty good return in project with some of these Midland Basin wells in the 80, 90, 100 barrels a foot EUR range.\nUnidentified Analyst: And just my follow-up, quite a few of incoming questions just on next year's CapEx thoughts. Obviously, you released this a couple - two, three weeks ago, but just the 25% to 35% of decline per year to keep 4Q oil flat, you did highlight some lower infrastructure costs, but what type of well cost is kind of embedded within that range? Are you using basically the 2020 updated outlook for well costs? But maybe just a little bit of color on that would be helpful.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I don't think we would use the 2020 updated outlook, the real-time cost to drive that number. We're really kind of using the lower end of our full-year 2020 guidance range. We - I think Travis mentioned earlier in the call, well costs are down 25% year-over-year, probably 50% of that is service-cost related. I think for us to guide to all-time low well costs in 2021 would not be a prudent idea.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nJeanine Wai: My first question is following up on some of the prior ones on productivity and activity allocation. Can you tell us how you anticipate the corporate-wide productivity per foot to trend in 2021 relative to 2020? And I guess we're asking because I know that there's been some change recently and there's some preference between high-grading zones in a more modest price environment versus more co-development versus kind of needs retention.\nTravis Stice: Well, I think, Jeanine, overall, with more Midland Basin as a higher percentage of your total capital, your Midland Basin EUR per foot is lower than the Delaware, but your well costs are significantly lower. So, while I can't give you an exact productivity on well EUR per foot, I do think, in general, the couple hundred wells we\u2019re going to complete in 2021 will be a higher productivity on returns basis than 2020 because in 2020 we were heading into the year to complete 350 wells and we've - we've slowed that machine down to complete 185 this year and something close to that next year. And I think just, in general, our next if 80, 85 wells I see on the schedule for the second half of 2020 are significantly better than the first half of 2020, and we expect that level of detail on drilling our best stuff first to carry into 2021.\nJeanine Wai: My second question is just back on CapEx. I know you pre-released the updated production and CapEx guide. Last night, you provided the helpful breakout between the different components, which were kind of reset to the higher end. Not to rehash old news or anything like that, but I still think that there's a lot of questions on some of the moving pieces on that 2020 update. Especially on the D&C side, given you're completing the same amount of net wells you previously planned and exiting with some less DUCs. Maybe color there for some clarification would be helpful. Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Sure Jeanine. I think what's unique about how Diamondback reports CapEx is that it's a number that actually matches the cash flow statement. And sometimes that's been to our detriment, particularly in the first half of the year. So, in general, we came into the year running 23 rigs and eight completion crews and we're going to exit the year running five or six rigs and three or four completion crews. And that results in a net cash outflow and a cash drag of $250 or $300 million on the budget. I think for others who report a crude CapEx that doesn't match their cash flow statement, we, on an activity-based basis, are going to do 155 to 16 of capital this year with a large cash outflow drag heading into next year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBank. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nLeo Mariani: Want to follow-up a little bit on the cost side. Certainly, looking at your leading edge well costs that you guys are talking about in your slide deck in both the Midland and Delaware, certainly those appear to be below your 2020 guidance in terms of costs per foot. Just trying to get a sense there, do you think kind of the full year \u201820 Midland and Delaware DC&E well cost per foot guide might end up being a little bit conservative, or are you kind of maybe being a little reluctant to change things sort of mid-year here?\nTravis Stice: I think we're reluctant to change it just because half the year's gone, and the way we report CapEx, probably three quarters of the year is essentially gone on well-cost perspective. But these lower well costs that we're seeing today in real time will benefit the company in the fourth quarter and into 2021. So, I think it's prudent for us not to change that guidance. But certainly, we expect the trend to continue.\nLeo Mariani: And I guess, clearly, you guys are very focused, it seems to be, on maintenance mode in a $40 oil world and rightfully so. Travis, you certainly talked about not having the right signals in this current environment to really indicate for anyone in the industry to pursue production growth. I guess, what do you think the right signals might be for the FANG and U.S. industry in general to start thinking about production growth?\nTravis Stice: You've got to have a lot higher commodity price. I don't know what higher means, but certainly materially higher than what you see today. You also have to have access to capital, which right now's been - there's been capital starvation for a number of quarters for our industry. And rightfully so, as I mentioned earlier, because of our industry's inability to generate through returns but the last part of that would be - certainly, investor sentiment would have to change dramatically from where it sits today. There's quite a bet of headwinds, I think, for our industry as you look ahead to try to think about any kind of meaningful production growth.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Travis, Kaes, and the whole team there. I wanted to ask, Travis, this goes back to a comment you made earlier in response to one of your earlier questions about the rig count staying under 200 in service costs. If we go back to the end of last week, a couple of the bigger operators out there, two majors, I think everyone expected them to be dropping rigs, but they really indicated that they're going to be dropping quickly or dropping a lot of rigs into your end. And I'm curious, as you look toward the back half of \u201820 and into \u201821, as that rig count continues to go down, how do you see things changing for you as an operator? Or maybe just in your environment in the greater ecosystem out there?\nTravis Stice: Well, certainly if we continue to have this environment, as I mentioned earlier, well costs are usually going to stay the same or they're going to go lower. And I think it's reasonable, if commodity prices increase, you'll start to see the service sector - the service sector responds. But look, the Permian Basin is going through a seismic shift in a capital allocation from all the operators, and you can see it in the production responses. We're now below 4 million barrels of oil a day of production. And so, it's just hard to see, in this environment, any meaningful change in the current operating situation that all the companies are faced with here in the Permian.\nCharles Meade: Got it, that's it from me. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Yes and Charles, just to add to that though, with this continued reduction in activity, and even in this environment. I can't emphasize enough that Diamondback's clear advantage is not only the number of locations we have that we laid out in our slides in terms of inventory, but it's our cost structure. And so, and - the lower the price of the commodity goes and the more the margins get squeezed, the more really efficient, high-margin companies get highlighted. And certainly Diamondback, as evidenced by numbers in this release, falls into that category.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live sir. Go ahead, please.\nBrian Singer: Can you talk to how this year and the run-up to this year have changed your views, if at all, longer term on the oil price on the right amount of production to hedge? And then, if we are in a lower Diamondback plus industry growth environment in the Permian, the strategic value of your interests in Viper and Rattler?\nTravis Stice: Brian, the - Kaes mentioned earlier about how Diamondback has a large ownership position in both our subs, and that continues to literally and figuratively pay dividends to Diamondback shareholders. And it's something the Diamondback board is aware of, but it's - we're comfortable in our position in our ownership of those subs today. You want to add anything to that, Kaes?\nKaes Van't Hof: No, I think on the hedging side, most of our hedges we structured as two-way callers. And so, we had a slide in our deck where we are exposed to the upside here and we have a good amount of 2021 production hedged. We haven't added - much on that front. We've actually restructured and lowered the total exposure in 2021. But overall, I think we\u2019re moving towards a true free cash flow model that distributes a lot of cash to shareholders. Diamondback should emulate what Viper and Rattler have done over the past couple of years, which is distribute a lot of cash back - back to their shareholders, one being Diamondback. But more hedging, I think, is probably in our future and making sure your dividend is protected on the bottom end and you print a bunch of free cash on the top end of those two-way callers.\nBrian Singer: And then my follow-up is what are you seeing from outside operators in the Permian? And if oil prices do rise, do you have a sense if the level of discipline from the onsite operators will be lower or greater than your own?\nTravis Stice: Well, certainly our industry doesn't have a good track record of that discipline. But I believe that there has been a change in sea level in terms of discipline. And I'm confident that all operators, that at least have any awareness of our industry, are going to be very judicious in trying to resume activities that generate production growth.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nMichael Hall: Appreciate the time. I just wanted to do, I guess follow-up on one thing and then also ask I guess, on base declines maybe first on the declines. I'm just curious, as you guys have slowed down a bit here this year. How do you think about the impact of that on the base decline profile as you look at 2021 exiting 2020, entering 2021, relative to how things look exiting 2019 heading into 2020? What's the change in base decline rate there?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes Michael, on the oil side, we released - high 30s was our base decline exiting 2019 going into 2020. I think that probably goes somewhere into the mid-30s. I can't guarantee the low-30s yet, but probably the mid-30s on at least on oil. So, probably 300 bps or 400 bps of benefit, on the BOE side, we were at low 30s, kind of 32, 33 this year, 2019 going into 2020 and that probably goes down in a couple of hundred bps lower into the - near the 30% range.\nMichael Hall: And I guess the follow-up was on the M&A commentary. It seemed like maybe Travis, you were referring to the public space in that commentary. I just wanted to follow-up, is your view that M&A doesn't really make sense? Is that applicable in both public and the private space or is it worth differentiating between the two at this point?\nTravis Stice: Well, it's all about the rock, right. So I mean, if you find good rock, you shouldn't care whether it's public or private. But the problem that we're seeing on the public side is how poorly the debt's trading for public companies. And that adds a significant detriment on acreage valuation. On the private side, there's just not that many opportunities out there truthfully of Tier 1 acreage. We're not going to - there's just not a lot of Tier 1 rock that's out there and that's kind of how we differentiate it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is now live, sir. Go ahead, please.\nRichard Tullis: Kaes, it was mentioned a couple times that the dividend is the primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders. Just wanted to get your thoughts on potentially Diamondback implementing say, a variable dividend that paid out a certain percentage of excess cash flow yearly?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes I mean, Richard my opinion is, I've heard a lot of talk about the variable dividend. And the only variable dividend I've ever seen is at Viper in our space. But for us, the fixed dividend is the priority. And I think in the conversations with our larger shareholders, they want to be running, kind of, a dividend growth model as how they're getting cash back from their investment in Diamondback. And I think overall, it's a good concept, but it's just not a concept that we're focused on right now. We're focused on the base dividend, which in our peer group has the highest yield today. And I think investors\u2019 knowing that's safe is important and knowing that that's going to grow in the future is also important.\nRichard Tullis: Sure. And then just as a follow-up, looking at the base case 2021 budget of around six rigs, maybe for Travis or Danny, do you envision allocation of some level of capital in that scenario to continue testing your acreage, such as going back to the limelight area or other intervals?\nTravis Stice: There might be a little bit in there, Richard but it's going to be as muted as possible. I think given the shocks that the industry's gone through over the last four months just exemplifies how precious capital is. And I think a lot of our landowners have been pretty accommodating through this. And we're going to do what we can to hold acreage, but also to only drill our best stuff with the majority of the capital.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes Richard, we remain singularly focused on delivering the highest returns and cash flow per share for each dollar that's invested. And every capital allocation decision that we make runs through that aperture and we'll be consistent with that on a go forward basis.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to CEO, Mr. Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Stay well.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes, Neal, I think we're really focused on this Q4 exit rate number on an oil of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels a day and maintaining that number in 2021 with the lowest capital required, whether that's on the midstream side, the infrastructure side, as well as the DC&E side. So, we're continuing to refine that and put some guideposts around 2021. But as Travis said, growth isn't top of mind today; instead, it's how capital efficient can we be to keep that production flat in 2021. Yes, Scott. I think it's misunderstood how good our Midland Basin inventory is. I'd kind of put our Midland Basin inventory particularly with our cost structure, up against anybody. And that's just proven based on the numbers. So, with current well costs below $600 a foot on the Midland Basin side, we have a significant runway of quality inventory ahead of us. I think we wanted to get ahead of that discussion topic, which seems to poke its head out once in a while. So really, on the Midland Basin side, putting zero dollars of value on the gas side at $35 a barrel, you have over 3,000 locations economic today. And I think that that speaks to the quality of inventory and the cost structure behind that inventory. It's really a combination. Some of our peers, mostly the peers that are larger than us that have a significant amount of inventory, they're spacing their wells wider and doing bigger frac jobs, so they're getting a little more EUR per foot, but the costs are higher. We've tended to space our wells relatively tighter at eight wells across, 660-foot spacing in the Midland Basin, and that's partially due to the completion design being a little bit smaller frac job, but also the costs being lower, and therefore getting a little lower EUR per foot, but from a returns perspective, you're drilling and completing those wells for multiple hundred dollars per foot cheaper. Yes. I think oil cut comes up a little bit from where it was in the second quarter because of the curtailments, but we're probably still somewhere in the low-60s now. Our maintenance plan in 2021 is moving more and more towards the Midland Basin. So, that probably means a few more wells than if you were 50/50 Midland Delaware. But I think something similar to our gross operated well count this year with two-thirds or more focused on the Midland Basin is kind of where our head is at. And I think, as we're doing our work right now to refine that analysis and refine that 25% to 35% less capital number, we'll update the market when we have that data. Yes, and, also, we haven't taken the matter into our own hands by converting some of these legacy contracts that we had from POP, percent of proceeds, over the 100% fixed fee. And that's what's driving our gathering and transportation costs going up by a little bit this quarter. Now, we catch the benefit of that on the realized price side on the gas front, so it's really a neutral trade. And the higher gas goes up, the more we're exposed to that on the Diamondback side. So, using the legal and the contract route to incentivize our gatherers and processors on a fixed fee basis to take our gas. Yes. The 60/40 really is driven by a lot of the first half of the year being in the Delaware Basin. And looking to back half of the year, Q3, Q4 and into 2021, we've really moved the rig schedule on the frac schedule to about 70/30 Midland Delaware. While I don't have my spreadsheet in front of me, that's kind of the path forward is let's get more focused on the Midland Basin where we have less infrastructure needs, less midstream needs, lower LOE, and probably better returns in our overall cost structure. So, I think for us, six rigs operating, four of them are in the Midland and two in the Delaware. I'd say it's less than $5, but somewhere around $5 a barrel. Your breakeven in the Midland a little bit lower than the Delaware. I just think if you're running $5.75 or $5.80 as your cost per lateral foot, that's a pretty good return in project with some of these Midland Basin wells in the 80, 90, 100 barrels a foot EUR range. Yes, I don't think we would use the 2020 updated outlook, the real-time cost to drive that number. We're really kind of using the lower end of our full-year 2020 guidance range. We - I think Travis mentioned earlier in the call, well costs are down 25% year-over-year, probably 50% of that is service-cost related. I think for us to guide to all-time low well costs in 2021 would not be a prudent idea. Sure Jeanine. I think what's unique about how Diamondback reports CapEx is that it's a number that actually matches the cash flow statement. And sometimes that's been to our detriment, particularly in the first half of the year. So, in general, we came into the year running 23 rigs and eight completion crews and we're going to exit the year running five or six rigs and three or four completion crews. And that results in a net cash outflow and a cash drag of $250 or $300 million on the budget. I think for others who report a crude CapEx that doesn't match their cash flow statement, we, on an activity-based basis, are going to do 155 to 16 of capital this year with a large cash outflow drag heading into next year. No, I think on the hedging side, most of our hedges we structured as two-way callers. And so, we had a slide in our deck where we are exposed to the upside here and we have a good amount of 2021 production hedged. We haven't added - much on that front.

Diamondback should emulate what Viper and Rattler have done over the past couple of years, which is distribute a lot of cash back - back to their shareholders, one being Diamondback. But more hedging, I think, is probably in our future and making sure your dividend is protected on the bottom end and you print a bunch of free cash on the top end of those two-way callers. Yes Michael, on the oil side, we released - high 30s was our base decline exiting 2019 going into 2020. I think that probably goes somewhere into the mid-30s. I can't guarantee the low-30s yet, but probably the mid-30s on at least on oil. So, probably 300 bps or 400 bps of benefit, on the BOE side, we were at low 30s, kind of 32, 33 this year, 2019 going into 2020 and that probably goes down in a couple of hundred bps lower into the - near the 30% range. Yes I mean, Richard my opinion is, I've heard a lot of talk about the variable dividend. And the only variable dividend I've ever seen is at Viper in our space. But for us, the fixed dividend is the priority. And I think in the conversations with our larger shareholders, they want to be running, kind of, a dividend growth model as how they're getting cash back from their investment in Diamondback. And I think overall, it's a good concept, but it's just not a concept that we're focused on right now. We're focused on the base dividend, which in our peer group has the highest yield today. And I think investors' knowing that's safe is important and knowing that that's going to grow in the future is also important. Yes Richard, we remain singularly focused on delivering the highest returns and cash flow per share for each dollar that's invested. And every capital allocation decision that we make runs through that aperture and we'll be consistent with that on a go forward basis."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute to continue to extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those both directly and indirectly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This year has brought unprecedented challenges and I'm proud of how our organization responded given the obstacles presented. Our teams reacted quickly to the commodity price volatility and adjusted our operating and capital plans in real time. We are seeing the benefits of this work today with all-time low cash operating costs and capital costs per lateral foot at or below all-time lows in both basins. This is also accompanied by high-graded forward development plan weighted towards the mid-LAN basin where we have high mineral ownership, low midstream and infrastructure capital requirements, and high returns due to the quality of our acreage accompanied by industry low drilling and completion costs. Turning to the second quarter, we dramatically reduced our operated rig count in the second quarter, from 20 rigs on March 31st to six rigs today. In response to historically low commodity prices experienced in the quarter, we made the decision to complete as few wells as possible in the second quarter, with zero wells turned to production in the month of June. We also curtailed 5% of our oil production during the second quarter. This curtailed production has been restored, and is now receiving significantly higher realized prices than it would have received when the decision was made to curtail. We have three completion crews working today to stem production declines and to meet our fourth quarter production target of between 170 and 175,000 barrels of oil per day. Importantly, Diamondback decreased activity levels throughout the second quarter while not spending excessive dollars on early termination fees or other one-time expenses that are headwinds to cash generation. Looking ahead, production is expected to continue to decline in the third quarter, but rise to meet our fourth quarter guidance as we began completion operations in June with two crews and added a third completion crew in July. We expect to run between three and four completion crews for the rest of the year and are currently running six operated drilling rigs which is our base case for the rest of the year. In 2021, should a maintenance capital scenario become the base case, Diamondback can hold fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat, while spending 25% to 35% less than 2020's capital budget, which is also expected to include lower midstream and infrastructure budgets. The second half of 2020 and 2021's capital programs will benefit from the drawdown of some of the DUC build from the first half of 2020 as we worked down our operated rig counts as contracts rolled off. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion of standalone liquidity and have only $191 million of our September 2021 notes outstanding after tendering for 55% of the original $400 million issuance during the second quarter. This was our only major term debt maturity before 2024. With our reduction in forward capital spending, and expectation for true free cash flow generation at current commodity prices in the second half of 2020 and 2021, we will look to reduce both gross and net debt while continuing to return capital to our shareholders through our base dividend. This dividend remains our primary return of capital to our equity holders and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividend based on the current forward outlook. To finish, Diamondback has further adjusted downward our already low cost structure and is prepared to operate successfully in a lower-for-longer oil price environment. A lot of the efficiency and cost gains made during this downturn will become permanent and will benefit Diamondback shareholders in a recovery. Low interest expense, low leverage, industry-leading, low cash operating cost, downside hedge protection, strong midstream contracts, and the benefits of Viper and Rattler will allow Diamondback to operate effectively through an uncertain forward outlook. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Certainly, I agree the outspend is behind us. As I articulated the third quarter, fourth quarter, and throughout next year, we'll be generating significant free cash flow. The cost structure remains one of Diamondback's significant advantages. You've heard me say before that our main focus is to convert resource into cash flow at the most efficient margin while we drill and complete really good wells. The cost savings and the cost reductions that we're seeing right now through this downturn, we believe that a high percentage of those will continue throughout the forward development plan. Historically, when you go through a cycle, you'll see service cost concessions of 10% to 15%. We're now down over 25% over the last 12 months. As long as rig count stays below 200 rigs out here in the Permian and commodity price stays sort of range bound where it is right now, we feel pretty confident that the execution and cost metrics that we're seeing today will be part of our future operating plan. Certainly, we're not seeing any signals that growth is needed from Diamondback or from our industry in general. So, growth in today's world is pretty much off the table. The comments I made in my prepared remarks echoing the board's viewpoint that we're going to - our primary form of return to our shareholders is in the form of our dividend, and our board's committed to maintaining that dividend, and hopefully growing that into the future as well. Beyond that, excess free cash flow, as I said, we'll be using to reduce debt. So, I think it's a combination of both continue to lean into the dividend and also reduce total debt and net debt at the same time. Yes, Derrick, Danny is in the room this morning and I'm going to let Danny answer those specifics. And then I think, Derrick, on the cost side, the completion crew that completes two wells at once and can - did that Spanish trail pad, you're paying more for the horsepower, but you're also saving a lot of money on the variable costs. So, you're probably saving somewhere in the range of $20 or $25 a foot. And I think tangentially, that benefits areas where you have high water out or high production. You're watering out your production for a lot shorter period of time and getting that production back online. So, that's a crew that we're going to use in areas where we have a lot of existing production throughout the basin. Yes, sure, Derrick. It's a lot of - we don't have a lot of clarity on what this - what the regulatory environment is going to look like if we fast forward to an administration change. But what we do know is that it won't speed up. Things won't become more efficient. And so, what we're trying to do is be as much on our front foot on things that require regulatory approval. Now, you've just echoed, and we have articulated, that our - we have essentially no exposure to federal acreage, but we're going to see what the new rules of engagement are, should they get rolled out. And you can expect Diamondback like you said to be progressive in the way that we navigate through those new rules of engagement. Listen, we support sound science that drives regulation. And you've heard me say that before in our sustainability report. And we'll continue to support regulation that's backed by sound science. When those two things deviate is where Diamondback and our industry are likely going to have a problem with the regulation. Yes, Gail, really, credit to the team and the field organization who went from ramping up in April to curtailing in May and bringing back that curtailed production in June to keep LOE as low as it did in the second quarter, below $4. I think that, naturally, that number is going to come up a little bit in Q3 and Q4. But still probably be somewhere in the lower half of the force. Then, as we think about the next year, our large capital spend on the infrastructure side in terms of electrification of some fields as well as going to gas foot projects will help LOE stay in that kind of low 4's range as we head into 2021. And every cent at current production is about $1 million a year of cash flow. So, we're picking up pennies and going to stay focused on being as close to that $4 bogie as we can. I think the exposure to Brent stays about the same 2020 to 2021, about 60%. But once Wink to Webster comes on, that contract moves from a Midland-based price to MEH-based price. I think our mentality there, the thought process is these types of commitments and the long-term sales agreements are essentially large insurance policies for when things go bad. And right now, with Brent WTI as narrow as it is, we're probably losing a few cents versus selling those barrels in Midland. But if Brent WTI blows out to $4 or $5 a barrel, then we're probably receiving somewhere close to 100% of WTI. I'll take the second part first, Asit. I think, overall, infrastructure is - the line that we define as infrastructure will be cut almost in half going into 2021 and I think that number, we've had a large infrastructure build across our position over the last three or four years and there's a lot of scrutiny on that number to not come back up. As we have executed on our one-time projects on electrification and gas lift, and we have very few new batteries to build, instead we expand our existing batteries, that infrastructure budget is going to keep being driven down. Even in 2022, that's a long way from today. But I think our goal is to try to be at least two thirds Midland Basin-weighted for the foreseeable future. And whether that's in a growth or a stay-flat scenario, I think we have the inventory to do that. Yes, specifically, our field organization and operations organization jumped ahead and took advantage of some of the slowdown in our drilling activity to kind of get caught up on some of the Diamondback-required drilling and completion operations, particularly in the Delaware Basin. In some instances, we brought our balance sheet to bear, where we spent dollars to eliminate flaring, but it's essentially across the board a high emphasis to not flare at all. And we do need, at times, help from our gathering partners to make sure that once we're hooked up that that can move the gas. But in general, we've adopted a policy of every well is connected to a gas sales point before it's brought on. And that, plus working closely with our gathering and processing partners, has allowed us to really substantially reduce our flaring. And we've got - in fact, you can read it on Slide 21, some of the changes we made to our short-term incentive compensation program. And as a reminder, this scorecard, this corporate scorecard that we present in our proxy, that makes up half of every employees' short-term incentive compensation on an annual basis. So, we've got a 15% weighting on our ES&G measures. And you can see what those are on Slide 21. Listed there, safety metrics, our flaring, greenhouse gas emissions, the percent of recycled water, oil spill control and TRIR or total recordable incident rate. There's five measures that make up that ES&G score now. Jeff, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. We've raised our dividend every year since putting it in place three years ago and I think that being the primary return of capital, we're going to look at that very closely at the end of the year and see what 2021 holds on that front. The one consistent theme we received from our largest shareholders over the past few months is to protect the dividend and in exchange for protecting that dividend, cut capital. And that's what I think we're going do. I think overall, we would like our debt to be lower than higher. And I don't want to put out a two year or five-year target on that front because a lot can change in this business, as you've seen in the last three months. But I do want to also emphasize that at the parent company, we still have three companies right? And each of those companies has debt that's manageable. All three companies will be generating free cash flow starting in the third quarter going forward. And on top of that, Diamondback has a lot of ownership in those two subsidiaries which while you can't sell all that in a day, at some point that is a safety valve for how much debt you think you have at the parent company. Look, in terms of the first part of your question, M&A, we are so internally focused right now on doing the things that we need to do. Look, our industry's been rightly criticized for all kinds of noise that have distracted from returns and our focus right now is singularly trying to deliver the highest returns and cash flow for every single dollar we invest. And look, from the public guys, the debt's trading so poorly for the public guys that could potentially be targets, it just doesn't make any sense for us right now. So, that's kind of my view on M&A. And then, I just don't think that it makes sense for Diamondback to be looking at other basins. One of the core philosophies we talk about here is know what you're good at. And Diamondback is really, really good at Permian Basin extraction of hydrocarbons. And that's borne out by our cost structure and our execution metrics. And that's our - that's our emphasis. That's what we're good at; that's what we know we're good at and that's what we're going to maintain. Sure. I'm going to let Kaes answer that. He's got a spreadsheet in front of him. Well, I think, Jeanine, overall, with more Midland Basin as a higher percentage of your total capital, your Midland Basin EUR per foot is lower than the Delaware, but your well costs are significantly lower. So, while I can't give you an exact productivity on well EUR per foot, I do think, in general, the couple hundred wells we're going to complete in 2021 will be a higher productivity on returns basis than 2020 because in 2020 we were heading into the year to complete 350 wells and we've - we've slowed that machine down to complete 185 this year and something close to that next year. And I think just, in general, our next if 80, 85 wells I see on the schedule for the second half of 2020 are significantly better than the first half of 2020, and we expect that level of detail on drilling our best stuff first to carry into 2021. I think we're reluctant to change it just because half the year's gone, and the way we report CapEx, probably three quarters of the year is essentially gone on well-cost perspective. But these lower well costs that we're seeing today in real time will benefit the company in the fourth quarter and into 2021. So, I think it's prudent for us not to change that guidance. But certainly, we expect the trend to continue. You've got to have a lot higher commodity price. I don't know what higher means, but certainly materially higher than what you see today. You also have to have access to capital, which right now's been - there's been capital starvation for a number of quarters for our industry. And rightfully so, as I mentioned earlier, because of our industry's inability to generate through returns but the last part of that would be - certainly, investor sentiment would have to change dramatically from where it sits today. There's quite a bet of headwinds, I think, for our industry as you look ahead to try to think about any kind of meaningful production growth. Well, certainly if we continue to have this environment, as I mentioned earlier, well costs are usually going to stay the same or they're going to go lower. And I think it's reasonable, if commodity prices increase, you'll start to see the service sector - the service sector responds. But look, the Permian Basin is going through a seismic shift in a capital allocation from all the operators, and you can see it in the production responses. We're now below 4 million barrels of oil a day of production. And so, it's just hard to see, in this environment, any meaningful change in the current operating situation that all the companies are faced with here in the Permian. Yes and Charles, just to add to that though, with this continued reduction in activity, and even in this environment. I can't emphasize enough that Diamondback's clear advantage is not only the number of locations we have that we laid out in our slides in terms of inventory, but it's our cost structure. And so, and - the lower the price of the commodity goes and the more the margins get squeezed, the more really efficient, high-margin companies get highlighted. And certainly Diamondback, as evidenced by numbers in this release, falls into that category. Brian, the - Kaes mentioned earlier about how Diamondback has a large ownership position in both our subs, and that continues to literally and figuratively pay dividends to Diamondback shareholders. And it's something the Diamondback board is aware of, but it's - we're comfortable in our position in our ownership of those subs today. You want to add anything to that, Kaes? Well, certainly our industry doesn't have a good track record of that discipline. But I believe that there has been a change in sea level in terms of discipline. And I'm confident that all operators, that at least have any awareness of our industry, are going to be very judicious in trying to resume activities that generate production growth. Well, it's all about the rock, right. So I mean, if you find good rock, you shouldn't care whether it's public or private. But the problem that we're seeing on the public side is how poorly the debt's trading for public companies. And that adds a significant detriment on acreage valuation. On the private side, there's just not that many opportunities out there truthfully of Tier 1 acreage. We're not going to - there's just not a lot of Tier 1 rock that's out there and that's kind of how we differentiate it. There might be a little bit in there, Richard but it's going to be as muted as possible. I think given the shocks that the industry's gone through over the last four months just exemplifies how precious capital is. And I think a lot of our landowners have been pretty accommodating through this. And we're going to do what we can to hold acreage, but also to only drill our best stuff with the majority of the capital. Thank you again to everyone for participating in today's call.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Kurt. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's first quarter 2020 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO.During this conference call the participants may make certain Forward-Looking Statements relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC.In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback\u2019s first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to take a minute to extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the Coronavirus pandemic. The challenges presented so far in 2020 are unprecedented for the first perseverance is evident in the decisive action we have taken to preserve our strength in this cycle.Our organization has now been now been working from home for almost two months. And I can honestly say that business has performed extraordinarily well given the circumstances. Our teams have reacted quickly to the rapidly changing landscape and adjusted our operating and capital program in almost real time to prepare Diamondback for the commodity price weaknesses we are experiencing today.Crisis have a way of revealing characters and we have witnessed this across our organization. And I'm confident that you as our stockholders and owners of the Company will be proud of how our employees have responded in supporting the communities where we live and work. We have an organization of motivated and exceptionally talented people.Turning to the first quarter. Diamondback grew oil production 3% quarter-over-quarter and unhedged oil organization averaged 99% of WCI or highest oil realization in almost two years. We returned 80 operated wells to production in the quarter as our operations machine was executing efficiently before commodity prices weakened and we immediately ceased all completion activity in March.We expected to complete less than 10% of our 2020 well count in second quarter, with the only planned completions for the purpose of [indiscernible] slow operations in the fourth quarter of 2019, and maintained continuous operations with over 20 rigs and eight completion crews running through most of the first quarter. Capital spend was 709 million or a little over 27% of our original capital budget for the year.When commodity prices dropped, we took immediate action and dropped all of our completion crews per month, and are working down our rig count as quickly as possible without paying in early termination fees in existing rig contracts.While we are running 14 rigs today, we will exit May running 10 rigs and enter the third quarter running eight down over 60% from the beginning of the year. We also plan to enter the fourth quarter running seven rigs, with the ability to reduce further into 2021. This rig count reduction combined with our current completion schedule means we will exit 2020 with over 150 ducts.This is over 100 ducts above what will be required as a standard working duct inventory for three to five completion crew program, which is our base case program exiting 2020 as we see things today.While this may be a drag on overall capital efficiency in 2020, it will give us significant flexibility and be a benefit to capital efficiency over the next couple of years, particularly in 2021 as we navigate and uncertain forward outlook.Because CapEx is a cash flow statement number, we will start to see our reduction activity benefit our cash and at the end of the second quarter and through the back half of 2020. As a rule of thumb, activity reductions today are reflected two months later in cash flow statement. While commodity price fluctuations are realized in the month in which they occur.As a result, our CapEx spend will be weighted toward the front half of 2020 with the third quarter, beginning to truly reflect the significant activity reductions that began in March and continued into the second quarter.Diamondback is curtailing gross operating production, about 10% to 15% this month, due to the uncertainty in the forward oil price contracts and the risk of low unhedged realized oil prices for the mill.With differentials in role already set heading into the month at over $10 off the WTI. The risk of WTI prices declining further outweighs the benefit of producing as much as possible into extremely low unhedged realized prices.We have hedged production for nearly 100% of expected oil production before curtailments, including basis in both protection, and therefore can monetize in the money hedges without materially impacting the fact cash flow when production is curtailed.In assessing where to curtail production, we focused on fixed and variable operating costs and underline marketing contracts, choosing to slow production where we do not need to spend significant dollars to do so.We will continue to monitor future prices as we prepare to nominate production for June and the months ahead. And should meaningful curtailments persist or accelerate, we will plan to update our investors accordingly.Looking ahead due to the volatility in commodity prices, there is significant uncertainty in our full business plan. And we are trying to stay flexible on how many completion crews we bring back to work in the second half of the year, and which month both crews get back to work. We need to see some stability in the forward curve before making this decision.In the interim, we will continue to focus on what we can control, which is our cost structure and preserve as much liquidity as possible. We ended the first quarter with 1.9 billion of liquidity and only have one term debt maturity due in the next five years, a 400 million maturity due September 2021. With our reduction in spending, current hedge protection and suspension of our buyback program, we expect to maximize liquidity and retain cash to pay down debt.Our dividends remains our primary return of capitals for our equity holders and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividends based on the current board outlook. Paying our interest expense, retaining our people and paying our dividend remain our priorities through these uncertain times.To finish, Diamondback is prepared to operate in a lower for longer oil price environment and our cost structure will prove to be a differentiator through this downturn. Low interest expense, low leverage, industry leading low cash G&A, a full hedge book, strong midstream contracts and the benefit of Viper and Rattler will allow them to operate effectively through these uncertain times.With these comments now complete. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Singer: Thank you. good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the comment there towards the end with regard to the use of cash and free cash flow. You talked about the spending the buyback, you have got the $400 million debt coming due next year. In a scenario where cash builds beyond that or where your free cash flow gets you above a $400 million cushion to pay down that debt. Do you still hold cash for future debt coming due? Or do you think about either bringing back the buyback considering variable dividends or distributions? How are you thinking about free cash flow and use of cash?\nTravis Stice: Well, certainly that is multiple quarters out as we look into next year and all of those options are still available to us. In terms of - we announced the suspension of a share buyback program. But we also don't have a full - an intention at the board level to afford cash and so, we will continue to be judicious in the way that we allocate excess cash, as we highlighted primarily through the form of our dividend program.\nBrian Singer: Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is with regard to cyclical versus secular benefits from the downside goal, you talk to cost production that you see here this year. And I wondered if you could speak to what you are kind of seeing as potential cyclical versus secular impacts, either on the productivity side and learning there or on the on the cost side, what percent of the cost reductions you are achieving this year, do you think would extend if prices where to rebound?\nTravis Stice: Well, if we just look at the Delaware basin, and particularly I think over the last couple of quarters, we have taken a $100 a foot out of the DC and e-components. And those are permanent savings regardless of the cyclicality of our business. On the midland basin side, we have probably taken out 50 or 60. And again, a lot of those are also going to be made permanent.We understand that our business partners on the service side, are really in a bind, and we do know that in the future, when commodity prices begin to recover, that side of our business will have to repair their balance sheets and we will require more consideration from other operators and that is the cyclical nature of there.But we don't know when that is going to occur. We do think that the rate of change, going forward, just from a planning perspective, the rate of change is getting smaller relative to where it was the last time we went through this in 2015 and 2016.But it is still our organization's intent to find those elements that will survive past the cyclical nature and actually make them permanent in the way that we go about prosecuting our development plan.So what percent, is lot harder to predict? It is smaller today, then when you likely ask me that at 2015 and 2016. But we are still trying everyday to identify and make permanent those savings.\nBrian Singer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Whitfield: Thanks. Good morning all.\nTravis Stice: Good morning.\nDerrick Whitfield: Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, with regard to your 2020 outlook. I certainly appreciate the challenges of providing quarterly guidance in the current environment. Assuming the capital plan outline, is it reasonable to assume the previous exit rate guidance broadly remains in place, less relatively small timing effects associated with returning curtail production back online?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Derek, thank you. That is fair, I think we are sticking to that exit rate guidance, pending, getting back to work in the back half of the year. I think if first of all curtailed volumes seem to come back before we start completing new wells, and if curtailed volumes come back, and then we start completing wells, late in the summer or into the fall, then that number is certainly achievable.[Audio Gap] continue to be curtailed or delay our return back to work and lock update the market, as we have, four times in the last month and a half, and give you the latest data that we are seeing.\nDerrick Whitfield: Thanks very helpful and you guys have been quite responsive in the environment. So certainly appreciate that as well. With my second question, focusing on the voluntary curtailments that you discussed for May, are there any marketing limitations or technical considerations that would limit your ability to compare volumes beyond that 10% to 15% level?\nTravis Stice: No. We are still very far away from any marketing commitments being triggers. We produced a little over 250,000 gross barrels of oil a day in the first quarter. And our true take or pay commitments are about 125,000 barrels a day today. So we are still pretty far away from triggering anything of those. And, the secondary thought behind the cash operating costs was where we are curtailing in the marketing contracts associated with the barrels that we are curtailing.\nDerrick Whitfield: Thanks guys. Very well done in this challenging environment.\nTravis Stice: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nGail Nicholson: Good morning everybody. Just looking at work over. In a normal environments, do you know what percent of LOE workover comprise? And then how should we think about workover activity going forward? And do you have any thoughts if making an adjustment to workover to have an effect on future wells productivity?\nTravis Stice: Yes. So Gail, typically we are round 20, 25 workover hits on a daily basis, just doing routine maintenance and part of this curtailments effects that we are going through right now is that we reduced that number to less than 10, maybe on some days, even less than five. So as wells fail or have problems we are electing, at least in the month of May now to go out and repair them.As long as we don't have those types of failed wells shut-in for a very long period of time, you know months, I'm not worried about having to go back in and remediate those wells. Yet, there will be a cost, but that cost will be pushed out several months in that scenario, but the productivity shouldn't be impacted. And as we are talking about multiple, multiple months. But that is where we are thinking about it now.\nGail Nicholson: Okay, great. And then I really appreciate Slide 9 the color regarding the Midland based contracts. But I'm just curious if you could talk about just how those pieces change regarding an MEH and a Brent contract on Slide 9?\nTravis Stice: Yes Gail, so, we wanted to show the slide to show investors how we are thinking about curtailing volumes. And while we are supposed to put flat price throughout the month, the role and the differentials had already been fixed going into May. I will say its contract dependent, so, all we speak for Diamondback contracts, but, majority of our Brent based contracts have a Brent role components, so it is a Brent role because it is been in less contained [indiscernible] WTI will be a significantly smaller number.\nGail Nicholson: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thank you Gail.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now opened.\nNeal Dingman: Well hope you all been well. My first question centers on really you three stream production growth and specifically how your view in the timing and rate of growth for each of the three streams to ramp after your D&C is suspended, and the production is curtailed or maybe if I would ask another way, how do you view certain I know you got to guide out there but how do you view the near-term future oil versus natural gas growth?\nTravis Stice: Yes Neal. No question with the production stream declining overall, oil going to decline faster than your BOEs and I think we framed our oil production base decline in the mid-30s with our BOE base decline in the low-30s percentages.So, I'm hopeful that if we do get back to work, we are going to try to combat that decline, some high or oil percentage Midland basin activity. But given the uncertainty today, I think overall, those numbers that we have out there on base decline are still valid.\nNeal Dingman: Yes. That is great details. And then just my second question really focuses on cost. You know Travis for you in case you'll continue to be certainly the cost leaders in the group, when you speak to kind of 850 as cash cost, and I think what Midland well cost down, I think what is 700 or 600 per foot. I'm just wondering, you touched on this a little bit earlier. Is there room to squeeze even more out of that or how do you all view just sort of these margins going forward given like a how well you are cost already down to?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I think I answered it a little bit on the previous question about the rate of change and cost is certainly a lot smaller now than it was in 2015 and 2016 when we went through the cycle. Look, there is two ways to work on that. There is things like I emphasized that we can make permanent those things move on forever. And that is, loading completely as well as faster, it get the TD faster, those are all elements of making permanent cost savings.Whether our business partners on the service side, continue to offer concessions, beyond this point, there is probably going to be some, but we do feel like the majority of those have been offered up in the month of April and in May as the industry has recalibrated quicker than anything we have ever seen.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Again I think if you dig into the cash cost fees, we are going to try to keep LOE flattish, productions coming down so that is going to hurt LOE a little bit, G&A is still going to stay best-in-class and the other pieces of cash cost some on the tax piece given percent of revenue, continues to go down, that should come down a little bit. But we are fighting for pennies and nickels here.\nTravis Stice: And you know Neal, we have got a lot of information in our deck, what we are talking about cost, and improvements quarter-over-quarter and I think it is important to recognize that one of the reasons that we try to answer the questions with as much detail as we can and that why as Kaes pointed that we have updated the market four times in the last month and a half.It is because when times were uncertain and our investors that own the company, have questions, transparency is more important than ever. So, even though we might have had a free pass full of guidance, it is just not part of our culture of transparency.We are going to tell you everything we can within the rules of financial disclosure, so that you can make the best investment decisions that you can and the only way that we can do that is to be very, very transparent.And so whether it is in a background, or prepared remarks or in the Q&A that transparency is needed for tenants of dial back energy, and we tend to follow that through these uncertain times and into the future.\nNeal Dingman: Now I appreciate all the details Travis. That certainly helps. Thanks, guys.\nTravis Stice: You bet. Thanks Neal.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber: So before the downturn, there was the expectation that your well productivity on average would improved over the course of 2020, as HBP drilling fell even further and you shifted rigs, probably focusing obviously on best well economics, which includes not only productivity but also obviously well costs and minerals position and infrastructure needs. So can you provide some color on the productivity trend, on a go forward basis from here should it improve, as previously expected and any color an order of magnitude?\nTravis Stice: Well, there is two ways in well productivity is, if you complete in the same well, one month versus next is that productivity improved in the current month versus the prior months. And there is also a way that productivity looks better on the macro sense, because you are shifting the mix of projects that you are doing.And so most of what we were focusing on in our earlier communication was highlighting the shift from the Delaware Basin more towards the Midland Basin where we had mineral ownerships within our sub Viper and then also not having to spend any, or limited infrastructure dollars.So, we are still going to see that effect through the course of this year as our program migrates more into the Midland Basin side. And as I've answered now a couple of times, I still think there is room to see changes that we are making due to doing things better than we have done in the past, and those are the things that that live on as the ones who make current.\nScott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate the color. That is it for me. I will turn it back. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: And let me just add, when you think about where the service sector is, I certainly don't intend to be a spokesperson for the service sector. I don't understand their finances like they do. And so, really whether or not they continue to reduce costs, and it is to the benefit, at least near-term to down with that shareholders.Those are really questions that are best asked and answered on that side. What I'm leaning into our organization for is how can we do things better every day, regardless of the cyclical nature of what our business partners on the service side is.\nScott Gruber: Appreciate the color\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nScott Hanold: Yes, thanks. Thanks for all the colors so far. On the duct, the pretty interesting comment that you guys would be carrying in, 100 ducts into 2021. Can you give a sense of, was that an intentional process through 2020 given the cost structure coming down enough? Was it somewhat where your rig contracts were and just didn\u2019t want to complete the wells or you just wanted some, dry powder of wells to reactivate when you could. So, can you give us a sense of, how you balance that activity and decisions through this year?\nTravis Stice: Yes, it is really Scott a combination of all three of those. I mean, we definitely had rig contracts and every dollar counts and while those rigs counts wind out this year, we didn't want to pay early termination fees. But also when you think about 2021, and carrying in a large number of ducts, we are really covered off on both the bull case and the bear case.In the bull case, we will have a bunch of really high quality ducts that we can bring on to production quickly in 2021 if we get paid for the commodity we produce. On the bear case, if it gets bad, then we probably won't drill many - if any wells at all in 2021 and whatever via maintenance that we feel like we can get paid for we can do that just by completing these extremely high rate of return on a cost forward basis.\nScott Hanold: So my thoughts could be on the decisions, as you look into that bull case, like what are the really the triggers that made you think about that bull case and also just really quickly what do those ducts, how much of an impact on the 2021 maintenance capital did those ducts have?\nTravis Stice: Well, we have never tried to predict oil price and what a bull case looks like in 2021, I'm not even saying that that is necessarily going to occur, what we are trying to do is rather than predict, we are trying to cover off both extremes, what likely outcomes could be next year. In terms of the duct impact on maintenance CapEx?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Scott, we came out with a number. About a month ago, saying could to keep exit rate production flat year-over-year in 2021about 25% less capital than 2020. I think that number still stands. And that probably assumes, you are drawing down 40 or 50 ducts.I think our base case today, if you had to get access in somewhere in the range of three to five completion crews. And the rule of thumb that we have is, 10 working ducts for each completion crew, so we are going to have about 100 extra ducts at year-end 2021, to have options with.\nScott Hanold: Yes. And just to be more specific, I wasn\u2019t asked I guess in particular, what you all think about the bull case of next year? Just what price signal like what price does it have to be to start thinking about getting a little bit more active and dipping into those ducts?\nTravis Stice: Well assuming where we are today, right, the first thing we would have to do is your brain deferred production back on and then to talk about increased activities, again, there is a lot of factors that went into that, but you have got to have prices in the high 20s, or low 30s. Before we kind of signal going back to working in an aggressive, or even in a non-aggressive way. But again, we are going to take all of these things into consideration before we come out in a market on what our activity plans are back half of this year or in the next year as well.\nScott Hanold: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good morning guys, thanks for the time today.\nTravis Stice: You bet, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I was just hoping maybe you could shed a little bit more color on the theoretical 21 maintenance program. How many wells have that division you are being able to or needing to turn in line to hold the current exit guide flat in 2021?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Probably about 150, David. Plus or minus 10 or 15 wells on each side of that, just based on the wells we are drilling today and what just completed and the work we are going to be pretty heavy in Midland basin probably 70/30 Midland basin or 75/25 Midland basin in areas where we have high mineral interest and very little capital required on the infrastructure side.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And then I guess I just wanted to get back to the curtailments. One, could you update us this on I know you kind of hedged your comments and said, if we need to do something in June, then obviously guidance changes. What are your thoughts on June right now? How do you see the market shaping up and balancing? I know these curtailments are economically driven. Price signals have improved the bit for June. What are you seeing, we are just excited in the basin side? And how do you see the shaping up with granted, we are several weeks away, but how is it looking currently?\nTravis Stice: Well, you know looking a little better for June to be honest. If the dips in the well, being significantly, you want to well side significantly less negative on the dip side, being Midland trading at a premium recently for WTI and on top of that WTL trading at a premium to WTI.So I never thought $22 would be exciting, but here we are, looking at our cash cost for June and I think as we sit today, we have nominations due in two weeks. As we sit today it certainly looks better for the June month from a contract perspective than it did in May.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Yes, cheers for 2022. If I could just have one quick one, just thinking about the logistics of the curtail volumes that you have now, I guess about 2,500% wells in Midlands, another 500 plus in the Delaware, what percentage overall of those wells are being curtailed right now? Or I guess how many wells can you say are being curtailed?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, just about 500 total, and I would say over two-thirds of those are in the Delaware. And so what we really focused on, and we really focused on the term curtail, because we are not shutting these wells in and having spend dollars to shut well in. We are trying to limit the cash outflow and really, just curtail producing wealth to a lower level than where they were in April and March.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Thanks for the color guys.\nTravis Stice: You bet. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Grampp: God morning. I was curious how you guys - maybe a kind of philosophical question, pricing environment both on the commodity and well cost have obviously changed quite a bit over the last several months. Are you guys internally discussing maybe reevaluating, wells spacing or completion techniques as far as what an optimal design could be and with today's service costs and oil price environment?\nTravis Stice: Yes, those are certainly things that we are examining, but one thing that, I have been pleased with is that our spacing assumptions when they have been validated now for almost five years, really haven't ever changed and we have never been part of that drill wells too closely or stack and to tightly together.So, the rule of thumb has always been, the higher the oil price, the closer spaces, you could put your wells because you can capitalize on acceleration and the lower price, or is the water you should spread out, but we have been, we follow that, but we have been pleased that our spacing assumptions seem to struck the right balance now for multiple years and a lot of technical review with our reserve auditors have validated that.So we have never really tightened them up and then some instances, maybe even in Delaware, in some of the new developed zones, we might have slightly increased the well spacing, but in a general sense, we have been very conservative on how we count locations and how we develop these reservoirs.When you look at the completion side, Jeff we are always trying to do everything we can to extract the most hydrocarbons from these rocks and it was stimulated rock volume near well bores is a key. And I can tell you the scientists and engineering and geology scientists that we have, they are always, tweaking with that.So while we can look at spacing, we have to get down and completing the well. That just a constant work in progress, and this is always evolving. And that will never change, I can promise you.\nJeff Grampp: Understood. And then kind of more of a housekeeping one if I may. The decks that you guys are kind of building in real time here and we have talked about it couple of times in the call already. Are those weighted to maybe certain operating areas or Midland versus Delaware focused?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. It is really about 70/30 Midland, Delaware and multiple rigs are moving towards Midland basin, where we have a high mineral interest and you know setting ourselves up for the most capital efficient return to work possible.\nJeff Grampp: Got it? Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAsit Sen: Thanks. Good morning, I have one for Kaes, one for Travis. Kaes, on counterparties and flow assurance, thanks for all the detail update in the slide deck. My question is there have been some reports on the sea borne market getting backed up. Can you talk directly about the condition of the export market perhaps into the next couple of months? And in terms of take or pay liabilities, could you update us in theory on what happens if there is a physical slow bottleneck in any of these pipes?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I don't know all the details about the sea borne market, but as you know, it is more liquid than what we have seen especially in the last few weeks. So you are certainly starting to see spreads, widening barrels get on the water now, tanker rates certainly spiked a little bit, which would impact our realizations. But they have come back down a little bit here.But overall, the whole point of our marketing arrangement is to provide insurance in times of uncertainty, which we are in right now. And being able to call only four marketers and know that our barrels are going to move is something that allows us to stick a little better at night.On the take or pay fees, 125,000 barrels a day is take or pay from a sales perspective, as well as from a pipeline perspective. Should the sales piece declare force measure, which would be the only instance where those barrels don't move? Our total pipeline commitments right now and [indiscernible] is about, $20 million per pipe per year, if we didn't send one barrel down the pipe.\nAsit Sen: Thanks, Kaes. Travis on a potential restart scenario, how quickly could you restart operations? What are the price signals? And what are some of the other broader considerations would you consider before adding on regular completion crew?\nTravis Stice: Well, it should only be driven by economics, right. And so, the first thing we would do is, obviously, get our curtailed volumes back into the production equation, and then following that we will get economics about, what is the service sector is going to charge to come back to work, and then we will balance that against with our expectations are for the forward curve and make an economic decision on that, I think I alluded to some form of start in the high 20s and low 30s.But really if you flash all the way out there to what our world used to look like in growth, that is back the prices that you saw last year. So I think as we evolve as an industry into this new order. I think it is going to look a lot different than what historically we have accustomed to.\nAsit Sen: I appreciate it. Thanks Travis.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a lot of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Travis, you and your whole team.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Travis, you have anticipated? I guess my question in your response to your earlier one, I get the point that you guys are prepared for longer scenario, but also it seems from the outside looking in that you guys are more prepared, more on your front foot for a V-shaped recovery. In other words, you are better positioned than other in the industry to go back to work hard in the back half of the year. Is that inaccurate do you think and how would you elaborate on that?\nTravis Stice: Yes, well first, we are certainly not in the prediction of what recovery is going to look like V-shape or U-shape or whatever. But what we are trying to do is demonstrate flexibility to our investors that whether it is lower, longer, we are prepared for that with our financial strength, or whether the market signals that it is time to go back to work, we are also prepared for that.But again, back to my transparency comment, in these uncertain times, whichever scenario plays out, you can count on us, stepping forward and letting our investors know exactly what we are thinking about the business and the strategic rationale behind the decisions that we make.\nCharles Meade: Got it. And then may be following up a little bit on that, actually I guess if you are not completing wells right now, but you guys are still going to run a concision crew for part of the quarter and I know you said that is for lease retention or lease obligations consideration.I'm curious I imagine there have been other options you evaluated about going back to the mineral owners and maybe offering up a rental or some other thing. Are there other considerations that are going on that are leading up to compete in 15 or 20 wells or so in 2Q rather than do some of those other lease obligation options?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Charles you know a lot of those wells probably already in progress, heading into the quarter so you can\u2019t have that discussion in a mid completion. We are working with our mineral owners and we happen pretty easy to work with through this given where we are flat price is.So if we can push out whatever we can, whenever we can. We are trying to do that, it is hard to 1,280 acre units, get in touch with 40 mineral owners in a month. But, we have been working diligently to extend leases and extend completion dates.\nTravis Stice: Yes. Charles, just to add to that the complexity is, unless you are actually inside, it is hard to communicate but I will say it, our land organizations and our land professionals, they are engaged, almost, they engaged every day and feels like a nice light to work on lease terms to avoid, having a drill or completed well and when we are not getting paid for the commodity.So, as Kaes indicated, a lot of our mineral owners understand the business and are trying to make, concessions. But also it is very difficult at times to get everyone on the same page and all it takes is one person to say no, and then your hand is forced. So, really proud of our land organization and the work they are doing says to get us to the point where we are only running one completion through honor minimum obligations this quarter.\nCharles Meade: Thank you for the detail.\nTravis Stice: Thanks Charles\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open.\nRichard Tullis: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Travis, generally how much runway do you have as far as well inventory to continue on the current path where you are drilling the areas with higher NRI and lower infrastructure needs?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Richard, I think we try to be as open as possible and show what our gross from that inventory is on Slide 13 and Slide 14 in deck and we update that every year. And I think one of the benefits of slowing down is you are not burning through as much inventory that quickly.So I think without needing to complete 150, 160 wells keep our production flat 75% of in the Midland basin, you got a pretty long runway of high quality employee, to survive a lower for longer environment.\nTravis Stice: We have got over 12,000 gross locations still in front of us, Richard and which is slowdown in activity or stoppage in activity, exactly as Kaes said, we are actually extending our inventory runway as a result of completing those wells and adding the license.\nRichard Tullis: Okay. Thank you. And secondly, you know any plans to resume testing of the limelight acreage in the second half of the year or does that just need to wait for substantially higher oil prices?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, probably the way we are having discussions with the mineral owners right now on extending our delaying our next payer.\nRichard Tullis: Okay. That is all from me. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thank you Tullis.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open.\nJason Wangler: Hey, good morning. Just had one, and obviously something we have talked a lot about in the past, but it is probably weird now. But as far as you have got plenty of inventory, certainly, but you are in a much better position than so many others around you, as you think about this playing out, and maybe some point getting more impressive. Are you seeing anything that is maybe interesting from the M&A side or maybe how do you just kind of see that playing out as we kind of go forward in this environment?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Jason, this is all about demonstrating our financial strength and getting to the other side of the recovery. When we are there, when the market signal is there, I think a question has more validity, but right now you know it is doing, what we are doing, which is maximizing cash flow and preserving liquidity.\nJason Wangler: Fair enough. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. You line is now open.\nMichael Hall: Thanks, good morning. I appreciate the time, a lot have been addressed. But, one that is kind of been touched on a little bit but wanted to follow-up on is just in the context of signaling or what sort of price signals are required to get back to kind of quarter-on-quarter gross or move beyond that maintenance capital program in 2021? Number one, what might those prices theoretically look like, it sounds like maybe last year's type of level, but just wanted to confirm that? And then number two, maybe more philosophically like, how are you thinking about the combination of frozen payout from on a longer term basis, is the growth side of that combination, structurally lower than it was a year ago, let's say after what we have just been through, or is it really not affected and it will really just be a function of what prices and returns look like whenever that time comes?\nTravis Stice: I think our industry is evolving perhaps as a more rapid pace than it ever had. And if we were making changes at the end of last year, as an industry, with a slower growth and a greater return model. And then I've got take in the hyper-speed in March to this year.So, this new oil order as we looked ahead, as we are going to have what feels like, at least today, it is going to feel like a lot lower growth in a more prescriptive way of returning, investments or returning, returns to our investors.And I think it is still going to evolve in the course of this year, but certainly under what is a strip looks like it is going to definitely be a lot lower growth profile. But we want to make sure we maintain a dividend and resume - when you maximize our cash flow, when appropriate the market signals, you have purely growth there - all those t the same at time.\nMichael Hall: Okay. I mean is it fair to say in a 40 to 50 range all else equal today knowing that all else equal a hard assumption to make but that that is just maybe round about the level that would signal getting back to a quarter-on-quarter growth profile?\nTravis Stice: Yes. It is more than just the just an oil price. I think I said earlier that if you look at some of the prices that we got in 2019, that certainly signal that you can get more aggressive on the growth, but I think we have got to be pretty careful and being super scripted on what exact price signals may look like before you get back to growth. Again, just want to make sure we maintain our dividends, maximize our cash flow and when it is time to grow, now back we will have few leading growth along with the dividend and maximize cash flow.\nMichael Hall: Understood, appreciate the color.\nTravis Stice: Just to finish that part, I kind of went on a little earlier about transparency and I think it is important, again to emphasize here, we are trying to communicate as transparent as we can the way that we see the future, and you can count on us as the future gets clear, we are going to update the market.Like you said, we have done it four times in the last five weeks. And we are going to continue to be communicative and we are going to continue to demonstrate one of the hallmarks of our corporate culture which is transparency, and we will let you know as these things evolve.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Travis Stice for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Sure, thank you. Listen to before I close this morning, I wanted to share with you guys a final thought. We have all had what feels like an unreasonable amount of time to reflect over the last couple of months as we have worked remotely or sheltered in place. And when I'm not doing that, and looking back into over 35 years I've had in the industry, there is been several significant events that have stood out. The challenger spaceship disaster in 1986, the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, of course, 9/11, and now we are involve in a worldwide pandemic caused by the Coronavirus.But when I look back at those historical events that that I participated in, during those times, there were really two defining attributes that I felt were demonstrated. The first is, is really the resiliency of the American people. Even in the face of human tragedy and financial tragedy, we found a way to move forward.And the second attribute and I think it is important in today's environment is hope, hope that we will get through this and hope that our situation will get better. And so as we get this country back to work, let's count on that resiliency once again. Let's also remind each other the importance of hope. Hope for ourselves, for our kids and our grandkids that tomorrow will be better.Thank you for participating in today's call. Please reach out if you have any questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

But we are fighting for pennies and nickels here. Yes. Scott, we came out with a number. About a month ago, saying could to keep exit rate production flat year-over-year in 2021about 25% less capital than 2020. I think that number still stands. And that probably assumes, you are drawing down 40 or 50 ducts.I think our base case today, if you had to get access in somewhere in the range of three to five completion crews. And the rule of thumb that we have is, 10 working ducts for each completion crew, so we are going to have about 100 extra ducts at year-end 2021, to have options with. Probably about 150, David. Plus or minus 10 or 15 wells on each side of that, just based on the wells we are drilling today and what just completed and the work we are going to be pretty heavy in Midland basin probably 70/30 Midland basin or 75/25 Midland basin in areas where we have high mineral interest and very little capital required on the infrastructure side.

            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to take a minute to extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the Coronavirus pandemic. The challenges presented so far in 2020 are unprecedented for the first perseverance is evident in the decisive action we have taken to preserve our strength in this cycle.Our organization has now been now been working from home for almost two months. And I can honestly say that business has performed extraordinarily well given the circumstances. Our teams have reacted quickly to the rapidly changing landscape and adjusted our operating and capital program in almost real time to prepare Diamondback for the commodity price weaknesses we are experiencing today.Crisis have a way of revealing characters and we have witnessed this across our organization. And I'm confident that you as our stockholders and owners of the Company will be proud of how our employees have responded in supporting the communities where we live and work. We have an organization of motivated and exceptionally talented people.Turning to the first quarter. Diamondback grew oil production 3% quarter-over-quarter and unhedged oil organization averaged 99% of WCI or highest oil realization in almost two years. We returned 80 operated wells to production in the quarter as our operations machine was executing efficiently before commodity prices weakened and we immediately ceased all completion activity in March.We expected to complete less than 10% of our 2020 well count in second quarter, with the only planned completions for the purpose of [indiscernible] slow operations in the fourth quarter of 2019, and maintained continuous operations with over 20 rigs and eight completion crews running through most of the first quarter. Capital spend was 709 million or a little over 27% of our original capital budget for the year.When commodity prices dropped, we took immediate action and dropped all of our completion crews per month, and are working down our rig count as quickly as possible without paying in early termination fees in existing rig contracts.While we are running 14 rigs today, we will exit May running 10 rigs and enter the third quarter running eight down over 60% from the beginning of the year. We also plan to enter the fourth quarter running seven rigs, with the ability to reduce further into 2021. This rig count reduction combined with our current completion schedule means we will exit 2020 with over 150 ducts.This is over 100 ducts above what will be required as a standard working duct inventory for three to five completion crew program, which is our base case program exiting 2020 as we see things today.While this may be a drag on overall capital efficiency in 2020, it will give us significant flexibility and be a benefit to capital efficiency over the next couple of years, particularly in 2021 as we navigate and uncertain forward outlook.Because CapEx is a cash flow statement number, we will start to see our reduction activity benefit our cash and at the end of the second quarter and through the back half of 2020. As a rule of thumb, activity reductions today are reflected two months later in cash flow statement. While commodity price fluctuations are realized in the month in which they occur.As a result, our CapEx spend will be weighted toward the front half of 2020 with the third quarter, beginning to truly reflect the significant activity reductions that began in March and continued into the second quarter.Diamondback is curtailing gross operating production, about 10% to 15% this month, due to the uncertainty in the forward oil price contracts and the risk of low unhedged realized oil prices for the mill.With differentials in role already set heading into the month at over $10 off the WTI. The risk of WTI prices declining further outweighs the benefit of producing as much as possible into extremely low unhedged realized prices.We have hedged production for nearly 100% of expected oil production before curtailments, including basis in both protection, and therefore can monetize in the money hedges without materially impacting the fact cash flow when production is curtailed.In assessing where to curtail production, we focused on fixed and variable operating costs and underline marketing contracts, choosing to slow production where we do not need to spend significant dollars to do so.We will continue to monitor future prices as we prepare to nominate production for June and the months ahead. And should meaningful curtailments persist or accelerate, we will plan to update our investors accordingly.Looking ahead due to the volatility in commodity prices, there is significant uncertainty in our full business plan. And we are trying to stay flexible on how many completion crews we bring back to work in the second half of the year, and which month both crews get back to work. We need to see some stability in the forward curve before making this decision.In the interim, we will continue to focus on what we can control, which is our cost structure and preserve as much liquidity as possible. We ended the first quarter with 1.9 billion of liquidity and only have one term debt maturity due in the next five years, a 400 million maturity due September 2021. With our reduction in spending, current hedge protection and suspension of our buyback program, we expect to maximize liquidity and retain cash to pay down debt.Our dividends remains our primary return of capitals for our equity holders and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividends based on the current board outlook. Paying our interest expense, retaining our people and paying our dividend remain our priorities through these uncertain times.To finish, Diamondback is prepared to operate in a lower for longer oil price environment and our cost structure will prove to be a differentiator through this downturn. Low interest expense, low leverage, industry leading low cash G&A, a full hedge book, strong midstream contracts and the benefit of Viper and Rattler will allow them to operate effectively through these uncertain times.With these comments now complete. Operator, please open the line for questions. Well, certainly that is multiple quarters out as we look into next year and all of those options are still available to us. In terms of - we announced the suspension of a share buyback program. But we also don't have a full - an intention at the board level to afford cash and so, we will continue to be judicious in the way that we allocate excess cash, as we highlighted primarily through the form of our dividend program. Well, if we just look at the Delaware basin, and particularly I think over the last couple of quarters, we have taken a $100 a foot out of the DC and e-components. And those are permanent savings regardless of the cyclicality of our business. On the midland basin side, we have probably taken out 50 or 60. And again, a lot of those are also going to be made permanent.We understand that our business partners on the service side, are really in a bind, and we do know that in the future, when commodity prices begin to recover, that side of our business will have to repair their balance sheets and we will require more consideration from other operators and that is the cyclical nature of there.But we don't know when that is going to occur. We do think that the rate of change, going forward, just from a planning perspective, the rate of change is getting smaller relative to where it was the last time we went through this in 2015 and 2016.But it is still our organization's intent to find those elements that will survive past the cyclical nature and actually make them permanent in the way that we go about prosecuting our development plan.So what percent, is lot harder to predict? It is smaller today, then when you likely ask me that at 2015 and 2016. But we are still trying everyday to identify and make permanent those savings. Good morning. Yes. Derek, thank you. That is fair, I think we are sticking to that exit rate guidance, pending, getting back to work in the back half of the year. I think if first of all curtailed volumes seem to come back before we start completing new wells, and if curtailed volumes come back, and then we start completing wells, late in the summer or into the fall, then that number is certainly achievable.[Audio Gap] continue to be curtailed or delay our return back to work and lock update the market, as we have, four times in the last month and a half, and give you the latest data that we are seeing. No. We are still very far away from any marketing commitments being triggers. We produced a little over 250,000 gross barrels of oil a day in the first quarter. And our true take or pay commitments are about 125,000 barrels a day today. So we are still pretty far away from triggering anything of those. And, the secondary thought behind the cash operating costs was where we are curtailing in the marketing contracts associated with the barrels that we are curtailing. Thank you. Yes. So Gail, typically we are round 20, 25 workover hits on a daily basis, just doing routine maintenance and part of this curtailments effects that we are going through right now is that we reduced that number to less than 10, maybe on some days, even less than five. So as wells fail or have problems we are electing, at least in the month of May now to go out and repair them.As long as we don't have those types of failed wells shut-in for a very long period of time, you know months, I'm not worried about having to go back in and remediate those wells. Yet, there will be a cost, but that cost will be pushed out several months in that scenario, but the productivity shouldn't be impacted. And as we are talking about multiple, multiple months. But that is where we are thinking about it now. Yes Gail, so, we wanted to show the slide to show investors how we are thinking about curtailing volumes. And while we are supposed to put flat price throughout the month, the role and the differentials had already been fixed going into May. I will say its contract dependent, so, all we speak for Diamondback contracts, but, majority of our Brent based contracts have a Brent role components, so it is a Brent role because it is been in less contained [indiscernible] WTI will be a significantly smaller number. Thank you Gail. Yes Neal. No question with the production stream declining overall, oil going to decline faster than your BOEs and I think we framed our oil production base decline in the mid-30s with our BOE base decline in the low-30s percentages.So, I'm hopeful that if we do get back to work, we are going to try to combat that decline, some high or oil percentage Midland basin activity. But given the uncertainty today, I think overall, those numbers that we have out there on base decline are still valid. Yes. I think I answered it a little bit on the previous question about the rate of change and cost is certainly a lot smaller now than it was in 2015 and 2016 when we went through the cycle. Look, there is two ways to work on that. There is things like I emphasized that we can make permanent those things move on forever. And that is, loading completely as well as faster, it get the TD faster, those are all elements of making permanent cost savings.Whether our business partners on the service side, continue to offer concessions, beyond this point, there is probably going to be some, but we do feel like the majority of those have been offered up in the month of April and in May as the industry has recalibrated quicker than anything we have ever seen. And you know Neal, we have got a lot of information in our deck, what we are talking about cost, and improvements quarter-over-quarter and I think it is important to recognize that one of the reasons that we try to answer the questions with as much detail as we can and that why as Kaes pointed that we have updated the market four times in the last month and a half.It is because when times were uncertain and our investors that own the company, have questions, transparency is more important than ever. So, even though we might have had a free pass full of guidance, it is just not part of our culture of transparency.We are going to tell you everything we can within the rules of financial disclosure, so that you can make the best investment decisions that you can and the only way that we can do that is to be very, very transparent.And so whether it is in a background, or prepared remarks or in the Q&A that transparency is needed for tenants of dial back energy, and we tend to follow that through these uncertain times and into the future. You bet. Thanks Neal. Good morning, Scott. Well, there is two ways in well productivity is, if you complete in the same well, one month versus next is that productivity improved in the current month versus the prior months. And there is also a way that productivity looks better on the macro sense, because you are shifting the mix of projects that you are doing.And so most of what we were focusing on in our earlier communication was highlighting the shift from the Delaware Basin more towards the Midland Basin where we had mineral ownerships within our sub Viper and then also not having to spend any, or limited infrastructure dollars.So, we are still going to see that effect through the course of this year as our program migrates more into the Midland Basin side. And as I've answered now a couple of times, I still think there is room to see changes that we are making due to doing things better than we have done in the past, and those are the things that that live on as the ones who make current. And let me just add, when you think about where the service sector is, I certainly don't intend to be a spokesperson for the service sector. I don't understand their finances like they do. And so, really whether or not they continue to reduce costs, and it is to the benefit, at least near-term to down with that shareholders.Those are really questions that are best asked and answered on that side. What I'm leaning into our organization for is how can we do things better every day, regardless of the cyclical nature of what our business partners on the service side is. Yes, it is really Scott a combination of all three of those. I mean, we definitely had rig contracts and every dollar counts and while those rigs counts wind out this year, we didn't want to pay early termination fees. But also when you think about 2021, and carrying in a large number of ducts, we are really covered off on both the bull case and the bear case.In the bull case, we will have a bunch of really high quality ducts that we can bring on to production quickly in 2021 if we get paid for the commodity we produce. On the bear case, if it gets bad, then we probably won't drill many - if any wells at all in 2021 and whatever via maintenance that we feel like we can get paid for we can do that just by completing these extremely high rate of return on a cost forward basis. Well, we have never tried to predict oil price and what a bull case looks like in 2021, I'm not even saying that that is necessarily going to occur, what we are trying to do is rather than predict, we are trying to cover off both extremes, what likely outcomes could be next year. In terms of the duct impact on maintenance CapEx? Well assuming where we are today, right, the first thing we would have to do is your brain deferred production back on and then to talk about increased activities, again, there is a lot of factors that went into that, but you have got to have prices in the high 20s, or low 30s. Before we kind of signal going back to working in an aggressive, or even in a non-aggressive way. But again, we are going to take all of these things into consideration before we come out in a market on what our activity plans are back half of this year or in the next year as well. You bet, David. Well, you know looking a little better for June to be honest. If the dips in the well, being significantly, you want to well side significantly less negative on the dip side, being Midland trading at a premium recently for WTI and on top of that WTL trading at a premium to WTI.So I never thought $22 would be exciting, but here we are, looking at our cash cost for June and I think as we sit today, we have nominations due in two weeks. As we sit today it certainly looks better for the June month from a contract perspective than it did in May. You bet. Thanks. Yes, those are certainly things that we are examining, but one thing that, I have been pleased with is that our spacing assumptions when they have been validated now for almost five years, really haven't ever changed and we have never been part of that drill wells too closely or stack and to tightly together.So, the rule of thumb has always been, the higher the oil price, the closer spaces, you could put your wells because you can capitalize on acceleration and the lower price, or is the water you should spread out, but we have been, we follow that, but we have been pleased that our spacing assumptions seem to struck the right balance now for multiple years and a lot of technical review with our reserve auditors have validated that.So we have never really tightened them up and then some instances, maybe even in Delaware, in some of the new developed zones, we might have slightly increased the well spacing, but in a general sense, we have been very conservative on how we count locations and how we develop these reservoirs.When you look at the completion side, Jeff we are always trying to do everything we can to extract the most hydrocarbons from these rocks and it was stimulated rock volume near well bores is a key. And I can tell you the scientists and engineering and geology scientists that we have, they are always, tweaking with that.So while we can look at spacing, we have to get down and completing the well. That just a constant work in progress, and this is always evolving. And that will never change, I can promise you. Well, it should only be driven by economics, right. And so, the first thing we would do is, obviously, get our curtailed volumes back into the production equation, and then following that we will get economics about, what is the service sector is going to charge to come back to work, and then we will balance that against with our expectations are for the forward curve and make an economic decision on that, I think I alluded to some form of start in the high 20s and low 30s.But really if you flash all the way out there to what our world used to look like in growth, that is back the prices that you saw last year. So I think as we evolve as an industry into this new order. I think it is going to look a lot different than what historically we have accustomed to. Thank you, Charles. Yes, well first, we are certainly not in the prediction of what recovery is going to look like V-shape or U-shape or whatever. But what we are trying to do is demonstrate flexibility to our investors that whether it is lower, longer, we are prepared for that with our financial strength, or whether the market signals that it is time to go back to work, we are also prepared for that.But again, back to my transparency comment, in these uncertain times, whichever scenario plays out, you can count on us, stepping forward and letting our investors know exactly what we are thinking about the business and the strategic rationale behind the decisions that we make. Yes. Charles, just to add to that the complexity is, unless you are actually inside, it is hard to communicate but I will say it, our land organizations and our land professionals, they are engaged, almost, they engaged every day and feels like a nice light to work on lease terms to avoid, having a drill or completed well and when we are not getting paid for the commodity.So, as Kaes indicated, a lot of our mineral owners understand the business and are trying to make, concessions. But also it is very difficult at times to get everyone on the same page and all it takes is one person to say no, and then your hand is forced. So, really proud of our land organization and the work they are doing says to get us to the point where we are only running one completion through honor minimum obligations this quarter. Thanks Charles We have got over 12,000 gross locations still in front of us, Richard and which is slowdown in activity or stoppage in activity, exactly as Kaes said, we are actually extending our inventory runway as a result of completing those wells and adding the license. Thank you Tullis. Yes. Jason, this is all about demonstrating our financial strength and getting to the other side of the recovery. When we are there, when the market signal is there, I think a question has more validity, but right now you know it is doing, what we are doing, which is maximizing cash flow and preserving liquidity. You bet. I think our industry is evolving perhaps as a more rapid pace than it ever had. And if we were making changes at the end of last year, as an industry, with a slower growth and a greater return model. And then I've got take in the hyper-speed in March to this year.So, this new oil order as we looked ahead, as we are going to have what feels like, at least today, it is going to feel like a lot lower growth in a more prescriptive way of returning, investments or returning, returns to our investors.And I think it is still going to evolve in the course of this year, but certainly under what is a strip looks like it is going to definitely be a lot lower growth profile. But we want to make sure we maintain a dividend and resume - when you maximize our cash flow, when appropriate the market signals, you have purely growth there - all those t the same at time. Yes. It is more than just the just an oil price. I think I said earlier that if you look at some of the prices that we got in 2019, that certainly signal that you can get more aggressive on the growth, but I think we have got to be pretty careful and being super scripted on what exact price signals may look like before you get back to growth. Again, just want to make sure we maintain our dividends, maximize our cash flow and when it is time to grow, now back we will have few leading growth along with the dividend and maximize cash flow. Just to finish that part, I kind of went on a little earlier about transparency and I think it is important, again to emphasize here, we are trying to communicate as transparent as we can the way that we see the future, and you can count on us as the future gets clear, we are going to update the market.Like you said, we have done it four times in the last five weeks. And we are going to continue to be communicative and we are going to continue to demonstrate one of the hallmarks of our corporate culture which is transparency, and we will let you know as these things evolve. Sure, thank you. Listen to before I close this morning, I wanted to share with you guys a final thought. We have all had what feels like an unreasonable amount of time to reflect over the last couple of months as we have worked remotely or sheltered in place. And when I'm not doing that, and looking back into over 35 years I've had in the industry, there is been several significant events that have stood out. The challenger spaceship disaster in 1986, the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, of course, 9/11, and now we are involve in a worldwide pandemic caused by the Coronavirus.But when I look back at those historical events that that I participated in, during those times, there were really two defining attributes that I felt were demonstrated. The first is, is really the resiliency of the American people. Even in the face of human tragedy and financial tragedy, we found a way to move forward.And the second attribute and I think it is important in today's environment is hope, hope that we will get through this and hope that our situation will get better. And so as we get this country back to work, let's count on that resiliency once again. Let's also remind each other the importance of hope. Hope for ourselves, for our kids and our grandkids that tomorrow will be better.Thank you for participating in today's call. Please reach out if you have any questions."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Earlis. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van\u2019t Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company\u2019s financial conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. 2021 was a great year for Diamondback and our industry with higher product prices allowing the vast majority of our industry to one repair and improve balance sheets quickly; two, accelerate returns to shareholders; and three, make significant progress on environmental objectives. At Diamondback, we reduced our absolute debt by $1.3 billion, increased our base dividend every quarter, initiated a return of capital framework and announced ambitious environmental goals designed to help us earn our environmental license to operate. In the fourth quarter alone, buoyed by commodity price strength, Diamondback generated $772 million of free cash flow with production and capital both positively exceeding expectations. We returned 67% of this free cash flow to stockholders, which was above our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders quarterly. This return was made up of $106 million allocated to our growing base dividend, now at $2.40 a share on an annualized basis, which represents a current yield of approximately 2% and $409 million in share purchases as we bought back nearly 3.9 million shares at an average price of just under $106 per share. We are at the beginning of an incredible period of value creation for the industry. And I\u2019m confident that the capital discipline demonstrated by us and our peers in 2021 will continue putting returns and therefore shareholders first. We believe this is the best near-term path to equity value creation as our shift from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital cements itself as our long-term business model. Two months into 2022, economies are rapidly reopening around the world stoking demand, which we believe to be close to if not above pre-pandemic levels. On the supply side, we are witnessing some underperformance from OPEC+ to meet this increasing demand, calling into question spare capacity with global inventory numbers now approaching 2010 to 2014 levels. We cited both global oil inventories and OPEC spare capacity as impediments to any discussion around U.S. public company oil growth, and those issues appear to have subsided for now. However, the global balance remains tenuous at best with up to a million barrels per day of additional Iranian barrels potentially coming online sometime this year and U.S. growth expectations continuing to climb higher led by private companies and more importantly or more recently measures. Both of these supply factors could be bearish signals for oil, therefore Diamondback\u2019s team and board believe that we have no reason to put growth before returns. Our shareholders, the owners of our company agreed. And as a result, we will continue to be disciplined, keeping our oil production flat this year. As such our plan for this year is simple. Maintain oil reduction of approximately 220,000 barrels per day by spending between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. At current strip pricing, this production and capital spend equates to nearly $4 billion of free cash flow, which to our returns framework gives a minimum of $2 billion of cash back to our investors. At the same time, we are committed to permanent returns to our investors, which is why we continue to lean into our base dividend, increasing it again by 20% this quarter. Our growing base dividend is our primary means of returning capital and we\u2019ve increased it by quarterly CAGR of over 10%, since it was initiated in 2018. Today, we have line of sight to get our dividend to $3 a share by the end of this year, if market conditions remain favorable, which would mean 25% of our 2022 distributable free cash flow would be allocated through this constant predictable form of shareholder return. History has taught us that oil is a volatile commodity and that the macro environment will not always be this favorable. So we continue to work towards protecting our base dividend down to $35 WTI with a view that this dividend is really just a form of debt and if plus our maintenance capital budget have to be protected to the extreme downside. By continuing to focus on our fortress balance sheet and layering on our strategic derivative positions to our hedge book, we are confident in our ability to perform in any environment. While the base dividend is the primary tool of returning capital, we will also utilize share repurchases and potentially variable dividends to reach at least 50% of distributed free cash flow on a quarterly basis. We continue to repurchase shares opportunistically, taking advantage of volatility while generating returns on these repurchases well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices, which today is assumed to be around $60 WTI. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve spent $430 million or 22% of the $2 billion program our Board authorized last September. If the free cash flow returned through our base dividend and repurchase program does not equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors hold by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend and most importantly allows at least 50% of free cash flow to be returned. However, it is important that the Board also retains discretion on what to do with the other 50% of the free cash flow generated. As was the case in the fourth quarter, we have the ability to distribute above and beyond our 50% threshold if we feel comfortable with our balance sheet and associated cash balance and do not have a use for excess cash, we will return that cash aggressively to shareholders. Some quarters, we will distribute 50% of free cash flow, but in others we will have the ability to return more, just like we did in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we fully expect to differentiate ourselves not only by our returns framework but more importantly through our consistent execution in the field. Last year, our clear fluid design lowered our average drilling days in the Midland Basin by approximately 35%. That\u2019s an astounding achievement for our drilling department. On the frac side, our simul-frac operations continue to reduce our time on pad as we are now averaging 3,200 feet per day with our four-well simul-frac design. As we\u2019ve laid out in our investor deck, these operational efficiencies have helped us mitigate the substantial cost pressures we\u2019ve seen related to consumables and labor and as we noted last quarter, these gains will be permanent, giving us more variable cost control than our peers due to these industry-leading drilling and completion times. Now when you bake in these cost increases and offset them with our efficiency gain, this equates to about 10% of additional capital spend year-over-year, which is baked into our guidance. We will try to offset this inflation by doing what we do best, innovating, implementing new technology and drilling more efficient and better wells. As mentioned, we were able to offset a vast majority of pricing increases we faced last year through this type of innovation. And we\u2019re confident we can maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure this year. At the same time, we are fortunate to have multiple pieces of our capital cost structure locked in with contracts and dedications like our water and sand supply. As the rig count in the Permian climbs, we will continue to work to control other components of our cost structure, particularly services, labor and consumable products while continuing to be the leader in cash margin and capital efficiency. Finally, I\u2019d like to close by detailing the strides we\u2019ve made in our environmental, social and governance practices. To begin, we met four of our five environmental goals in 2021, which had a 20% weighting in management\u2019s short-term compensation this year and included specific targets related to flaring, water recycling, GHG emission intensity, produced liquid spills and total recordable incidents. Unfortunately, we did not meet our expectation of flaring less than 1% of gross gas produced. While we met this goal on legacy Diamondback acreage, which was how the goal was set, we missed our target when incorporating our acquired QEP assets, which included the QEP Bakken asset we divested in October. We will continue to improve our takeaway on the acquired Permian acreage and partner with our midstream companies to not only structure contracts then incentivize takeaway in price-agnostic environments, but also apply performance-based incentives and penalties related to flaring. All of our progress in 2021 positions us well to hit our long-term goals of reducing our GHG and methane intensity by 50% and 70%, respectively, by 2024, and recycling over 65% of our water and eliminating all routine flaring by 2025. These environmental goals hit close to home as we hold the unique title of being the only publicly traded E&P headquartered in Midland, in the heart of the Permian Basin. As such, we feel an enormous social responsibility to better the community in which we live, work and play. We recently committed $2.5 million to a complete redesign of Midland\u2019s largest public park as well as $500,000 for Midlands Meals on Wheels program. Arguably more important, however, our employees continue to give their time to sponsor and host camps, reading and instructional programs and public work projects. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our team\u2019s efforts. 2021 is a great year for the company. We generated record free cash flow and distributed over 30% of it to shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet by substantially reducing our absolute debt load and continued to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in the industry. Looking ahead, we are confident in continued consistent operational execution and the ability to generate peer-leading returns. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, Travis and team. I wanted to just get some broader thoughts on your plan, Travis, to allocate free cash flow in 2022, obviously, have buybacks, variable dividends and debt, while I\u2019m assuming you want to keep some powder dry for A&D opportunities. But with the stock trading above the valuation of the stock, assuming a mid-cycle deck, we think you\u2019re probably going to pivot a little bit more to variable dividends, but I wanted to get your thoughts on that and how the $4 billion, if the strip holds could be allocated this year?\nTravis Stice: Sure. Arun, it\u2019s good visiting with you again. Listen, I\u2019ll tell you to the penny how much on share repurchases we bought in May, if any. But what hasn\u2019t changed, Arun, is our commitment. Whatever portion of our free cash flow that we don\u2019t spend on repurchases, we\u2019re going to return that free cash flow to our shareholders. Look, when it comes to share repurchasing, we view that as just like any other investment decision, drill a well, M&A activity. We do so, like you mentioned, at a mid-cycle oil price, which for us is around $60 a barrel. And it has to generate a positive return. And when you go back and look at what oil price has averaged since the fall of 2014 has averaged $53 a barrel. And if you can guarantee me that the price of oil is going to be $90 or above, then I\u2019ll tell you that our shares are undervalued. But we\u2019re going to be disciplined. We\u2019re going to be opportunistic when it comes to our share repurchase programs just like any other form of capital allocation and what we don\u2019t repurchase in shares we\u2019re going to return back to our shareholders in the variable dividend every quarter.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I think on top of that, Arun, we certainly want a fortress balance sheet. I think there\u2019s some stuff for us to do with our 2024 and 2025 notes this year, pay down debt when things are good. And I think that could open the door for higher returns. I think the key is 50% of free cash flow is going back to the shareholders. And if we don\u2019t have anything to do with the other 50%, it\u2019s coming back as well and we proved that in the fourth quarter.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And I had one follow-up on the Permian in general. Just thinking about the industry, what are the potential headwinds for future growth will be gas takeaway, current scrapes are just around 14 Bcf a day. We estimate there is about 17 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. So I wanted to get your thoughts, Travis, your net production is approaching 0.5 B and how do you think Diamondback is positioned to manage this tightness that could occur in late 2023 or early 2024?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I mean I think, Arun, unlike the past, I think we have the size and scale now to contribute to pipelines and make sure it happens. We\u2019re certainly doing our part, not growing. I wish other people would grow less in the Permian too but that\u2019s a different topic. But generally, we committed to the Whistler pipeline, just announced that this -- with this earnings. And that was with our WTG commitment on gas gathering and processing, committed to the BANGL pipeline, which is NGL takeaway. And really just trying to put our balance sheet to work to make sure pipeline capacity is strong coming out of the basin. I think we\u2019ll see some announcements here pretty soon. Saw a couple of things last week on new pipes, but I think generally the industry is aligned that we can\u2019t go back to the way we were when it comes to flaring. And particularly with gas prices up, we should all be incentivized to make sure gas flows out of the Permian. So it\u2019s going to be tight if growth continues through 2023, but I\u2019m pretty optimistic on 2024.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. So are you looking to add capacity on those two pipes, one of the two pipes?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, we would. You have to have taken kind rights to be able to do that. And so we\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on our midstream partners to either relinquish our taking kind rights to us so that we can contribute to the pipeline like we did on the Whistler pipe, putting our balance sheet to work or incentivizing them to contribute themselves. So -- that\u2019s a little bit of a game of chicken with our G&P\u2019s. But I think message is we both need to figure this out as a group and we would be willing to put our balance sheet to work to make it happen.\nArun Jayaram: Great thanks a lot.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thank you, Arun.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Your next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team and congratulations to everyone on the new promotions over at Diamondback. The first question is the hedging strategy. Travis, you talked about a long-term $60 WTI view, curve\u2019s obviously trading well through that. Does it make sense to opportunistically layer in hedging and thereby lock in more of the capital returns? Or do you think, given the strength of balance sheet, you can run the business more open?\nTravis Stice: As our balance sheet strengthens, I think your comment about running the business a little bit more open makes sense. But having said that, though, we have to make sure that we protect the extreme downside. Look, the impossible happened in 2020. While we don\u2019t ever think that\u2019s going to happen again, we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got insurance to provide accordingly. I think we try to do deferred premium puts as our preferred hedging strategy, which kind of sets that protection in place for us while accomplishing, giving our shareholders all the upside on price as well.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I mean we hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And preparing for the worst is buying puts at $50. The balance sheet doesn\u2019t blow out, dividend is well protected, still our free cash flow above that and try to leave as much upside for the best as possible.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. That makes sense. The follow-up is Travis, you famously said, I think it was last August that your view was it was a seller\u2019s market. And stock has obviously done very well since then and your equity value has strengthened. What\u2019s your thought on the M&A environment in the Permian? Do you view Diamondback as a logical consolidator. And how do you think about the time line of that, especially with oil above mid-cycle prices?\nTravis Stice: Yes, Neil, that\u2019s a good question. And it\u2019s really hard for me to see how kind of the excess of G&A that still exists in the Permian, how all of that gets consolidated. I wish I could articulate clearly what the catalyst is going to be that allows consolidation to occur, because it\u2019s needed in our industry. That being said, there\u2019s a lot of companies that had one foot in the -- whistling through the graveyard with one foot in the grave. And now a couple of years later, oil is at $90 a barrel and they\u2019re expecting to sell out and get value on future cash flows at $90 a barrel. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s the same strategy on our share buybacks, right? If the mid-cycle oil price is $60 a barrel, then it\u2019s going to be hard to close the spread between bid and ask on the much-needed M&A activity that has to occur here in the Permian. So, while I\u2019d like to think Diamondback could create unreasonable value for our shareholders, like we did with the QEP and Guidon acquisition. It\u2019s hard with these frothy expectations on the oil price that we\u2019re seeing today.\nNeil Mehta: No, that\u2019s very clear. Thank you, Travis, Kaes.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Your next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning guys, thanks for the time. My question maybe for you, Kaes, is my first, a little different angle on shareholder return. What I\u2019d say there is -- while I\u2019m glad to see you all have really not gotten caught in this group think of suggestion you have to pay out all your free cash flow. The question I\u2019m getting from the investors is, how do you all think you got to show investors that you\u2019ll continue to be the best allocators of capital that you have. And Kaes you mentioned anything is out there on a lot of possibilities with one of those allocation choices at some point include higher production.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Neil, good question. I think the Street has lost sight of value creation for E&Ps. I get that there\u2019s a lot of cash going back to shareholders. But at the end of the day, if you can generate more free cash flow with the same expectations out of the business, you\u2019re creating more value over a long period of time. Execution is going to matter, metrics matter, controlling cost matters, PDP F&D matters. And for us, all of those inputs create more free cash flow, and that means more free cash flow is going to shareholders, whether it\u2019s 50% of free cash flow in one quarter or 67% and another. We kind of think about this as a partnership. It\u2019s just that the partnership has a commitment to return 50% of free cash flow if we have something to do with the other 50% that creates unreasonable value, we\u2019ll keep it. But we\u2019re not going to sit on cash and we\u2019re going to distribute a ton of cash to partners. Just the only commitment is at least 50% of that cash is coming back.\nNeal Dingmann: Great to hear. And then Travis, my second question, probably for you is, I like the Slides 10 and 11 on margins and costs. I\u2019m just wondering specifically, can you give maybe a little more color on the primary driver of that leading cash margin. I mean is it that sort of newish 10-day drilling well design that\u2019s driving that? Or maybe just talk about what you would primarily point to.\nTravis Stice: Yes, certainly, we\u2019ve got the benefit of the improvements that we made in 2021, as I mentioned, 35% improvement in drill times, and we\u2019re going to get a full year impact of that this year, which is helping us offset the inflationary effects. A couple of data points, Neal, that -- we just -- I just find out about yesterday as we\u2019re getting updated in our weekly meeting, we drilled a well in the Delaware Basin. It\u2019s a 15,000-foot lateral. We drilled it to TD in nine days, which was a record for us and for that area, just an outstanding occurrence. And even on the Midland Basin side, we\u2019ve been drilling the most. We drilled another three-mile lateral, a 15,000-foot lateral in seven and a half days. But what\u2019s amazing about that, and that\u2019s to TD. What\u2019s amazing about that is we don\u2019t spend three and a half days in the lateral. Now we used a rotary steerable and sometimes rotary steerable technology is a little harder to replicate. But that\u2019s what\u2019s possible. So, we\u2019ve got an organization Neal that continues to lean into this variable expense side. And what I can emphasize enough is that that\u2019s ground that\u2019s taken and never given back. When you become more efficient at something that\u2019s always on your side of the table, and it\u2019s for the good guys. So, I know kind of -- that\u2019s a little bit off topic there, but it\u2019s really important to hear that our organization is locked and loaded, and this machine is humming very, very efficiently. And you couldn\u2019t want more -- you couldn\u2019t want a machine humming more efficiently than we are right now in an inflationary environment.\nNeal Dingmann: No, I always want to hear those updates. Thanks Travis, thanks, Kaes.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Neal.\nOperator: Your next question is from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning all. Congrats on your quarter and update.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thank you, Derrick.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: With my first question, I wanted to focus on the flaring you experienced in Q4. With the full understanding of its importance to you based on your ESG mandate and incentive compensation. Could you speak to the higher-than-expected flaring you experienced? And what steps you guys can take to mitigate that in the future even with your partners?\nTravis Stice: Yes. If you look on Slide 18, Derrick, we laid it out with quite a bit of detail. And just as an aside, you\u2019ve heard me say this before, our Board expects management to not only lead the industry in environmental measures, but also lead the industry in disclosure. And I think 18 is a pretty good slide. But let me just point to something specifically. If you look in the top right of that slide, it talks about flaring by source. And if you take third-party planned maintenance and third-party unplanned maintenance, that\u2019s 80% of our flaring volumes in 2021. And particularly on the unplanned side, which is something that we\u2019ve just got to do a better job with our business partners on. Now, I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve actually changed contracts where we can that both incentivizes and penalizes flaring performance. So, we\u2019re looking to expand that concept across all of our gatherers, but we\u2019re also intentionally asking our midstream gatherers to help us as an industry on this effort. And that\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019re calling attention to this to their performance on Slide 18. Now, particular to the miss, I tried to lay that out, we set the goal for our flaring before we bought QEP and Guidon. And we didn\u2019t adjust our goal just because we acquired assets that had much worse flaring statistics than we did. We tried to absorb it. We did absorb it, but it cost us on our annual performance. But that\u2019s -- we felt like that was the right way to treat it. Once the goal is set, we honor it.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. One thing to add is, we also deferred half a million barrels of oil last year. I mean we\u2019re trying to do our part here, Derrick. We deferred 850,000 BOEs, half a million barrels of oil because of flaring. We\u2019re just kind of asking that both sides, midstream and upstream get together to solve this industry issue.\nTravis Stice: And that shouldn\u2019t be lost, Derrick. That\u2019s a very key point. Think about that. We deferred over a half a million barrels last year just to avoid flaring. And that\u2019s a behavior that represents a substantial pivot for Diamondback and a substantial pivot if our peers follow suit for our industry. And what I believe you\u2019re seeing, Derrick, is you\u2019re seeing environmental stewardship more of -- more companies are viewing it as an operating philosophy as opposed to an expense, which it was historically or hit the volumes. And I think that\u2019s an important narrative for our industry to get out there and push as an operating philosophy, environmental stewardship, particularly around eliminating flaring and eliminating methane emissions is simply the way to operate a business on a full cycle basis. And I hope that makes sense.\nDerrick Whitfield: It does. And your commitment to it, it\u2019s quite clear. As my follow-up, I wanted to dig in a bit more on the macro side and ask if you could share your expectations for growth in the Permian in 2022 and ask if the growth rates outlined by the majors in the Permian if that\u2019s a concern for you?\nTravis Stice: Well, look, I pointed out that on a global sense, the supply-demand is pretty tenuous. And even with the announced growth from the majors, I\u2019m not sure that the total barrels that they\u2019re producing are growing into the global equation. So that\u2019s kind of a plus. Now, right here to look out my window, I know that the Permian is running about 300 rigs right now. We\u2019re probably on the way to 350 rigs or 400 rigs by the end of this year. And a large portion of that -- of those rigs have been operated by Permian. But I think some of the growth you\u2019re seeing on a go-forward basis will be from the majors. We\u2019ve already talked about gas pipeline takeaway issues and a little bit on the NGLs, which I think Diamondback has been on our front foot, getting some strategic alliances there, and oil take away is in great shape, but it is going to create inflationary pressures. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re charged to us and all of our industry\u2019s charge is how to manage CapEx in an inflationary environment and not put your shareholder return program at risk. That\u2019s kind of how I think about the total Permian playbook.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And you guys have done a great job with that. So thanks again for your time.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nOperator: Your next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Thank you. Good morning everybody. Guys, post the deals, I guess, the cleanup of last year, it looks like you\u2019ve gone through a little bit of an inventory high grading on your latest disclosure. I just wonder if you could kind of walk us through what that looked like. It looks to us that you\u2019re sitting on about a better than 15-year inventory if you define just the core of that slightly longer lateral inventory you laid out today. So, can you just walk us through what that process was, and if I\u2019m thinking about it the right way?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I mean, generally, Doug, post the deals we do a lot of trades to try to block up, extend inventory, extend laterals, sometimes at the expense of lower working interest inventory that may not be operated or have shorter laterals. So that\u2019s the blocking and tackling piece that we\u2019re very focused on. And second, on inventory, we\u2019ve gone a little wider in both the Midland and the Delaware Basins. I think our updated inventory numbers reflect that in kind of moving towards six wells to seven wells per zone per section in the Midland Basin versus kind of eight being the tightest 660-foot spacing. And the Delaware move into kind of four wells to five wells a section in the primary zones versus six wells. I think what we found is we\u2019re not sacrificing a ton of EUR from that unit by going a little wider, but we are generating much better returns and much better capital efficiency. So, I think the offset from a present value perspective outweighs the loss of a couple of locations.\nDoug Leggate: So is it the right way to think about this on if you guys maintain your ex growth outlook, we\u2019re looking at better than 15 years of drilling. I mean, obviously, I know it\u2019s a little bit too precise. But I\u2019m trying to just think about the longevity of the portfolio strategy with the inventory you have today.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, that\u2019s fair. I will add that -- it\u2019s a small number, but we are completing five less wells at the midpoint in 2022 than we were in 2021. And as the base decline shallows out and we get active on sale of Robertson Ranch, where we have a significant percentage of minerals helping us out, that capital efficiency is going to look a little better here over the coming years.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. My follow-up, I hate to do it, but it\u2019s the variable dividend buyback, balance sheet question. When you pay out a variable, the cash is gone at the top of the cycle, let\u2019s say, M&A opportunities fall by the wayside, let\u2019s assume then you get a correction in oil prices and the cash has been paid out as a variable. I\u2019m just kind of curious, your commentary, you mentioned variable has differentiated you, that you haven\u2019t gone down that path. What should we take from those comments as to how you\u2019re prioritizing setting cash on the balance sheet, continuing to buy back stock if you see intrinsic value or indeed giving out a variable dividend that you don\u2019t really get a chance to get back?\nTravis Stice: Yes. So it\u2019s really pretty straightforward, Doug. It\u2019s lean into the base dividend, which we\u2019ve shown every quarter since we initiated the dividend back in 2018. And we\u2019re going to get that up to $3 a share if the market conditions don\u2019t change. The second is share repurchases. But again, there\u2019s a calculus that\u2019s involved in an investment decision for share repurchases. So to the extent we can consume 50% of our free cash flow at a good return on share repurchases then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. But if we see a dislocation between commodity price, share repurchases, we\u2019ll pivot quickly within the quarter to pay out the remaining, up to 50% -- or at least 50% of the free cash flow in the form of a variable dividend. So in some quarters, it\u2019s at least going to be 50%. And in some quarters, it could be as much as like we did this last quarter, 67% or more. But we\u2019re just trying to maintain at the end of the day, Doug, we\u2019re trying to maintain the greatest flexibility to generate the best shareholder return.\nDoug Leggate: Travis, I apologize. What do you do with the other 50%? You did 67% in the fourth quarter?\nTravis Stice: Well, right now, we\u2019d like to continue to work on having a fortress balance sheet and having cash on that fortress balance sheet for an inevitable down cycle. So, I think we\u2019re focused on kind of our mid-decade maturities if we can extend some of them, but also pay down most of them. That clears the way for a lot more cash to be put on the balance sheet and then step up the overall shareholder return from there. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we\u2019re there yet, Doug.\nDoug Leggate: Thanks, Travis.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Deckelbaum with Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good morning guys. Thanks for the time this morning.\nTravis Stice: Hi, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Just wanted to revisit that last point on the balance sheet. You talked about the mid-decade maturities. Is there -- can you remind us, is there an absolute sort of debt target that you have if you\u2019re factoring in a $60 mid-cycle price?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I kind of think about absolute getting down to $3.5 billion-ish at Diamondback and $1 billion-ish at the subs. So $4.5 million total. I think that keeps you very well protected even at a mid-cycle price turn or so. But more importantly, average maturity getting extended is going to be important because that clears the way for more shareholder returns between now and 2029 when our next big note would be due.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate that. And then just my second question. The slide where you were referencing cost inflation looked like it rolled up to about 15% overall. The reference point was the third quarter of 2020, where I think we were paying people to stick oil in swimming pools. So 15% seems relatively benign since then. I\u2019m curious what your outlook is on what you can do and what you\u2019re factoring in, in terms of cost inflation into the 2023, 2024 time line. And would you \u2013 do you think that there\u2019s still room to offset that with efficiencies? And are you changing how you\u2019re contracting for services right now?\nTravis Stice: Well, you always want your organization to continue to look for the efficiencies on the variable side. And it\u2019s hard to forecast what those are. But it\u2019s not hard to try to incentivize the culture that looks for those efficiency gains. And what they\u2019re going to look like in 2023 and 2024, I can\u2019t tell you, but I know we\u2019re going to continue to look for it. And I know if past performance is a good indication, we\u2019ll continue to lead the back on these type of efficiencies. Contracting long term for more of the consumables on the fixed side of the equation, those have typically been very difficult for our industry because the time that the operator wants to lock in is the time that the service provider doesn\u2019t. We\u2019re always at odds and ends of the spectrum. So like right now, the consumable guys on the service side would love to lock in these all-time high prices. Operators are reluctant to do so. So Diamondback has the size and the scale to have very meaningful conversation with our business partners on the service side. And we have those quarterly or every six months. And that\u2019s the way that we\u2019ve chosen to manage that relationship. And most of our service providers we\u2019ve had now for over five years, and we\u2019ve got a really good business relationship with them. Look, their margins have to expand. We understand that. But our commitment to be best-in-class and the highest margin remains unchanged as well, too. So it\u2019s not a straightforward calculus, David, that I can lay out for you. But I can tell you that the organization will we continue to lean into it. And I\u2019m very confident certainly for 2022 that we\u2019ll be able to do so.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: And one comment on Slide 10, David. Slide 10 tells you exactly what we\u2019re saying, right? The rig line and the stimulation line, rig rates are up, frac rates are up, but the efficiencies that have been gained as seen in the top half of the page means that those pieces of the well costs have not risen like fixed costs like fuel or cement or casing.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Absolutely, and thanks for pointing that out and congrats on all the promotions. Thanks for the answers.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thanks, David.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor Pickering Holt.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just one for me on ESG. Obviously, a lot of progress made on the initiatives that you set out in September with your sustainability report just looking at that section of the slide deck that you highlighted. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about what you\u2019re focused on this year. I know you hit on flaring already. And then thinking further out, it would be interesting to hear about what sort of projects you could see yourselves investing in and continue to make progress on offsetting emissions.\nTravis Stice: Yes. We\u2019ve been pretty clear that we\u2019re committing, I don\u2019t know, $20 million or so per year for the next several years to eliminate flaring and to significantly reduce methane emissions. And tactically, that\u2019s translated on the methane side to overhauling and reconfiguring a lot of our old, mostly acquired tank batteries that have gas pneumatics. I think we\u2019ve got a slide in there that actually points that out. Yes. Gas pneumatics, you can see what that is on Slides 19 and 20. But that\u2019s been the first focus area is the gas pneumatics. And Danny, we\u2019re probably halfway through getting those batteries changed, third to halfway through?\nDanny Wesson: Yes. We kind of laid out the framework to get through them all in three to four years, a couple of years ago. So we\u2019re about halfway through with the battery upgrades and still working on leak detection and repair initiatives, and then flaring is our main drivers of methane emissions.\nTravis Stice: And then Jeff, on methane emissions, there\u2019s just an amazing amount of innovative technology that\u2019s coming out from the service side. And we\u2019re not \u2013 we haven\u2019t picked a winner yet. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s been a clear winner, but our approach has been to field test all of them. We\u2019ve probably got five or six leading edge technology methane sensors in the field in order to monitor these things, monitor methane emissions in real time. So we\u2019re investing alongside these technology companies on methane emissions. And then as Danny mentioned, flaring is something we\u2019re really leaning hard into and I can\u2019t emphasize enough that we can do everything we can on our side, but if we don\u2019t get our midstream partners on the G&P side to participate it\u2019s going to be very difficult for our industry to meet our goal of reducing or eliminating routine flaring as defined by the World Bank. So there is a reason we\u2019re being pointed in our presentation today about asking to work collaboratively with our G&P partners on the flaring side.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Great. Thank you.\nDanny Wesson: Thanks, Jeoff.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nitin Kumar of Wells Fargo.\nNitin Kumar: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of ground has been covered on the cash return side. But I want to check on the base dividend. You mentioned earlier that it could be about 25% of free cash flow of the return portion of free cash flow in 2022. How are you thinking about it beyond the $3 per share. Is that a good limit? Or could we see more increases in what would drive that?\nTravis Stice: Well, it really depends on what the market conditions look like at that point. I mean we can\u2019t continue to grow at 10% per quarter forever, right? At $3 a share, that\u2019s over $500 million a year of financial debt is how I look at it. So I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a limit, but I\u2019m saying that, that\u2019s certainly what our near-term focus is to get to that $3 a share.\nNitin Kumar: And I guess what I was asking was is there a percentage of cash flow that you\u2019re targeting or something like that at a mid-cycle price? Like how do you come up with that level?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. We look at it more on the breakeven side. So pre-dividend breakeven right now, $30 a barrel. I think that number stays fairly consistent here over the coming years as capital efficiency stays strong, base declines are reduced. And then above that, our large shareholders universally have said they want a base dividend that\u2019s protected below $40 oil. Right now, the base dividend was protected at $35. That will go up over time, but you also might have less shares over time, less debt. So that frees up some more cash to go to the dividend. But overall, cash returns have been widely discussed over the last couple of quarters. And the only thing we have universally heard from large long-owned leases more base dividend sooner. And that\u2019s why Travis is making a commitment to get to three by year-end with Board support, should conditions remain.\nNitin Kumar: Got it. And Travis, very quick question here, but you \u2013 I think you mentioned 400 rigs in the Permian in a year or so. We\u2019ve talked here a little bit about Permian takeaway on the gas and NGL side. But what are the other challenges that the basin could face if we do see that kind of growth? And how are you positioned to be ahead of that?\nTravis Stice: Well, I think if you\u2019re asking what are some of those constraints going to be if you get to 400 and what Diamondback is doing to prepare for that? Well, again, a part of it goes back to the long-standing relationship we have with our service partners. But secondarily, anything that requires boots or tires in the Permian Basin is going to continue to be tight. And that means we\u2019re going to have to attract \u2013 as an industry, we\u2019re going to have to attract more workers into the Permian Basin like we did in 2018, 2019. And that\u2019s going to \u2013 you\u2019re going to see that translate to an increase in labor costs. But again, those cost increases are going to paint pretty much all of us with the same brush. And we\u2019ll focus, like I tried to highlight earlier, we\u2019ll focus on the variable side, things we can actually do something about. But 400, what do we peak at Danny, out here in the Permian.\nDanny Wesson: Particularly like 490, and we exited pre-pandemic around 400 rigs.\nTravis Stice: So we\u2019re \u2013 even though I think those rigs are a little bit more efficient today than they were then, we\u2019re approaching or will approach by the end of this year sort of where we were at the end of 2019.\nNitin Kumar: Okay. Thanks for the answers guys.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Nitin.\nDanny Wesson: Thanks, Nitin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc.\nLeo Mariani: Hi guys. I just wanted to ask a question on the potential for FANG to return to a little bit of production growth at some point. You clearly mentioned that here in 2022 with the looming threat of Iranian barrels it was certainly one of the key issues that was keeping you guys away from growing. And also, based on your comments, maybe we\u2019re not quite back to pre-pandemic demand but we\u2019re very close. So as we look into next year, if we are above pre-pandemic demand levels and the Iranian situation has resolved itself one way or the other, could that be the time where maybe we see some modest growth from FANG? And how do you think about what the right level of growth is eventually?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I don\u2019t know what the right level of growth will be or when it\u2019s going to occur. I can tell you definitively right now, what\u2019s being valued by our investors is a shareholder return program. And no one wants to see that shareholder return program put at risk with volume growth, not for Diamondback specifically for our industry in total. So look, the world will be calling for oil growth at some point in the future. And our industry is going to have to figure out the right way to respond while not putting the shareholder return program at risk. We\u2019ve spent the last decade consuming capital and now we\u2019ve got a little bit of sunshine in us where we can return that capital to our investors that have been waiting patiently and sometimes impatiently for this return. So it\u2019s a good question to ask, Leo, but I can \u2013 I can\u2019t give you the time at which Diamondback or the industry is going to respond to growth. But I\u2019ll tell you, when we do, it\u2019s going to be in conjunction with creating unreasonable value for our shareholders.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: If we do.\nTravis Stice: If we do.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Understood. And I just wanted to ask quickly on the 2022 guidance here. Maybe just starting with the CapEx. It\u2019s a fairly good range, $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion you did describe having a percentage of some of the services locked in for the year here. So just definitely wanted to get your thoughts on kind of what the $150 million variability could be here in 2022? Because it sounds like you\u2019re not going to change the program and there really won\u2019t be production growth. And then just additionally, looking at the production side of the guidance. If my math is right, it looks like you guys either were kind of the very high end of the oil every quarter in 2021 or actually beat it. So as you\u2019re kind of looking at that guide in 2022, should we be thinking that you always have a slight bit of conservatism to allow for things that could go wrong in the field. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the production and CapEx guide in 2022.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: I think we always take a little conservatism for the good guys into our plan. Drilling and completing 280 wells at the \u2013 at your AFE number for a year is not an easy task. It might look easy for me in my Excel model but actually doing it in the field is pretty darn impressive. So we certainly want to give some room for guys to do what they do in the field, but also service costs are going up. I mean, Travis mentioned a very high rig count number in the Permian. If that number comes to fruition, there\u2019s going to be pressure on all the variable costs and the fixed cost in this basin. So fortunately, we have the 12 rigs we need. We have the three simul-frac crews we need. This is not a year where we need to go find eight crews \u2013 or eight rigs and three crews. We might have to pay them a little more to keep working for us, but that\u2019s the risk for the high end in the back half of the year.\nLeo Mariani: Okay, it\u2019s definitely helpful. Thanks guys.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thanks, Leo.\nOperator: Your next question is from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Travis and Kaes and the rest of the team there.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Travis, this goes back to some of your earlier comments about the \u2013 really what seems like a linchpin for your strategy, this idea of a mid-cycle oil price, why is $60 the right price?\nTravis Stice: Yes. We asked that question every day. But one of the things that\u2019s \u2013 when I ask that question, one of the responses I got was, what do you think the average price was for the last seven years, and that\u2019s $53 a barrel. It\u2019s really easy to get you fork about $90-plus oil. And in fact, I\u2019ve seen \u2013 I think I\u2019m seeing some of that for you in our industry right now, certainly in the commentary that\u2019s out there. But we know geopolitically, there\u2019s dollars that are in today\u2019s oil price that God willing will be resolved without arms conflict. We know that there\u2019s Iranian barrels that are probably coming on, I said, by the end of the year, but it may be at the end of this month. And we\u2019ve got this further in the Permian Basin that\u2019s continuing to lift U.S. production forecast. And while OPEC hasn\u2019t performed up to their 400,000 barrels per day per month production increases, but I think they\u2019re getting closer to it. And I don\u2019t know what their surplus is, but it\u2019s not zero yet. So all of those things, to me, you add them together actually seem to be a little bit more bearish for crude than it does to be optimistic. And the other thing is if we\u2019re wrong and oil price is higher, we\u2019re going to generate a lot of free cash flow, and our investors are going to get a lot of that return to them. And if I\u2019m right, then we\u2019ve protected our investments, and we\u2019ve made the right decisions. So $60, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a hard and fast number, but it\u2019s kind of the aperture at which we start all of our decisions on investments, whether it\u2019s M&A or drilling wells or share buybacks.\nCharles Meade: That\u2019s helpful, Travis. It seems as good as any other number to me. I just wanted to hear more of your thinking. Quick follow-up. I noticed that you guys said you drilled \u2013 or I think we\u2019ve drilled and completed a Barnett well in the quarter. Was that on the \u2013 I\u2019m guessing that was on the Limelight acreage. And is there any kind of rate of change there that was worth highlighting?\nDanny Wesson: Yes. We drilled a couple of wells there. I think we have a couple of planned this year. It\u2019s still early in the testing phase, but at $90 oil, it certainly competes even at $60 oil, including the low entry cost, it competes on a full cycle basis, but not yet does it compete with our core Midland and Delaware Basin position.\nTravis Stice: And I think one add is to that is that right now, we\u2019re drilling single wells. And there\u2019s a huge cost inefficiency when you\u2019re drilling single wells trying to delineate a play. Once you move into full cycle development and you can drill at least four wells, simul-frac operations, and combine that with the efficient drilling operations, you can drive a lot of cost out of the equation, which raises the economics on a play like Limelight and actually makes us start to compete for our capital with the other items in our portfolio.\nCharles Meade: Got it. Thanks for the detail guys.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Charles.\nOperator: I will now turn it back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again to everyone listening today. If you\u2019ve got any questions, just reach out to us using the contact information provided.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s teleconference. At this time, you may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes. I think on top of that, Arun, we certainly want a fortress balance sheet. I think there's some stuff for us to do with our 2024 and 2025 notes this year, pay down debt when things are good. And I think that could open the door for higher returns. I think the key is 50% of free cash flow is going back to the shareholders. And if we don't have anything to do with the other 50%, it's coming back as well and we proved that in the fourth quarter. Yes, we would. You have to have taken kind rights to be able to do that. And so we're putting a lot of pressure on our midstream partners to either relinquish our taking kind rights to us so that we can contribute to the pipeline like we did on the Whistler pipe, putting our balance sheet to work or incentivizing them to contribute themselves. So -- that's a little bit of a game of chicken with our G&P's. But I think message is we both need to figure this out as a group and we would be willing to put our balance sheet to work to make it happen. Thank you, Arun. Yes. I mean we hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And preparing for the worst is buying puts at $50. The balance sheet doesn't blow out, dividend is well protected, still our free cash flow above that and try to leave as much upside for the best as possible. Thank you. Yes, Neil, good question. I think the Street has lost sight of value creation for E&Ps. I get that there's a lot of cash going back to shareholders. But at the end of the day, if you can generate more free cash flow with the same expectations out of the business, you're creating more value over a long period of time. Execution is going to matter, metrics matter, controlling cost matters, PDP F&D matters. And for us, all of those inputs create more free cash flow, and that means more free cash flow is going to shareholders, whether it's 50% of free cash flow in one quarter or 67% and another. We kind of think about this as a partnership. It's just that the partnership has a commitment to return 50% of free cash flow if we have something to do with the other 50% that creates unreasonable value, we'll keep it. But we're not going to sit on cash and we're going to distribute a ton of cash to partners. Just the only commitment is at least 50% of that cash is coming back. Thank you, Derrick. Yes. One thing to add is, we also deferred half a million barrels of oil last year. I mean we're trying to do our part here, Derrick. We deferred 850,000 BOEs, half a million barrels of oil because of flaring. We're just kind of asking that both sides, midstream and upstream get together to solve this industry issue. Yes. I mean, generally, Doug, post the deals we do a lot of trades to try to block up, extend inventory, extend laterals, sometimes at the expense of lower working interest inventory that may not be operated or have shorter laterals. So that's the blocking and tackling piece that we're very focused on. And second, on inventory, we've gone a little wider in both the Midland and the Delaware Basins. I think our updated inventory numbers reflect that in kind of moving towards six wells to seven wells per zone per section in the Midland Basin versus kind of eight being the tightest 660-foot spacing. And the Delaware move into kind of four wells to five wells a section in the primary zones versus six wells. I think what we found is we're not sacrificing a ton of EUR from that unit by going a little wider, but we are generating much better returns and much better capital efficiency. So, I think the offset from a present value perspective outweighs the loss of a couple of locations. Yes, that's fair. I will add that -- it's a small number, but we are completing five less wells at the midpoint in 2022 than we were in 2021. And as the base decline shallows out and we get active on sale of Robertson Ranch, where we have a significant percentage of minerals helping us out, that capital efficiency is going to look a little better here over the coming years. Yes. I kind of think about absolute getting down to $3.5 billion-ish at Diamondback and $1 billion-ish at the subs. So $4.5 million total. I think that keeps you very well protected even at a mid-cycle price turn or so. But more importantly, average maturity getting extended is going to be important because that clears the way for more shareholder returns between now and 2029 when our next big note would be due. And one comment on Slide 10, David. Slide 10 tells you exactly what we're saying, right? The rig line and the stimulation line, rig rates are up, frac rates are up, but the efficiencies that have been gained as seen in the top half of the page means that those pieces of the well costs have not risen like fixed costs like fuel or cement or casing. Thanks, David. Yes. We look at it more on the breakeven side. So pre-dividend breakeven right now, $30 a barrel. I think that number stays fairly consistent here over the coming years as capital efficiency stays strong, base declines are reduced. And then above that, our large shareholders universally have said they want a base dividend that's protected below $40 oil. Right now, the base dividend was protected at $35. That will go up over time, but you also might have less shares over time, less debt. So that frees up some more cash to go to the dividend. But overall, cash returns have been widely discussed over the last couple of quarters. And the only thing we have universally heard from large long-owned leases more base dividend sooner. And that's why Travis is making a commitment to get to three by year-end with Board support, should conditions remain. If we do. I think we always take a little conservatism for the good guys into our plan. Drilling and completing 280 wells at the \u2013 at your AFE number for a year is not an easy task. It might look easy for me in my Excel model but actually doing it in the field is pretty darn impressive.

We have the three simul-frac crews we need. This is not a year where we need to go find eight crews \u2013 or eight rigs and three crews. We might have to pay them a little more to keep working for us, but that's the risk for the high end in the back half of the year. Thanks, Leo."

            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. 2021 was a great year for Diamondback and our industry with higher product prices allowing the vast majority of our industry to one repair and improve balance sheets quickly; two, accelerate returns to shareholders; and three, make significant progress on environmental objectives. At Diamondback, we reduced our absolute debt by $1.3 billion, increased our base dividend every quarter, initiated a return of capital framework and announced ambitious environmental goals designed to help us earn our environmental license to operate. In the fourth quarter alone, buoyed by commodity price strength, Diamondback generated $772 million of free cash flow with production and capital both positively exceeding expectations. We returned 67% of this free cash flow to stockholders, which was above our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders quarterly. This return was made up of $106 million allocated to our growing base dividend, now at $2.40 a share on an annualized basis, which represents a current yield of approximately 2% and $409 million in share purchases as we bought back nearly 3.9 million shares at an average price of just under $106 per share. We are at the beginning of an incredible period of value creation for the industry. And I'm confident that the capital discipline demonstrated by us and our peers in 2021 will continue putting returns and therefore shareholders first. We believe this is the best near-term path to equity value creation as our shift from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital cements itself as our long-term business model. Two months into 2022, economies are rapidly reopening around the world stoking demand, which we believe to be close to if not above pre-pandemic levels. On the supply side, we are witnessing some underperformance from OPEC+ to meet this increasing demand, calling into question spare capacity with global inventory numbers now approaching 2010 to 2014 levels. We cited both global oil inventories and OPEC spare capacity as impediments to any discussion around U.S. public company oil growth, and those issues appear to have subsided for now. However, the global balance remains tenuous at best with up to a million barrels per day of additional Iranian barrels potentially coming online sometime this year and U.S. growth expectations continuing to climb higher led by private companies and more importantly or more recently measures. Both of these supply factors could be bearish signals for oil, therefore Diamondback's team and board believe that we have no reason to put growth before returns. Our shareholders, the owners of our company agreed. And as a result, we will continue to be disciplined, keeping our oil production flat this year. As such our plan for this year is simple. Maintain oil reduction of approximately 220,000 barrels per day by spending between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. At current strip pricing, this production and capital spend equates to nearly $4 billion of free cash flow, which to our returns framework gives a minimum of $2 billion of cash back to our investors. At the same time, we are committed to permanent returns to our investors, which is why we continue to lean into our base dividend, increasing it again by 20% this quarter. Our growing base dividend is our primary means of returning capital and we've increased it by quarterly CAGR of over 10%, since it was initiated in 2018. Today, we have line of sight to get our dividend to $3 a share by the end of this year, if market conditions remain favorable, which would mean 25% of our 2022 distributable free cash flow would be allocated through this constant predictable form of shareholder return. History has taught us that oil is a volatile commodity and that the macro environment will not always be this favorable. So we continue to work towards protecting our base dividend down to $35 WTI with a view that this dividend is really just a form of debt and if plus our maintenance capital budget have to be protected to the extreme downside. By continuing to focus on our fortress balance sheet and layering on our strategic derivative positions to our hedge book, we are confident in our ability to perform in any environment. While the base dividend is the primary tool of returning capital, we will also utilize share repurchases and potentially variable dividends to reach at least 50% of distributed free cash flow on a quarterly basis. We continue to repurchase shares opportunistically, taking advantage of volatility while generating returns on these repurchases well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices, which today is assumed to be around $60 WTI. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we've spent $430 million or 22% of the $2 billion program our Board authorized last September. If the free cash flow returned through our base dividend and repurchase program does not equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors hold by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend and most importantly allows at least 50% of free cash flow to be returned. However, it is important that the Board also retains discretion on what to do with the other 50% of the free cash flow generated. As was the case in the fourth quarter, we have the ability to distribute above and beyond our 50% threshold if we feel comfortable with our balance sheet and associated cash balance and do not have a use for excess cash, we will return that cash aggressively to shareholders. Some quarters, we will distribute 50% of free cash flow, but in others we will have the ability to return more, just like we did in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we fully expect to differentiate ourselves not only by our returns framework but more importantly through our consistent execution in the field. Last year, our clear fluid design lowered our average drilling days in the Midland Basin by approximately 35%. That's an astounding achievement for our drilling department. On the frac side, our simul-frac operations continue to reduce our time on pad as we are now averaging 3,200 feet per day with our four-well simul-frac design. As we've laid out in our investor deck, these operational efficiencies have helped us mitigate the substantial cost pressures we've seen related to consumables and labor and as we noted last quarter, these gains will be permanent, giving us more variable cost control than our peers due to these industry-leading drilling and completion times. Now when you bake in these cost increases and offset them with our efficiency gain, this equates to about 10% of additional capital spend year-over-year, which is baked into our guidance. We will try to offset this inflation by doing what we do best, innovating, implementing new technology and drilling more efficient and better wells. As mentioned, we were able to offset a vast majority of pricing increases we faced last year through this type of innovation. And we're confident we can maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure this year. At the same time, we are fortunate to have multiple pieces of our capital cost structure locked in with contracts and dedications like our water and sand supply. As the rig count in the Permian climbs, we will continue to work to control other components of our cost structure, particularly services, labor and consumable products while continuing to be the leader in cash margin and capital efficiency. Finally, I'd like to close by detailing the strides we've made in our environmental, social and governance practices. To begin, we met four of our five environmental goals in 2021, which had a 20% weighting in management's short-term compensation this year and included specific targets related to flaring, water recycling, GHG emission intensity, produced liquid spills and total recordable incidents. Unfortunately, we did not meet our expectation of flaring less than 1% of gross gas produced. While we met this goal on legacy Diamondback acreage, which was how the goal was set, we missed our target when incorporating our acquired QEP assets, which included the QEP Bakken asset we divested in October. We will continue to improve our takeaway on the acquired Permian acreage and partner with our midstream companies to not only structure contracts then incentivize takeaway in price-agnostic environments, but also apply performance-based incentives and penalties related to flaring. All of our progress in 2021 positions us well to hit our long-term goals of reducing our GHG and methane intensity by 50% and 70%, respectively, by 2024, and recycling over 65% of our water and eliminating all routine flaring by 2025. These environmental goals hit close to home as we hold the unique title of being the only publicly traded E&P headquartered in Midland, in the heart of the Permian Basin. As such, we feel an enormous social responsibility to better the community in which we live, work and play. We recently committed $2.5 million to a complete redesign of Midland's largest public park as well as $500,000 for Midlands Meals on Wheels program. Arguably more important, however, our employees continue to give their time to sponsor and host camps, reading and instructional programs and public work projects. I'm incredibly proud of our team's efforts. 2021 is a great year for the company. We generated record free cash flow and distributed over 30% of it to shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet by substantially reducing our absolute debt load and continued to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in the industry. Looking ahead, we are confident in continued consistent operational execution and the ability to generate peer-leading returns. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Sure. Arun, it's good visiting with you again. Listen, I'll tell you to the penny how much on share repurchases we bought in May, if any. But what hasn't changed, Arun, is our commitment. Whatever portion of our free cash flow that we don't spend on repurchases, we're going to return that free cash flow to our shareholders. Look, when it comes to share repurchasing, we view that as just like any other investment decision, drill a well, M&A activity. We do so, like you mentioned, at a mid-cycle oil price, which for us is around $60 a barrel. And it has to generate a positive return. And when you go back and look at what oil price has averaged since the fall of 2014 has averaged $53 a barrel. And if you can guarantee me that the price of oil is going to be $90 or above, then I'll tell you that our shares are undervalued. But we're going to be disciplined. We're going to be opportunistic when it comes to our share repurchase programs just like any other form of capital allocation and what we don't repurchase in shares we're going to return back to our shareholders in the variable dividend every quarter. Yes. I mean I think, Arun, unlike the past, I think we have the size and scale now to contribute to pipelines and make sure it happens. We're certainly doing our part, not growing. I wish other people would grow less in the Permian too but that's a different topic. But generally, we committed to the Whistler pipeline, just announced that this -- with this earnings. And that was with our WTG commitment on gas gathering and processing, committed to the BANGL pipeline, which is NGL takeaway. And really just trying to put our balance sheet to work to make sure pipeline capacity is strong coming out of the basin. I think we'll see some announcements here pretty soon. Saw a couple of things last week on new pipes, but I think generally the industry is aligned that we can't go back to the way we were when it comes to flaring. And particularly with gas prices up, we should all be incentivized to make sure gas flows out of the Permian. So it's going to be tight if growth continues through 2023, but I'm pretty optimistic on 2024. Thanks, Arun. As our balance sheet strengthens, I think your comment about running the business a little bit more open makes sense. But having said that, though, we have to make sure that we protect the extreme downside. Look, the impossible happened in 2020. While we don't ever think that's going to happen again, we want to make sure that we've got insurance to provide accordingly. I think we try to do deferred premium puts as our preferred hedging strategy, which kind of sets that protection in place for us while accomplishing, giving our shareholders all the upside on price as well. Yes, Neil, that's a good question. And it's really hard for me to see how kind of the excess of G&A that still exists in the Permian, how all of that gets consolidated. I wish I could articulate clearly what the catalyst is going to be that allows consolidation to occur, because it's needed in our industry. That being said, there's a lot of companies that had one foot in the -- whistling through the graveyard with one foot in the grave. And now a couple of years later, oil is at $90 a barrel and they're expecting to sell out and get value on future cash flows at $90 a barrel. And as I mentioned, it's the same strategy on our share buybacks, right? If the mid-cycle oil price is $60 a barrel, then it's going to be hard to close the spread between bid and ask on the much-needed M&A activity that has to occur here in the Permian. So, while I'd like to think Diamondback could create unreasonable value for our shareholders, like we did with the QEP and Guidon acquisition. It's hard with these frothy expectations on the oil price that we're seeing today. Thanks, Neil. Yes, certainly, we've got the benefit of the improvements that we made in 2021, as I mentioned, 35% improvement in drill times, and we're going to get a full year impact of that this year, which is helping us offset the inflationary effects. A couple of data points, Neal, that -- we just -- I just find out about yesterday as we're getting updated in our weekly meeting, we drilled a well in the Delaware Basin. It's a 15,000-foot lateral. We drilled it to TD in nine days, which was a record for us and for that area, just an outstanding occurrence. And even on the Midland Basin side, we've been drilling the most. We drilled another three-mile lateral, a 15,000-foot lateral in seven and a half days. But what's amazing about that, and that's to TD. What's amazing about that is we don't spend three and a half days in the lateral. Now we used a rotary steerable and sometimes rotary steerable technology is a little harder to replicate. But that's what's possible. So, we've got an organization Neal that continues to lean into this variable expense side. And what I can emphasize enough is that that's ground that's taken and never given back. When you become more efficient at something that's always on your side of the table, and it's for the good guys. So, I know kind of -- that's a little bit off topic there, but it's really important to hear that our organization is locked and loaded, and this machine is humming very, very efficiently. And you couldn't want more -- you couldn't want a machine humming more efficiently than we are right now in an inflationary environment. Thanks, Neal. Thanks, Derrick. Yes. If you look on Slide 18, Derrick, we laid it out with quite a bit of detail. And just as an aside, you've heard me say this before, our Board expects management to not only lead the industry in environmental measures, but also lead the industry in disclosure. And I think 18 is a pretty good slide. But let me just point to something specifically. If you look in the top right of that slide, it talks about flaring by source. And if you take third-party planned maintenance and third-party unplanned maintenance, that's 80% of our flaring volumes in 2021. And particularly on the unplanned side, which is something that we've just got to do a better job with our business partners on. Now, I said in my prepared remarks, we've actually changed contracts where we can that both incentivizes and penalizes flaring performance. So, we're looking to expand that concept across all of our gatherers, but we're also intentionally asking our midstream gatherers to help us as an industry on this effort. And that's part of the reason that we're calling attention to this to their performance on Slide 18. Now, particular to the miss, I tried to lay that out, we set the goal for our flaring before we bought QEP and Guidon. And we didn't adjust our goal just because we acquired assets that had much worse flaring statistics than we did. We tried to absorb it. We did absorb it, but it cost us on our annual performance. But that's -- we felt like that was the right way to treat it. Once the goal is set, we honor it. And that shouldn't be lost, Derrick. That's a very key point. Think about that. We deferred over a half a million barrels last year just to avoid flaring. And that's a behavior that represents a substantial pivot for Diamondback and a substantial pivot if our peers follow suit for our industry. And what I believe you're seeing, Derrick, is you're seeing environmental stewardship more of -- more companies are viewing it as an operating philosophy as opposed to an expense, which it was historically or hit the volumes. And I think that's an important narrative for our industry to get out there and push as an operating philosophy, environmental stewardship, particularly around eliminating flaring and eliminating methane emissions is simply the way to operate a business on a full cycle basis. And I hope that makes sense. Well, look, I pointed out that on a global sense, the supply-demand is pretty tenuous. And even with the announced growth from the majors, I'm not sure that the total barrels that they're producing are growing into the global equation. So that's kind of a plus. Now, right here to look out my window, I know that the Permian is running about 300 rigs right now. We're probably on the way to 350 rigs or 400 rigs by the end of this year. And a large portion of that -- of those rigs have been operated by Permian. But I think some of the growth you're seeing on a go-forward basis will be from the majors. We've already talked about gas pipeline takeaway issues and a little bit on the NGLs, which I think Diamondback has been on our front foot, getting some strategic alliances there, and oil take away is in great shape, but it is going to create inflationary pressures. But that's what you're charged to us and all of our industry's charge is how to manage CapEx in an inflationary environment and not put your shareholder return program at risk. That's kind of how I think about the total Permian playbook. Thank you, Derrick. Yes. So it's really pretty straightforward, Doug. It's lean into the base dividend, which we've shown every quarter since we initiated the dividend back in 2018. And we're going to get that up to $3 a share if the market conditions don't change. The second is share repurchases. But again, there's a calculus that's involved in an investment decision for share repurchases. So to the extent we can consume 50% of our free cash flow at a good return on share repurchases then that's what we'll do. But if we see a dislocation between commodity price, share repurchases, we'll pivot quickly within the quarter to pay out the remaining, up to 50% -- or at least 50% of the free cash flow in the form of a variable dividend. So in some quarters, it's at least going to be 50%. And in some quarters, it could be as much as like we did this last quarter, 67% or more. But we're just trying to maintain at the end of the day, Doug, we're trying to maintain the greatest flexibility to generate the best shareholder return. Well, right now, we'd like to continue to work on having a fortress balance sheet and having cash on that fortress balance sheet for an inevitable down cycle. So, I think we're focused on kind of our mid-decade maturities if we can extend some of them, but also pay down most of them. That clears the way for a lot more cash to be put on the balance sheet and then step up the overall shareholder return from there. But I don't think it's something we're there yet, Doug. Thanks, Doug. Hi, David. Well, you always want your organization to continue to look for the efficiencies on the variable side. And it's hard to forecast what those are. But it's not hard to try to incentivize the culture that looks for those efficiency gains. And what they're going to look like in 2023 and 2024, I can't tell you, but I know we're going to continue to look for it. And I know if past performance is a good indication, we'll continue to lead the back on these type of efficiencies. Contracting long term for more of the consumables on the fixed side of the equation, those have typically been very difficult for our industry because the time that the operator wants to lock in is the time that the service provider doesn't. We're always at odds and ends of the spectrum. So like right now, the consumable guys on the service side would love to lock in these all-time high prices. Operators are reluctant to do so. So Diamondback has the size and the scale to have very meaningful conversation with our business partners on the service side. And we have those quarterly or every six months. And that's the way that we've chosen to manage that relationship. And most of our service providers we've had now for over five years, and we've got a really good business relationship with them. Look, their margins have to expand. We understand that. But our commitment to be best-in-class and the highest margin remains unchanged as well, too. So it's not a straightforward calculus, David, that I can lay out for you. But I can tell you that the organization will we continue to lean into it. And I'm very confident certainly for 2022 that we'll be able to do so. Thanks, David. Yes. We've been pretty clear that we're committing, I don't know, $20 million or so per year for the next several years to eliminate flaring and to significantly reduce methane emissions. And tactically, that's translated on the methane side to overhauling and reconfiguring a lot of our old, mostly acquired tank batteries that have gas pneumatics. I think we've got a slide in there that actually points that out. Yes. Gas pneumatics, you can see what that is on Slides 19 and 20. But that's been the first focus area is the gas pneumatics. And Danny, we're probably halfway through getting those batteries changed, third to halfway through? And then Jeff, on methane emissions, there's just an amazing amount of innovative technology that's coming out from the service side. And we're not \u2013 we haven't picked a winner yet. I don't know that there's been a clear winner, but our approach has been to field test all of them. We've probably got five or six leading edge technology methane sensors in the field in order to monitor these things, monitor methane emissions in real time. So we're investing alongside these technology companies on methane emissions. And then as Danny mentioned, flaring is something we're really leaning hard into and I can't emphasize enough that we can do everything we can on our side, but if we don't get our midstream partners on the G&P side to participate it's going to be very difficult for our industry to meet our goal of reducing or eliminating routine flaring as defined by the World Bank. So there is a reason we're being pointed in our presentation today about asking to work collaboratively with our G&P partners on the flaring side. Well, it really depends on what the market conditions look like at that point. I mean we can't continue to grow at 10% per quarter forever, right? At $3 a share, that's over $500 million a year of financial debt is how I look at it. So I'm not saying that's a limit, but I'm saying that, that's certainly what our near-term focus is to get to that $3 a share. Well, I think if you're asking what are some of those constraints going to be if you get to 400 and what Diamondback is doing to prepare for that? Well, again, a part of it goes back to the long-standing relationship we have with our service partners. But secondarily, anything that requires boots or tires in the Permian Basin is going to continue to be tight. And that means we're going to have to attract \u2013 as an industry, we're going to have to attract more workers into the Permian Basin like we did in 2018, 2019. And that's going to \u2013 you're going to see that translate to an increase in labor costs. But again, those cost increases are going to paint pretty much all of us with the same brush. And we'll focus, like I tried to highlight earlier, we'll focus on the variable side, things we can actually do something about. But 400, what do we peak at Danny, out here in the Permian. So we're \u2013 even though I think those rigs are a little bit more efficient today than they were then, we're approaching or will approach by the end of this year sort of where we were at the end of 2019. Thanks, Nitin. Yes. I don't know what the right level of growth will be or when it's going to occur. I can tell you definitively right now, what's being valued by our investors is a shareholder return program. And no one wants to see that shareholder return program put at risk with volume growth, not for Diamondback specifically for our industry in total. So look, the world will be calling for oil growth at some point in the future. And our industry is going to have to figure out the right way to respond while not putting the shareholder return program at risk. We've spent the last decade consuming capital and now we've got a little bit of sunshine in us where we can return that capital to our investors that have been waiting patiently and sometimes impatiently for this return. So it's a good question to ask, Leo, but I can \u2013 I can't give you the time at which Diamondback or the industry is going to respond to growth. But I'll tell you, when we do, it's going to be in conjunction with creating unreasonable value for our shareholders. If we do. Good morning, Charles. Yes. We asked that question every day. But one of the things that's \u2013 when I ask that question, one of the responses I got was, what do you think the average price was for the last seven years, and that's $53 a barrel. It's really easy to get you fork about $90-plus oil. And in fact, I've seen \u2013 I think I'm seeing some of that for you in our industry right now, certainly in the commentary that's out there. But we know geopolitically, there's dollars that are in today's oil price that God willing will be resolved without arms conflict. We know that there's Iranian barrels that are probably coming on, I said, by the end of the year, but it may be at the end of this month. And we've got this further in the Permian Basin that's continuing to lift U.S. production forecast. And while OPEC hasn't performed up to their 400,000 barrels per day per month production increases, but I think they're getting closer to it. And I don't know what their surplus is, but it's not zero yet. So all of those things, to me, you add them together actually seem to be a little bit more bearish for crude than it does to be optimistic. And the other thing is if we're wrong and oil price is higher, we're going to generate a lot of free cash flow, and our investors are going to get a lot of that return to them. And if I'm right, then we've protected our investments, and we've made the right decisions. So $60, I don't know that it's a hard and fast number, but it's kind of the aperture at which we start all of our decisions on investments, whether it's M&A or drilling wells or share buybacks. And I think one add is to that is that right now, we're drilling single wells. And there's a huge cost inefficiency when you're drilling single wells trying to delineate a play. Once you move into full cycle development and you can drill at least four wells, simul-frac operations, and combine that with the efficient drilling operations, you can drive a lot of cost out of the equation, which raises the economics on a play like Limelight and actually makes us start to compete for our capital with the other items in our portfolio. Thank you, Charles. Thank you again to everyone listening today. If you've got any questions, just reach out to us using the contact information provided."

Particularly like 490, and we exited pre-pandemic around 400 rigs. Thanks, Nitin. Yes. We drilled a couple of wells there. I think we have a couple of planned this year. It's still early in the testing phase, but at $90 oil, it certainly competes even at $60 oil, including the low entry cost, it competes on a full cycle basis, but not yet does it compete with our core Midland and Delaware Basin position."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today. Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy Third Quarter 2021 Conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice CEO, Kaes Van't Hof CFO and Daniel Wesson EVP of Operations. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company's financial conditions, results of operations plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback 's Third Quarter Earnings Call. The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for Diamondback. We were able to generate a record amount of free cash flow as we continue to demonstrate why we are an operational leader in the Permian Basin. Although we're seeing pricing pressure in many areas of our business, particularly with consumables and labor, we've been able to offset these inflationary items through efficiency gains, both in design and execution. On the drilling side, we've decreased the number of days it takes to drill from spud to total depth by nearly 30% this year alone. And we're now drilling 2 mile laterals in roughly 10 days in the Midland Basin. On the completion side of the business. we've seen a step change in efficiency as we've transitioned the majority of our completion crews to simul -frac operations and are now completing wells in the Midland Basin, nearly 70% faster than when we were utilizing the traditional zipper frac design. These gains drove a significant beat on capital expenditures this quarter. And all the primary driver of our second consecutive decrease in capex for the year. The efficiencies gains this year will be permanent. And while inflation may impact services prices next year, Diamondback will be more insulated than our peers, given our control over the variable cost of well-designed, days to total depth on the drilling side, and lateral feet completed per day on the completion side of the business. As a result of these efficiency gains, as well as timing associated with some of our ancillary capital spend. We have lowered our 2021 capital guidance for a second time, and now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year, a decrease of 10% when compared to our initial capex guidance range we published in April. This includes approximately $435 to $475 million of estimated capital spend in the fourth quarter. Moving to 2022, we are committed to holding our Permian oil production flat next year. We expect to be able to maintain this level of production by spending similar capital on an annualized basis to our fourth quarter guidance. This soft guidance accounts for both the efficiencies we've gained this year, as well as the potential for service cost inflation in 2022, should activity levels increase in the Permian Basin and oil prices staged on. The reason we're committed to keeping oil volumes flat in 2022 is that we believe our capital discipline, coupled with our plan to return 50% of anticipated free cash flow to shareholders is the best near-term path to equity value creation. Diamondback is moving from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital, which will benefit long-term return on capital employed and to value creation. In order to initiate a moderate growth plan, we would need to see material changes to global oil and gas fundamentals, along with the shareholder support for such growth, and we do not see either of those things today. Until such time, we will continue to run our business for free cash flow generation, focusing internally, and ensuring we maintain our best-in-class cost structure in the face of inflationary pressure. This will position us for success regardless of where we are in the cycle. At current commodity prices, this plan translates to significant free cash flow generation next year. In our investor deck, we have a slide that shows illustrative 2022 free cash flow at various commodity prices. At today's strip, 2022 free cash flow is well worth of $3 billion. We plan to distribute 50% of this free cash flow using the combination of our sustainable and growing base dividend, share repurchases, and variable dividends. We would use repurchases and variable dividends interchangeably, depending on which presents the best return to our stockholders at that time. As a reminder, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when we expect the return on that repurchase to be well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices. Which was clearly the case at mid-September when our board approved a $2 billion share repurchase program. After that announcement, we repurchased over 268,000 shares at an average share price of $82 for a total cost of $22 million in the third quarter. If we do not repurchase enough shares in the quarter to equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors hold by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend.This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend, but importantly, at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned. We do not set our budget, drill wells, or underwrite acquisitions based on a strip oil pricing when current strip pricing is significantly above the last 5-year average. Therefore, we will underwrite repurchasing shares, which we see as an acquisition under the same assumptions. Our based dividend continues to be our primary method of returning capital to our shareholders. We have grown our base dividend at a quarterly compounded growth rate of roughly 10% since initiation in 2019. This quarter we raised our dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share for $2 a share on an annualized basis. Due to our low cost of supply, our dividend is currently protected down to $35 a barrel. As we have said before, increases to our base dividend would occur simultaneously with absolute debt reduction, and this year was a great example of that. Year-to-date, we have used our $1.65 billion of internally generated free cash flow, as well as proceeds from divestitures, to reduce our gross debt by $1.3 billion and increase our dividend 3 times. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. And we expect to end 2021 at just over a turn of leverage. Yesterday, we fully redeemed our 650 million of senior notes due in 2023. As a result, we no longer have any callable debt. And our next material maturity is late 2024. Because of this, we are now in a position to accelerate our returns program to the fourth quarter of 2021. This is a direct result of the combination of everything I've mentioned today: 1. Strong operational performance, 2. A supportive macro backdrop, and 3. Increasing financial strength. Yet none of this would be possible without safe and efficient field operations. We continue to build on our safety track record and did not have a recordable employee safety incident this quarter. We have also decreased our flared volumes on our legacy properties and continued to work with third-parties to build out additional infrastructure to reduce flared volumes on our recently acquired assets. In addition, we expect to continue our reduced -- continue to reduce our flared volumes as we move into 2022 in conjunction with the completion of our Bakken divestiture. Yet, we're striving to be better and we recently announced our commitment and routine flaring by 2025, further reducing our emissions and moving us towards our commitment of reducing Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50%, and our methane intensity by at least 70% by 2024. The third quarter was a record quarter for Diamondback. We're proud to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in industry. And are thankful to operate in a pro-energy environment in the state of Texas. Our products, fuel, our local communities, our state, our country, and the world, we continue to innovate. Justifying our environmental license to operate in the communities where we and our families live, work, and play. We will continue to operate reliably and safely and are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current macro environment by exercising capital discipline, keeping oil volumes flat, and generating significant returns to our shareholders. With these comments complete, Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q& A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram : Preliminary -- I can't hear you. Can you hear me now?\nTravis Stice : Yeah, got you now, Arun.\nArun Jayaram : Sorry about that. Travis Stice, I wanted to get your preliminary thoughts on the 2022 outlook. In the deck, you highlighted an operating cash flow outlook of $4.8 billion at 70 and that $5.3+ billion at 80. You mentioned $3 billion to $3.5 billion of free cash flow under that range of oil price. This year, you're doing 270 gross sales. So my question is, what type of activity do you expect in 2022 that depends at $1.8 million budget? And I would be interested to know what kind of cash tax rate you're assuming in that free cash flow guide?\nTravis Stice : Yes. Thanks, Arun. Good questions. From an activity perspective, not a lot's going to change. Still going to be 75% or 80% of our wells turned in line in the Midland Basin still at this kind of 65 to 75 a quarter run rig. The only difference in '22 versus 2021 is that, remember we have -- we run a lot of rigs into the downturn in 2020 and decided to keep those rigs running to build docks. We drew down about 50 of those docks in 2021, and now are at a steady-state DUC levels. So we got a 50 DUC headwind in 2022 versus 2021, and then a little more infrastructure and midstream spend on the sale. in order to Robert reinitiate that we acquired from GEP and guide on as we get in before field development, there. cash taxes. If the world stays where it is today, oil-price wise, we will have some cash taxes in 2022, in the low 9-figures, hundred-ish to 200 million depending where we are, which is a good problem to have. Hopefully, the commodity prices stay where they are.\nArun Jayaram : Great. Thanks for that. And just my follow-up. I wanted to see that case maybe for you if you could provide a little bit more detail around the drilling efficiency gains that you're seeing. I think you highlighted on Slide 11, 10 days now for 2 model lateral in the Midland Basin, then it also maybe describe where you're doing on the completion side and perhaps just the mix of [Indiscernible] frac in '22.\nTravis Stice: Yes, I'll start with tunnel frac. We picked up our first tunnel frac crews in the second half of 2020 and have been running those ever since. They've been extremely efficient, probably saves us about $25 or $30 a foot. But more importantly, in areas where you have offset production. You can get in, complete those wells, and get out and, therefore, limit your water out effect in large fields, which has been successful for us. So essentially, probably 90% of our wells next year, we'll be done with the tunnel frac crew. We've been running 3 tunnel frac crews this year, plus a fourth spot crew here and there. And I anticipate that can pace to be similar in 2022. And then on the drilling side has been pretty incredible putting the QEP drilling organization together with the Diamondback drilling organization and finding best practices. And this is the first -- and we kind of talked about this last quarter and the quarter before that, but now we've fully converted all of our Midland Basin rigs to the clear fluids drilling system that we're utilizing. And you can see average of ten days spud to TD has been a pretty large step change. And as Travis said in his comments, we all use the same fixed costs in our wells, but\nKaes Van't Hof: days to TD and amount of lateral fee completed per day are variable costs that we think we certainly differentiate ourselves with. So that's been the driver of CapEx reductions this year. And in an inflationary environment which we're seeing, given the oil prices and activity levels, that inflation is mitigated by controlling the variable costs which are our operations organization has been able to do.\nTravis Stice : And Arun, just to add to that point, when you look ahead in the future, it's always hard to see a step change in performance like we have seen this year, particularly on the drilling side. But just like I've said before, that Diamondback has been an operational leader and I expect us to maintain that position even going into the next several years.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTravis Stice : Thank you, Arun.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta : Good morning, team. Travis you made the comment on the last call that you thought this was more of a seller's market than a buyer's market. Can you provide an update on your latest thoughts around M&A, and if you still feel that's the appropriate strategy and then prioritize and buying back your stock. Or returning capital makes sense relative to M&A.\nTravis Stice : The best way I can think about M&A right now is in share repurchases. I think to make some comments there about try and we don't underwrite M&A or share repurchases at these high commodity prices. And look, right now it's not something that I've been spending any of my time on M&A. I spend most of my time on seemed like regulatory policy related efforts and not the M&A. But, yeah, as you said the comment in the past, it's probably still true today that it's still feels based on these smaller deals rocking seller's market. But that's typically what you see with commodity prices like they've done this year.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks, Travis. And then just to continue to flush out the cost point. There's a lot of talk about service cost inflation as we move into ' 22. And potentially some tightness in the pressure pumping market. Can you talk about how you're managing some of those inflation risks and confidence interval around being able to execute on the capital budget that you start to pencil out here.\nTravis Stice : Yeah. I mean, what's -- the benefit we have. We've talked about the efficiency gains, but this year it's kind of been the year of raw materials going up on well costs, steel, diesel, sand, but it's logical that the service piece given labor tightness start to get a little traction. Now, it's really going to be dependent on where the rig count goes. We only added 8 rigs in the Permian in October. If we add a 100 rigs and it's going to be a lot tighter next year from here. But if we kind of find a steady-state then it's getting tougher for the service guys to push price. But either way, with the tunnel frac crews running with 3 crews running, we have no intention of dropping any of those, that kind of consistency for our business partners allows them to boost their margin profile and now that they have consistent work with Diamondback.\nNeil Mehta : Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggett from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nDoug Leggett : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Guys, I wonder if I could ask, I guess it's kind of a housekeeping question on cost guidance. It looks to us that based on the guidance you've given for the fourth quarter, the Bakken or the [Indiscernible] looks like it had, on a number of levels, higher cash cost [Indiscernible], and so on. Would that be the right interpretation? In which case, could you give us some idea of how you expect maybe just qualitatively that run rate to look in 2022? Are we looking at a step down because the [Indiscernible] is now no longer part of the portfolio?\nTravis Stice : Good question, Doug, I mean, primarily LOE probably comes down a couple of times from where it's been the last couple of quarters with the Bakken contributing. So I think generally moving towards the low 4s and $4 a BOE and on the LOE side. We did keep the Bakken for a little longer than we liked but that kind of impacted the transition employees on the G&A side. So G&A probably comes down a nickel or so and then gathering transportation, certainly higher costs in the Bakken. So you probably see a step change down or step-down and GP&T closer to that kind of 125 to 150 range on a go-forward basis. So given an asset that we when we bought it, when we bought QEP, we've put up for sale right away. Unfortunately, the regulatory environment took a little longer to get it close, but generally, I think we're happy with the deal, is happy with the deal and our cost structure comes down a little bit in Q4 and into 2022.\nDoug Leggett : Okay. So I guess what I'm really getting at here is at least, it looks like a bit of an inflation offset on the operating cost side rather than on the capital side. I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting that correctly. So it sounds like I'm on the right track there.\nTravis Stice : Yes.\nDoug Leggett : Okay. Guys, I hate to be tough on the cash distribution policy as my second question, but I just want to get a little bit of clarification here. So let's assume that the current strip you're running at probably a $4 billion free cash number next year. So half of that goes back to shareholders and half of that goes to the balance sheet. That's pretty much what you are saying currently, right?\nTravis Stice : Yeah. At least half of that goes back to shareholders.\nDoug Leggett : Okay. So when you -- when we think about the rate -- the run rate, if you like for buybacks, the number could be pretty punchy and I just wanted to get a handle as to how you guys are thinking about that, because one on numbers you could be buying back a substantial amount of your stock. And I'm trying to think, do we run not $2 billion buyback over what period? That's really what I'm trying to get out because it sounds like it will get reloaded at some point.\nTravis Stice : Yes, I mean, I think the key value that's up the buyback is going to be opportunistic, not problematic. And as Charles said in his prepared remarks, you think about the buyback in terms of what is NAV at mid-cycle oil prices. Now we can have a long debate about where mid-cycle oil prices are going. But one quarter end, we're not willing to underwrite mid-cycle oil prices higher than we've seen in the last 5 years. I think the key is that the buybacks out there as a weapon for us at our disposal. But overall 50% of cash flows, free cash flow is getting returns. And if we don't get through the buyback in the quarter, there are lots of ups and downs in this industry. We don't get through the buyback in one particular quarter we're going to make our shareholders hold with a variable dividend, the quarter following.\nDoug Leggett : Well, this is a [Indiscernible] noise. $70-oil, it seems to actually got a long way to go before the stock is fairly valued. So I just wanted to understand how aggressive we should be on the buyback assumption, but I appreciate --\nTravis Stice : Yeah. And that's a good problem to have. And considering where were this summer when we had low 70's oil and the stock was 30%, 40% below where it is. I think we're in a great position right now and I think there are opportunities on the buyback side. And we look forward to not being blacked out in a day or two and getting back after.\nDoug Leggett: I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Yes, Doug, just to add to that, it's all good. It's hard to think back just 12 months ago when oil price was half of what it is today. And so we know that we're in a volatile industry and we think being cautious and also providing our shareholders the maximum flexibility is still the prudent way to run the business and I hope that the answers to the capital allocation question you just asked demonstrate that they were trying to be prudent in generating maximum shareholder returns.\nDoug Leggett : All right. Thanks Travis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning all. Congrats on your quarter end update.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield : Perhaps for you, Travis or Kaes, early 2022 indications from industry like yourself seemed to suggest the sectors broadly remaining capital discipline. In light of this discipline and the recovery in demand, the environment to us continues to look very constructive for the commodity, and the sectors valuations certainly remain attractive relative to the market. What are the 1 to 2 potential developments for the sector that gives you concern and could change the outlook to a less favorable one?\nTravis Stice : Well there is one thing that I think we have to watch very carefully and that's the discipline that the public Companies demonstrate in their earnings call now and again in February. Because it's really -- if a Company comes out there and starts growing, even though I've been very demonstrative that the world doesn't need that growth right now. But if a Company comes out of starts growing and gets recognized in the stock market for that growth, then that's going to change the calculus for our board and how we allocate capital towards growth. Again, I think if you look at the macro conditions, post-pandemic, we need 100 million barrels a day of demand reestablished. We're probably getting close there. More importantly, we need to see the surplus capacity, whatever that number is and the OpEx plus countries being absorbed in the world's energy equation. And then third lead, you need to see kind of the 5-year average of global inventories return. And it's unlikely you will see all 3 of those triangulate precisely, but I think you need to look at the price of oil when those indicators are all pointing at each other. And if the price of world is $70 or $80 a barrel, when those things are pointed each other, that probably means we're in good shape in terms of supply and demand. If on the other hand, oil price is significantly higher than those indicators pointing at each other. Then that's probably our first sign that the world is calling for more -- for more oil. But even having said that, our board is dedicated to making sure that we're allocating capital that's going to generate the greatest return to our stockholders. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've rapidly transitioned from a Company that consumes capital for growth to now one that is distributing capital. And we're looking at holding production flat and we're looking at growing per-share measures while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. And we think that's a prudent way to run our business.\nDerrick Whitfield : Great. And as my follow-up, perhaps digging into your operational efficiencies and really following up on Ellen's ( ph ) earlier question on Sanyal frac ops. Do you have a sense -- I'm sure you, but what percent of your wells today are seeing 2-well versus 4-wells Sanyal frac? And are the practical limitations that will limit 4-well implementation program line?\nTravis Stice : No. Almost a 100% of our Midland Basin pads or 4 wells or more. And the benefit of simul - frac, you've got to have an even number of wells, given that you're running 2, basically 2 careers at the same time. So less apparent in the Delaware. After Delaware, we're probably 50% 2 well or 4 well plus, and 80% 2 well plus, and the Midland, it's almost a 100% 4 well plus.\nDerrick Whitfield : Great update and thanks again for your time.\nTravis Stice : Thank you, Derrick.\nAdam Lawlis: Thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Morning, Travis and Kaes. Thanks for your time this morning.\nTravis Stice : Good morning, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Just wanted to be a little bit more explicit around the well cost inflation. I just wanted to confirm, you all reached record points in the third quarter at $500 a foot in the Midland and 700 in the Delaware. Are you all modeling that now as sort of the trough period for costs? Is that already baked in at the higher level in the fourth quarter guide?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I mean, we had a really good quarter in the third quarter efficiency-wise. No major issues on drilling, completion went off without a hitch, not a lot of weather. So we certainly don't model for the best case scenario. But this is probably the base that we're going to build off of in terms of inflation going into '22. We went into 2021, got into 7% to 10% well cost inflation. Been able to go the other way. But like Travis said earlier in the call, we don't model in efficiency enhancements throughout the year in our budget. But certainly the organization on the upside is motivated to continue to push the limits. But this feels like a pretty solid quarter in terms of costs that will be tough to replicate in this kind of inflationary environment.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate that and just for my follow-up,. Travis, perhaps for you or, in case, Kaes as well, but you referenced looking at per share metrics with the buyback. Before you talked about -- looking at using a buyback on your expected return exceed your cost of capital. Are you also looking at what your effective production growth per share looks like when you're considering buying back shares versus perhaps growing in the event that you see some of those early indicators coming back with the world calling for more oil?\nTravis Stice : Yeah, that's good. That's a good point, part of that part of the buyback work that we did when we announced it was, we looked at how much capital does it take to grow the business 5% a year for the next 5 years or grow the business 10% a year for the next 5 years versus shrink the business by 5 or 10% a year in terms of share count over the next 5 years. And the law of large numbers kept us up to on the growth side, but on the buyback side of the shrink side, it started to get easier to grow per-share metrics year 2 and 3. And obviously it's stock price dependent, but that was along the work that we did. We do our shareholders own more reserves per share, production per share, a longer inventory life per share. With the buyback versus trying to just follow into the ground and oversupply market that's already pretty fragile.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nTravis Stice : Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nScott Hanold: Thanks. Good morning. If I can return back to these shareholder return plan. And I think you all said, you're going to at least give 50% back to investors, and could you just give some color around that? Does that mean, if they're not debt take-out opportunities, you'd potentially look at say, increasing the buyback or dividend above, sort of that 50% threshold. And also on, if you can give some color on the fixed dividend. Where could that go? You all get to a point where it just doesn't feel comfortable because of the sustainability at more of a mid-cycle price.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Scott, conversations with large shareholders have basically said, we want to make sure there's dividends well-protected below 40. Our dividend breakeven for '22 is in the $35-oil range. And we're buying puts at $50-oil. So I think we're still very well protected. I think the dividend is going to continue to grow. The Board talked about it every quarter. We've hit this 10% CAGR since introduction in 2018. That's probably a lofty goal to continue for multiple years, but certainly something we're talking about continuing the dividend growth on a steady basis aggressively. And I think as long as that breakeven stays in the mid to high 30s, we feel pretty good about it.\nScott Hanold: Okay. And could you comment on the view on taken out debt? And if you would, focus a little bit more on variable dividends or buybacks, if there's not that take down.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yeah, that's right. Sorry about that. We still want to take down gross debt. We have a maturity in 2024. We also want to keep a larger cash balance and we've run in the past just for inflation. But yeah, we're kind of saying, hey, listen at least 50% of the free cash flow has got to go back to the shareholders. And if we don't have anything else to do with it, and I think it's logical that more will go back, so I would like to have cash to take up the 24s and be in a position to not have any material maturities until 2029. But like we've gone over the last 5 or 6 quarters, that's not mutually exclusive from our shareholders getting more money back.\nScott Hanold: Okay. And then as you look into 2022, how do you think? And I know you all are talking about flat oil production into next year. If you were to just outperform operationally, would you guys I guess, reduce your well completions, say in the back half for the year to maintain flat production, or should we assume that you'll have that 65-70 well program next year? And if there's operational performance, maybe you do a little bit better than maintain a flat production.\nTravis Stice : Well, I think generally right, got outperformed guidance on oil production, which we've done this year. But what we've said all year is that, if we are doing better than we thought, we're going to cut capital. And that's what we've done in 2021. And I think that's essentially the goal for 2022, even in the face of some inflationary pressures.\nScott Hanold: Got it. Appreciate it.\nTravis Stice : Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. Sorry, but I want to go back into the cash return. I think it make a lot sense with the volatility in the market that you put 50% of the excess cash go into the balance sheet. But is there a number at some point on your net debt will be at a point that you may be able to raise the cash returns from 50% to 75% or higher? Is that some number that you might, that you guys are thinking, or that's not really is just that you will go with and saying that, okay, if I don't have any additional use because that I no longer have any debt to you right away then I would just increasing that percentage?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yeah, Paul. That's a great question. I think what we're focused on is committing to the -- at least 50% right now, as this industry evolves and you see companies make these types of commitments. You don't want to walk them back, right? So there will be quarters where we distribute more cash than 50%, but also, I don't want that to become a baseline for the next couple of decades. I think we're focused on 50% right now and some quarters will do better and some quarters will hit it that at 50%, but the 50s are for guarantee.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. And the second question just relates to your midstream operation letter with the dividend yield over 8%, much higher than the spend the fang is sell. One will argue that your cost of capital is actually very high over there. And doesn't seems to me that really have good reason to have that as an independent trade. We have seen a lot of consolidation in the midstream business. One of your peers that their midstream asset just recently announced to merge with a private Company. And that's where you're going to reduce their ownership so that they can deconsolidate. So just curious then, how you're looking at that business and whether that you may want to do some alternative initiative we need to the structure on that.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yeah. Good question. And we've seen a couple routes. We've seen some parent Companies buy in their subsidiaries and some sell down. You know, I think for us, it's more strategic just to keep it -- to keep that cost structure. And we can address it more on the [Indiscernible] call. But I think if you look under the hood, we've been really trying to highlight the Rattler story. We signed a new [Indiscernible] earlier this year or this month, that's going to be highly successful for us, with a lot of Diamondback exposure. We've got the Rattler assets dropped down about in another month. So certainly the strategy as a subsidiary hasn't changed and the importance of it to us hasn't changed. I certainly don't think we'd go down the cell route. But we look at costs capital, we look at multiples, and we've got -- if the stock is not working, we've got to think about what to do. But right now, it seems like it's -- Rattlers had a good year. It doesn't have the commodity exposure that Diamondback and Viper, perhaps it's probably under performed a little bit, but it's still generating a lot of free cash to Unit holders of which Diamondback's the largest.\nPaul Cheng: Yeah, the only thing I would say is that, Diamondback have a good story and is probably one of the most attractive NPS names out there. And I think we will help that to even further simplified the CapEx structure so that when the investor looking at you, they you don't have to look at so many different CapEx structures. Just my utmost feeling. Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Yeah we heard that before Paul and we've recognized it. Fortunately, the mother ship has gotten very large and so there's less leakage to the subsidiaries, but both have been important to us over the last -- for the last half decade.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani : Hey, guys. Just wanted to touch base a bit on third quarter production. It looks like it kind of outperformed here and just wanted to get a little bit of color behind that in terms of being a little bit ahead of the guidance was just pretty much just better well performance. You did mention kind of a pretty claim operational quarter with no weather issues.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: We had a good quarter. We're very focused on hitting our numbers and the benefit of slowing down and not trying to grow as fast as possible is that the operations organization has gotten better. You can see it on the well cost side. It's also happening on the production side. So good quarter all around. I think we feel really confident in the forward outlook and continuing to hit our numbers here.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. Then, just in terms of '22 capex, I understand it's a loose guide that you folks targeted here. If I take the fourth-quarter capex range and annualize it, gives me 1.74 billion to 1.9. So pretty wide there at the end of the day. Just wanted to get a sense, what you guys think perhaps the outcome could be on the inflation side there. And I know it's still moving target here and we weren't on 100% know how this plays out. But any early indications of what the inflation can be and is that what would target the top end of the 1.9? Just trying to get a sense of what it was baked in there.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: I think I've said this, 2022 is not going to be long on November second of 2021. We are one of the few companies talking about 2022, we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks, but probably have about 10% inflation built into there with a little bit more infrastructure and midstream spend, that we didn't need to go through this year. But generally, I think we can narrow that guidance as we get into 2022 and have more evidence. I think the comment earlier, if the rig count goes up a 100 rigs from here, it's a different story. Than if the rig count keeps creeping up 5 to 10 rigs a month.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. Thanks, guys.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Thanks, Leo.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade : Good morning, Travis and Kaes.\nTravis Stice : Hey, Charles.\nCharles Meade : Travis, I want to thank you for your prepared comments, you really addressed a lot of the natural questions, on why you've adopted the stance you have for ' 22. But just one question for me, is around the buyback. When we look at the -- you guys announced it on the 15th, and if we look at the average price you bought back in the and the chart of your share price, it looks like you guys got after it for a few days and then wrapped it up probably in about a week. And I'm curious, is the right inference to make is that low 80s is where you guys -- where the scale tips to buybacks as far as the preferred way to return, I guess increase returns to shareholders or alternatively is it that -- Kaes, you mentioned a blackout earlier and obviously that makes sense. That -- is that a function of your legal team putting you a blackout a few days before the end of the quarter?\nTravis Stice : Yeah. I think is just purely we get blacked out. We get blacked out 10 days before the quarter ends and were blacked out until a couple of days after earnings. So we'll assess where we are in a couple of days and be back after it.\nCharles Meade : That's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nTravis Stice : Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer from Barkley. Your line is now open.\nHarry Mateer: Hi. Good morning, guys. I want to dig in maybe a little bit more on the debt piece of it you guys talked around it. But as you noted, nothing callable at this point given what you've taken out so far this year, next maturity in 2024. First question is, how do you navigate that? Because -- are you thinking about tenders, make holes that gets expensive, but then at the same time sitting with a bunch of cash in the balance sheet, waiting for the maturity at the end of '24 might not be viewed as attractive either. So, how are you thinking about approaching that in the next couple of years?\nTravis Stice : I think we're just going to keep following the prices of the bonds and try to get below may call as we can. If not, the may call is not too restrictive on something like our '24s as you get in the late ' 22, but certainly not looking to take out anything past 2029.\nHarry Mateer: Got it. Okay. And then on the cash balance, what -- you mentioned one to run with more of a buffer than you had in the past. What is that number for you?\nTravis Stice: I like 500 as a minimum, we kind of said that over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's a good starting point for us.\nHarry Mateer: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Thanks Harry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Sankey Research. Your line is now open.\nPaul Sankey: Guys, this reporting the Wall Street Journal this morning that the FDA is going to massively increase methane emission limits. Can you just talk a little bit about what that means for you and for the industry? And then I had a question from a major investor who asked me to -- I heard from Diamondback that multiyear flat volumes are now embraced by you and not just for 2022, is that what I'm hearing? Thanks.\nTravis Stice : Yes. The methane rules. I think we still have to see how the final document is written down if that continues as I've stated in my prepared remarks to focus on methane intensity. We're going to reduce that by 70% from 2019 levels by 2024. So depends on where the threshold is, but I've been very pleased with the progress we've made already on reducing methane intensity. And in fact, we've got 20+ million dollars allocated next year to continue those efforts to reduce methane intensity. And if we do things right, hopefully we will be below the threshold, by which the methane intensity applies.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: And then for our multi-year plans, we've always issued multi-year plans at Diamondback. We didn't buy into a multiyear growth plan in 2016 and we're not going to commit to multiple years at flat today. Now, certainly 2022 and 2021 will both be relatively flat production. We think it's worked and capital discipline has worked for this industry. I think this industry has tried a market share war with OpEx before and it didn't work out. So why don't we let OpEx bring back their spare capacity and all stay flat, and we will see what the future holds in 2023 and beyond. But right now we're committed to 2022 flat capital discipline as rollover Diamondback. And as Travis mentioned, we're going to become a net return of capital rather than consumer of capital.\nTravis Stice : And look OpEx is going to do what OpEx is going to do. I've said we've transitioned in it that Virbac transition very rapidly from consuming capital, returning capital. And focused on the increase or the growth that we're seeing in per-share metrics. And I've outlined as the macro elements by which the world will be calling on more growth. And I think every quarter that we go through, Diamondback, it's board is demonstrating our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. And we're doing that right now about generating all this free cash flow this way. But free cash flow is coming to us and our commitment to return at least 50% of that back to the shareholders.\nPaul Sankey: Understood, guys. Thanks.\nTravis Stice : Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to CEO, Travis Stice. You may proceed.\nTravis Stice : Thank you again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you got any questions, please contact us using the information provided.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. [Operator Instructions]",

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback 's Third Quarter Earnings Call. The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for Diamondback. We were able to generate a record amount of free cash flow as we continue to demonstrate why we are an operational leader in the Permian Basin. Although we're seeing pricing pressure in many areas of our business, particularly with consumables and labor, we've been able to offset these inflationary items through efficiency gains, both in design and execution. On the drilling side, we've decreased the number of days it takes to drill from spud to total depth by nearly 30% this year alone. And we're now drilling 2 mile laterals in roughly 10 days in the Midland Basin. On the completion side of the business. we've seen a step change in efficiency as we've transitioned the majority of our completion crews to simul -frac operations and are now completing wells in the Midland Basin, nearly 70% faster than when we were utilizing the traditional zipper frac design. These gains drove a significant beat on capital expenditures this quarter. And all the primary driver of our second consecutive decrease in capex for the year. The efficiencies gains this year will be permanent. And while inflation may impact services prices next year, Diamondback will be more insulated than our peers, given our control over the variable cost of well-designed, days to total depth on the drilling side, and lateral feet completed per day on the completion side of the business. As a result of these efficiency gains, as well as timing associated with some of our ancillary capital spend. We have lowered our 2021 capital guidance for a second time, and now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year, a decrease of 10% when compared to our initial capex guidance range we published in April. This includes approximately $435 to $475 million of estimated capital spend in the fourth quarter. Moving to 2022, we are committed to holding our Permian oil production flat next year. We expect to be able to maintain this level of production by spending similar capital on an annualized basis to our fourth quarter guidance. This soft guidance accounts for both the efficiencies we've gained this year, as well as the potential for service cost inflation in 2022, should activity levels increase in the Permian Basin and oil prices staged on. The reason we're committed to keeping oil volumes flat in 2022 is that we believe our capital discipline, coupled with our plan to return 50% of anticipated free cash flow to shareholders is the best near-term path to equity value creation. Diamondback is moving from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital, which will benefit long-term return on capital employed and to value creation. In order to initiate a moderate growth plan, we would need to see material changes to global oil and gas fundamentals, along with the shareholder support for such growth, and we do not see either of those things today. Until such time, we will continue to run our business for free cash flow generation, focusing internally, and ensuring we maintain our best-in-class cost structure in the face of inflationary pressure. This will position us for success regardless of where we are in the cycle. At current commodity prices, this plan translates to significant free cash flow generation next year. In our investor deck, we have a slide that shows illustrative 2022 free cash flow at various commodity prices. At today's strip, 2022 free cash flow is well worth of $3 billion. We plan to distribute 50% of this free cash flow using the combination of our sustainable and growing base dividend, share repurchases, and variable dividends. We would use repurchases and variable dividends interchangeably, depending on which presents the best return to our stockholders at that time. As a reminder, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when we expect the return on that repurchase to be well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices. Which was clearly the case at mid-September when our board approved a $2 billion share repurchase program. After that announcement, we repurchased over 268,000 shares at an average share price of $82 for a total cost of $22 million in the third quarter. If we do not repurchase enough shares in the quarter to equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors hold by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend.This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend, but importantly, at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned. We do not set our budget, drill wells, or underwrite acquisitions based on a strip oil pricing when current strip pricing is significantly above the last 5-year average. Therefore, we will underwrite repurchasing shares, which we see as an acquisition under the same assumptions. Our based dividend continues to be our primary method of returning capital to our shareholders. We have grown our base dividend at a quarterly compounded growth rate of roughly 10% since initiation in 2019. This quarter we raised our dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share for $2 a share on an annualized basis. Due to our low cost of supply, our dividend is currently protected down to $35 a barrel. As we have said before, increases to our base dividend would occur simultaneously with absolute debt reduction, and this year was a great example of that. Year-to-date, we have used our $1.65 billion of internally generated free cash flow, as well as proceeds from divestitures, to reduce our gross debt by $1.3 billion and increase our dividend 3 times. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. And we expect to end 2021 at just over a turn of leverage. Yesterday, we fully redeemed our 650 million of senior notes due in 2023. As a result, we no longer have any callable debt. And our next material maturity is late 2024. Because of this, we are now in a position to accelerate our returns program to the fourth quarter of 2021. This is a direct result of the combination of everything I've mentioned today: 1. Strong operational performance, 2. A supportive macro backdrop, and 3. Increasing financial strength. Yet none of this would be possible without safe and efficient field operations. We continue to build on our safety track record and did not have a recordable employee safety incident this quarter. We have also decreased our flared volumes on our legacy properties and continued to work with third-parties to build out additional infrastructure to reduce flared volumes on our recently acquired assets. In addition, we expect to continue our reduced -- continue to reduce our flared volumes as we move into 2022 in conjunction with the completion of our Bakken divestiture. Yet, we're striving to be better and we recently announced our commitment and routine flaring by 2025, further reducing our emissions and moving us towards our commitment of reducing Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50%, and our methane intensity by at least 70% by 2024. The third quarter was a record quarter for Diamondback. We're proud to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in industry. And are thankful to operate in a pro-energy environment in the state of Texas. Our products, fuel, our local communities, our state, our country, and the world, we continue to innovate. Justifying our environmental license to operate in the communities where we and our families live, work, and play. We will continue to operate reliably and safely and are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current macro environment by exercising capital discipline, keeping oil volumes flat, and generating significant returns to our shareholders. With these comments complete, Operator, please open the line for questions. Yeah, got you now, Arun. Yes. Thanks, Arun. Good questions. From an activity perspective, not a lot's going to change. Still going to be 75% or 80% of our wells turned in line in the Midland Basin still at this kind of 65 to 75 a quarter run rig. The only difference in '22 versus 2021 is that, remember we have -- we run a lot of rigs into the downturn in 2020 and decided to keep those rigs running to build docks. We drew down about 50 of those docks in 2021, and now are at a steady-state DUC levels. So we got a 50 DUC headwind in 2022 versus 2021, and then a little more infrastructure and midstream spend on the sale. in order to Robert reinitiate that we acquired from GEP and guide on as we get in before field development, there. cash taxes. If the world stays where it is today, oil-price wise, we will have some cash taxes in 2022, in the low 9-figures, hundred-ish to 200 million depending where we are, which is a good problem to have. Hopefully, the commodity prices stay where they are. Yes, I'll start with tunnel frac. We picked up our first tunnel frac crews in the second half of 2020 and have been running those ever since. They've been extremely efficient, probably saves us about $25 or $30 a foot. But more importantly, in areas where you have offset production. You can get in, complete those wells, and get out and, therefore, limit your water out effect in large fields, which has been successful for us. So essentially, probably 90% of our wells next year, we'll be done with the tunnel frac crew. We've been running 3 tunnel frac crews this year, plus a fourth spot crew here and there. And I anticipate that can pace to be similar in 2022. And then on the drilling side has been pretty incredible putting the QEP drilling organization together with the Diamondback drilling organization and finding best practices. And this is the first -- and we kind of talked about this last quarter and the quarter before that, but now we've fully converted all of our Midland Basin rigs to the clear fluids drilling system that we're utilizing. And you can see average of ten days spud to TD has been a pretty large step change. And as Travis said in his comments, we all use the same fixed costs in our wells, but And Arun, just to add to that point, when you look ahead in the future, it's always hard to see a step change in performance like we have seen this year, particularly on the drilling side. But just like I've said before, that Diamondback has been an operational leader and I expect us to maintain that position even going into the next several years. Thank you, Arun. The best way I can think about M&A right now is in share repurchases. I think to make some comments there about try and we don't underwrite M&A or share repurchases at these high commodity prices. And look, right now it's not something that I've been spending any of my time on M&A. I spend most of my time on seemed like regulatory policy related efforts and not the M&A. But, yeah, as you said the comment in the past, it's probably still true today that it's still feels based on these smaller deals rocking seller's market. But that's typically what you see with commodity prices like they've done this year. Yeah. I mean, what's -- the benefit we have. We've talked about the efficiency gains, but this year it's kind of been the year of raw materials going up on well costs, steel, diesel, sand, but it's logical that the service piece given labor tightness start to get a little traction. Now, it's really going to be dependent on where the rig count goes. We only added 8 rigs in the Permian in October. If we add a 100 rigs and it's going to be a lot tighter next year from here. But if we kind of find a steady-state then it's getting tougher for the service guys to push price. But either way, with the tunnel frac crews running with 3 crews running, we have no intention of dropping any of those, that kind of consistency for our business partners allows them to boost their margin profile and now that they have consistent work with Diamondback. Thank you, Neil. Good question, Doug, I mean, primarily LOE probably comes down a couple of times from where it's been the last couple of quarters with the Bakken contributing. So I think generally moving towards the low 4s and $4 a BOE and on the LOE side. We did keep the Bakken for a little longer than we liked but that kind of impacted the transition employees on the G&A side. So G&A probably comes down a nickel or so and then gathering transportation, certainly higher costs in the Bakken. So you probably see a step change down or step-down and GP&T closer to that kind of 125 to 150 range on a go-forward basis. So given an asset that we when we bought it, when we bought QEP, we've put up for sale right away. Unfortunately, the regulatory environment took a little longer to get it close, but generally, I think we're happy with the deal, is happy with the deal and our cost structure comes down a little bit in Q4 and into 2022. Yes. Yeah. At least half of that goes back to shareholders. Yes, I mean, I think the key value that's up the buyback is going to be opportunistic, not problematic. And as Charles said in his prepared remarks, you think about the buyback in terms of what is NAV at mid-cycle oil prices. Now we can have a long debate about where mid-cycle oil prices are going. But one quarter end, we're not willing to underwrite mid-cycle oil prices higher than we've seen in the last 5 years. I think the key is that the buybacks out there as a weapon for us at our disposal. But overall 50% of cash flows, free cash flow is getting returns. And if we don't get through the buyback in the quarter, there are lots of ups and downs in this industry. We don't get through the buyback in one particular quarter we're going to make our shareholders hold with a variable dividend, the quarter following. Yeah. And that's a good problem to have. And considering where were this summer when we had low 70's oil and the stock was 30%, 40% below where it is. I think we're in a great position right now and I think there are opportunities on the buyback side. And we look forward to not being blacked out in a day or two and getting back after. Yes, Doug, just to add to that, it's all good. It's hard to think back just 12 months ago when oil price was half of what it is today. And so we know that we're in a volatile industry and we think being cautious and also providing our shareholders the maximum flexibility is still the prudent way to run the business and I hope that the answers to the capital allocation question you just asked demonstrate that they were trying to be prudent in generating maximum shareholder returns. Thank you, Derrick. Well there is one thing that I think we have to watch very carefully and that's the discipline that the public Companies demonstrate in their earnings call now and again in February. Because it's really -- if a Company comes out there and starts growing, even though I've been very demonstrative that the world doesn't need that growth right now. But if a Company comes out of starts growing and gets recognized in the stock market for that growth, then that's going to change the calculus for our board and how we allocate capital towards growth. Again, I think if you look at the macro conditions, post-pandemic, we need 100 million barrels a day of demand reestablished. We're probably getting close there. More importantly, we need to see the surplus capacity, whatever that number is and the OpEx plus countries being absorbed in the world's energy equation. And then third lead, you need to see kind of the 5-year average of global inventories return. And it's unlikely you will see all 3 of those triangulate precisely, but I think you need to look at the price of oil when those indicators are all pointing at each other. And if the price of world is $70 or $80 a barrel, when those things are pointed each other, that probably means we're in good shape in terms of supply and demand. If on the other hand, oil price is significantly higher than those indicators pointing at each other. Then that's probably our first sign that the world is calling for more -- for more oil. But even having said that, our board is dedicated to making sure that we're allocating capital that's going to generate the greatest return to our stockholders. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've rapidly transitioned from a Company that consumes capital for growth to now one that is distributing capital. And we're looking at holding production flat and we're looking at growing per-share measures while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. And we think that's a prudent way to run our business. No. Almost a 100% of our Midland Basin pads or 4 wells or more. And the benefit of simul - frac, you've got to have an even number of wells, given that you're running 2, basically 2 careers at the same time. So less apparent in the Delaware. After Delaware, we're probably 50% 2 well or 4 well plus, and 80% 2 well plus, and the Midland, it's almost a 100% 4 well plus. Thank you, Derrick. Good morning, David. Yeah, that's good. That's a good point, part of that part of the buyback work that we did when we announced it was, we looked at how much capital does it take to grow the business 5% a year for the next 5 years or grow the business 10% a year for the next 5 years versus shrink the business by 5 or 10% a year in terms of share count over the next 5 years. And the law of large numbers kept us up to on the growth side, but on the buyback side of the shrink side, it started to get easier to grow per-share metrics year 2 and 3. And obviously it's stock price dependent, but that was along the work that we did. We do our shareholders own more reserves per share, production per share, a longer inventory life per share. With the buyback versus trying to just follow into the ground and oversupply market that's already pretty fragile. Thank you, David. Well, I think generally right, got outperformed guidance on oil production, which we've done this year. But what we've said all year is that, if we are doing better than we thought, we're going to cut capital. And that's what we've done in 2021. And I think that's essentially the goal for 2022, even in the face of some inflationary pressures. Thank you, Scott. Yeah we heard that before Paul and we've recognized it. Fortunately, the mother ship has gotten very large and so there's less leakage to the subsidiaries, but both have been important to us over the last -- for the last half decade. Thanks, Paul. Thanks, Leo. Hey, Charles. Yeah. I think is just purely we get blacked out. We get blacked out 10 days before the quarter ends and were blacked out until a couple of days after earnings. So we'll assess where we are in a couple of days and be back after it. Thanks, Charles. I think we're just going to keep following the prices of the bonds and try to get below may call as we can. If not, the may call is not too restrictive on something like our '24s as you get in the late ' 22, but certainly not looking to take out anything past 2029. I like 500 as a minimum, we kind of said that over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's a good starting point for us. Thanks Harry. Yes. The methane rules. I think we still have to see how the final document is written down if that continues as I've stated in my prepared remarks to focus on methane intensity. We're going to reduce that by 70% from 2019 levels by 2024. So depends on where the threshold is, but I've been very pleased with the progress we've made already on reducing methane intensity. And in fact, we've got 20+ million dollars allocated next year to continue those efforts to reduce methane intensity. And if we do things right, hopefully we will be below the threshold, by which the methane intensity applies. And look OpEx is going to do what OpEx is going to do. I've said we've transitioned in it that Virbac transition very rapidly from consuming capital, returning capital. And focused on the increase or the growth that we're seeing in per-share metrics. And I've outlined as the macro elements by which the world will be calling on more growth. And I think every quarter that we go through, Diamondback, it's board is demonstrating our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. And we're doing that right now about generating all this free cash flow this way. But free cash flow is coming to us and our commitment to return at least 50% of that back to the shareholders. Thanks, Paul. Thank you again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you got any questions, please contact us using the information provided."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentations there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advice that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Chelsea [ph]. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO and Daniel Wesson, EVP of Operations. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter extending its track record of operational excellence. I am proud of everything our teams been able to accomplish this year by pushing the boundaries of our current thought processes and embracing new technologies and playbooks, many of which have come from the personnel we've added through our acquisitions. Nowhere is that more evident than on drilling and completion side of the business, where we continue to lower costs and improve cycle times. We\u2019ve decreased our drill times for the spud to total depth of over 30% and are averaging just over 10 days to drill a two-mile wells in the Permian -- in the Midland basin. On the completion side, we're now running a three simul-frac crews, which lower our downtime and improve our pad efficiencies. We are currently completing approximately 2800 lateral feet per day in the Midland basin, an improvement of nearly 70% as compared to our early zipper-frac designs.  All of these operational advances translate to our ability to do more with less. We are seeing some inflation on diesel, steel and other materials, our ability to continually improve operationally and become more efficient has more than offset these cost increases and/or leading-edge D, C&E cost continue to be at the low end of our guidance range. As a result, we're decreasing the number of rigs and crews we need to execute this year's capital plan and are reducing our full-year capital guidance by $100 million or down 6% from prior expectations. On the production side, our wells have outperformed expectations this year. As a result, we are slightly increasing our Permian oil production guidance, which should not be taken as a conscious decision to grow. As we look at supply and demand fundamentals, oil supply is still purposefully being withheld from the market and we continue to believe there's not a call on U.S. shale production growth. We will continue therefore to target flat oil production for the foreseeable future and plan to do that by completing less wells than originally planned this year. These operational highlights coupled with a supportive macro backdrop led to record free cash flow generation for Diamondback. During the second quarter, we generated $578 million in free cash flow or $3.18 per diluted share. To put this into perspective, we entered 2021 anticipating roughly this amount of free cash flow for the full year. We've already put this cash to work by calling and paying down over $600 million of callable debt so far this year with over $600 million more expected later this year when our 2023 notes become callable. In total, this debt reduction will reduce cash interest expense by almost $40 million annually. We continue to emphasize that reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns are not mutually exclusive. And we proved this point again by increasing our quarterly dividend by 12.5% from $0.40 a share to $0.45 a share or $1.80 annualized. This put this puts our year-to-date dividend growth at 20% above 2020 levels. At Diamondback, we prefer to talk about our current performance rather than future promises. However, our performance has allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our base dividend. And we now feel it's appropriate to put up some goal posts as it relates to additional return of capital in 2022 given the current free cash flow outlook at strip pricing. Our plan is to distribute 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2022. This form of additional capital return will be decided by the board at the appropriate time, but we intend to be flexible based on which opportunities we believe present the best return to our stockholders, the owners of our company. Remember, our strategy is unchanged since 2018 when we initiated our base dividend. This additional clarity is simply a evolution of our guidance and also reflective of the maturation of our business. A lot can happen now between now and the end of the year, but we feel we are well positioned to take advantage of the current commodity price environment and deliver differential free cash flow in 2022. Our capital efficiency improvement allows us to maintain an elevated base level of Permian oil production through 2022 by spending approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion of total capital. The continued improvement in a realized pricing and our low cash cost structure combined to form a best-in-class cash margin, which we plan to protect as we layer on hedges that are focused on protecting extreme downside allowing our shareholders to participate in commodity price upside. Turning to ESG. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. Flaring continues to be one of the biggest drivers of our CO2 emissions. And while we've made significant progress since 2019, we still have work to do. Our target in 2021 is to flare less than 1% of gross gas produced and in the first half of the year we were above that number. Now this is primarily due to the integration of the QEP assets and we expect this metric to improve as we build out additional infrastructure in the Midland basin and close the Williston divestiture later this quarter. We have also begun two pilot projects utilizing tankless and limited tank facility designs. While the first tankless facility is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter. We've already had two successful limited tank design pilots. On average this design reduced our CO2 emissions from our storage tanks by more than 90%. Because of this success, we've elected to extend this pilot to another five facilities in the back half of this year and expand to an additional 15 facilities in 2022. Lastly, we are continuing to build out our electrical substations, which will help minimize emissions from combustion equipment, primarily generators and gas engine driven compressors. We are working to remove or replace over 200 of these units by 2023. The combination of these efforts positioned us well to meet our commitment of reducing our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% as compared to 2019 figures by 2024. The second quarter exceeded our expectations and exemplified why Diamondback is a leader in the industry. Our people continue to innovate, making us more environmentally responsible and efficient uniquely positioning us for the future. Our record free cash flow generation allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our dividend all the while positioning us for robust shareholder returns next year. We are delivering on our exploit and return strategy, continuing to focus on maintaining Permian oil volumes, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning, Travis and team. Travis, I want to start a little bit maybe away from the print. But to get a little bit of your thoughts on kind of the A&D market. We sensed a bit of a fear factor regarding your stock and the potential for Diamondback to engage in larger scale M&A with some of the larger packages apparently on the block. So, I just wanted to maybe you could start and maybe remind investors on your approach to A&D? And how you kind of balance, call it the general scarcity of Tier 1 opportunities in the A&D market versus just economics and returns?\nTravis Stice: Sure. A lot of questions contained in there. But just generally, it feels like a seller's market out there. Our M&A focus is really intense around selling non-core assets. And look, one of the most important jobs that we have as management is allocating capital. And when you look at kind of a mid-cycle oil price and we kind of use 50 [ph], 15 for NGLs and $2 for gas. The NAV of our stock prices is much higher than where we are today. So, if that backdrop persists, best use of our capital is not in the M&A market, it's rather in the -- even buying back our own stock. But look, we've been very clear what forms, what our decision framework and our acquisition frameworks look like. And we've articulated that in every earnings call. But today, just doesn't feel like that's the right thing to do. So well focus is simply around monetizing non-core assets and really looking hard at our business. So I really like the way our forward plan looks with our existing inventories.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks for that. And just my follow-up. You did raise your production guidance for the back half of the year relative to consensus and kind of our model if you -- even if you back out the Bakken. I was wondering, Travis and team, you comment on what drove that? And just general, your expectations around 2022? It sounds like we're -- it's a 1.8 billion to hold, call it, 220 [ph] flat next year, but I just want to get your sense around your second half outlook and thoughts around 2022?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I'll take this year first. We are going to close the bakken a little bit later than we expected due to external approvals. And so therefore, we kind of raised our full year guide by about 2500 barrels a day, which is two months of the bakken contribution. But above that we also raised our overall guide for the year up 2% and that's really on an apples-to-apples basis versus our Q1 guide. And really I think impetus for that is some Permian outperformance early in the year. And therefore, I think we're comfortable raising our Permian guidance on oil to 218 to 222 from 216 to 220. And as Travis said, we're not in growth mode, but the wells this year have outperformed and we've cut more capital on the CapEx side than we have raised the production side. So, generally completing 10 fewer wells this year than originally planned in the Permian production up a couple percent, but more importantly, capital down 6% or 7% from where we were before. And that translates to the 2022 plan, which is you know in dark pencil right now. But flat is kind of the case we're modeling. And I think generally holding that 218,000 to 222,000 barrels a day and the Permian flat with as little capital as possible is how we see it today. This -- the number we posted yesterday kind of bakes in a little bit of service cost inflation as we know our business partners on that side are going to be able to push price a little bit. But generally really excited about a high Midland basin percentage of wells completed next year that keeps production flat in a very capital efficient manner.\nArun Jayaram: Super helpful. Thanks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Arun.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. Travis, maybe we could start on the 50% 2022 number that you threw out there in terms of the return of cash flow. And do you see the potential for that to grow over time as balance sheet strengthens? And then any early thoughts in terms of what the right mechanism is to return that capital, whether it's through dividends or buybacks especially with the stock yielding the free cash flow yield that it is right now?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Certainly, what we try to do is allow the flexibility to make that decision when that point occurs. Because we want to make that decision on what creates the greatest return for our shareholders. And if you look at 2022 and you have plus 20% free cash flow yield, that would tend to think it's a more of a stock buyback. But look, we're going to maintain flexibility and try to do what we've always done which create the framework that generates the greatest shareholder returns. And what that number does over time? Look, Neil, I couldn't be more excited about the forward outlook of the company. Our -- what -- even like I said at that mid-cycle oil price and break-even cost of around $32 a barrel, we're making a lot of really good free cash flow on a daily basis as we look out into the future. And we'll make that decision when that cash comes through the doors as to what we're going to do with it. But we've signaled very clearly an evolution in our guidance by talking about you know 50% going back to the shareholders. And that that evolution and guidance is also reflective of a maturation of our business.\nNeil Mehta: And Travis, can you talk a little bit about the cost structure of the business. How do you see that evolving over time, not only the back half of the year, but as you get into 2022, and all the different moving pieces as it relates to both cost and capital efficiency?\nTravis Stice: I have to be honest. Our operations organization just continues to just surprise me. I mean, we were -- yes, I feel like we're already the best and doing what we do out here and drilling and completing these wells. And these guys came up with some clear fluid drilling technology that that came over quite honestly from the QEP acquisition. And they've knocked out significant cost. I think it's on slide 10 of our deck. And that just continues to surprise me. Because we're able to back out capital in the next six months of the year, because improve capital efficiencies against the backdrop of increasing cost of goods and services. I don't know that it's reasonable, but you can always forecast efficiencies going up and cost going down and certainly I don't think it's prudent to issue guidance that way. But I'm really impressed with the way our organization continues to lean into doing more with less.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I think, generally, the step change that the team has made in drilling times is going to be permanent, right? And that's going to stay with us through 2022 and beyond. And basically we can do -- what we once had to do with ten rigs with eight now in the Midland basin. And that's where the majority of our capitals can be allocated for the foreseeable future.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Kaes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Morning, guys. My first question is also around your comment of your plan to return 50% of free cash flow next year. Really, Travis or Kaes, I'm just wondering -- I'm wondering, will this be more of a backward looking formula or I guess more specifically what approach will you all use for determining the timing and the type of shareholder return?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Neal, good question. I think it come -- really comes down to a variable dividend or share buyback. I think if it's a variable dividend, it'll be backward looking the quarter that we announced will pay for the quarter prior. But if it's a buyback, I think we'll do a little math on how much free cash we're generating essentially per day and buyback that much tough [ph] on a consistent basis. So I think the board and Travis are very focused on which one of those provides the best return to shareholders at the time. And I don't think the answers one or the other for a permanent period of time. There's going to be flexibility to go between those. I think the only thing that is sacrosanct is the base dividend and continuing to grow the base dividend.\nNeal Dingmann: Great. Glad you're staying flexible there. And then my second question pertains to your comment in the release over the flat 2022 production expectation versus the 4Q with the just slightly higher spin. I guess on that, what I understand some of this is driven by a change of ducts and QEP going for -- a QEP and Guidon I should say going forward. Could you speak to your expectations for 2022 baseline production decline? And maybe the rig and frac spreads involved in this and any other notable drivers sort of that your expectations you're using to achieve this?\nTravis Stice: Yes. So, I'll start with the with the number, 10% to 15% more capital, while that's an increase versus this year. I think what's forgotten is that Guidon and QEP closed at the end of Q1, so we didn't have a full quarter of their capital contribution. So, that's a portion of the 10% to 15% increase I'd say about half of it. And also the other half is, we did have a nice DUC benefit if you see, we're completing 270 wells and drilling 220 this year. So that's about another $100 million benefit. Because when we're running as many rigs as we were into the downturn, we decided to not pay early termination fees and instead build the DUC backlog, which was the best use of investor dollars at the time and we're taking advantage of that a little bit this year. So, I think generally from a crew and rig count perspective, we dropped two rigs this quarter. We'll probably bring those two rigs back. But we'll probably need somewhere around 11 or 12 rigs next year and three simul-frac crews and maybe a fourth spot crew to execute on that plan, which is a testament to how efficient the operations team has gotten here.\nNeal Dingmann: Very good. Thanks for the details.\nTravis Stice: Thanks Neal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.\nGail Nicholson: Good morning. You guys have demonstrated a very strong commitment to ESG. On the water recycling front, you're sadly above the 2021 target already. Can you just talk about the future progression of water recycling? And can you remind me of the potential cost savings that exists in that world?\nTravis Stice: Yes. That's an important question. I think we are above our target so far this year with the shift to the Midland basin. We are going to need to build out some permanent infrastructure on the recycling side to be able to not only recycle the water, but also store produced water, so that we're not using --our freshwater intensity will go down on the Midland basin side. That process is underway. I expect that we have a nice solid connected system across kind of our sale, Robertson Ranch and Martin County positions by the middle to the end of next year. And that's going to allow us to up that number significantly. So, we've used 100% recycled water in the Delaware basin. Usually you're just pulling off the existing system. But on the Midland side you have less water production. So I think storing that produced water and being able to use it and reuse it downhaul is the next step in the evolution. And that should allow that target percentage to come up pretty dramatically over the next couple years.\nGail Nicholson: Great. And then on the electrification, efforts that you guys are doing. Can you talk about thoughts on the utilization of electric fracs fleets and drilling rigs? And then on the electrical substation work, there is an LOE benefit to that as well, correct?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I mean, the electrical substation work is pretty obvious by inspection. Because not only is it positive for ESG and run times, but it costs it costs significantly less than in field power generation. So, we've been working on that for the last few years. Now I think generally we've been ready to take power. It's taken a little bit of time for the co-ops to get to us. But by the end of this year, I think we'll line of sight to all of our major fields being on infield electrification. The issue we have on the frac and the drilling side is I think we're testing some drilling rigs on line power. They don't use up as much power as a frac crew. I think right now our frac crews are more focused on dual fuel and Tier 4 engine capabilities versus tying into line power. And I'll ask Danny if you want to add anything to that.\nDaniel Wesson: I think that's right. We on the efrac side of things, the issues generally been on the power generation side and how do we provide enough power to the fleet to running. There's some stuff -- our friends on the server side are working on hard to solve that issue. But we're certainly watching it close. And hope to be advancing there in the next couple years.\nGail Nicholson: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Leggett with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggett: Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Guys, one of the easiest ways to return value to investors is to pay down debt. Where do you see the right absolute level of debt when you consider the free cash flow you're throwing off right now?\nTravis Stice: Yes. That that's a good question. I think in the near term, paying off our 2023s and having enough cash to pay off our 2024s by kind of into next year, two years ahead of schedule, is feels like a very good place to be, with the break even as low as it is and with the delta between that and current oil prices and us not stepping on the accelerator to grow that does give you more flexibility on the free cash side to build the cash balance and take out these bullet maturities when they come due. But I think in the near term, handling everything prior to 2025 puts us in a really good position. Put this in a gross debt position in the low $4 billions and basically a turn of leverage with a lot of free cash coming to both the shareholders and to debt reduction.\nDoug Leggett: Great. Thanks for that. And yes, I think slide 10 is terrific. So thank you for including that in the deck. It's kind of my question case I guess is slide 10 my follow-up. If you're not growing production, if you're moving to the sustaining capital certain model for the time being, one has to imagine the underlying decline slows down some. So bottom line is what happens to that $32 break even if you hold the line on production going through the end of 2022? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nTravis Stice: Yes. Good question. Also Doug, I think it goes down, albeit less dramatically than it has in the past years. I think oil -- our oil decline rate quarter end to quarter end is kind of in the mid to lower 30s right now. I think it moves down kind of a percent or two a year if we keep continue to stay flat. But then also the other spend on infrastructure and midstream we're going to have a little tick-up in infrastructure and midstream next year with the Sale and Robertson Ranch development that we're going to have that came with no real infrastructure. So that spin comes down as well. So I think, generally we'll keep pushing it down by a buck or two a year. And that gives us a lot of flexibility to do a lot of things with debt pay down and free cash return to shareholders.\nDoug Leggett: Terrific. Thank Travis.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. So the base dividend has been a core pathway for Diamondback's return cash to shareholders. So definitely nice to see another bump today. How do you think about the appropriate level for the base dividend over time? Is there a certain percentage of cash flow that you target at a certain oil price? And does this percentage change as you deliver? How do you think about the base dividend?\nTravis Stice: Yes, Scott. When you go back and look at the way the board has previously communicated this commitment. We've talked about having a base dividend that somewhat approximates the S&P yields. And then anything above that is another form of shareholder return. So that 2.5% something like that base yield is sort of what we target for that base dividend.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I think on top of that, we think about our break even too, right? So as our break even comes down over time that gives you a little more flexibility to pay the dividend right now. 2022 dividend breakeven is at 35 a barrel WTI. As I alluded to in the last question, if the break even comes down a little bit that gives you a little more flexibility on the base, because like we said earlier in the call the base dividend is sacrosanct and that needs to be protected at all costs.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then just turning back to the 2022 plan, at least the maintenance plan. I may have missed it earlier. But is there a TIL count or obviously there will be. But what is the TIL count at the maintenance program given the acquisitions and productivity gains that you guys have seen?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I mean, it's generally flat to where we are right now and where our pace will be in the second half of the year, I mean, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. But generally, we're in the kind of 65 to 75 TILs a quarter and 75 or 80 of those are going to be in the Midland basin.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: Hey, good morning all and congrats on your strong quarter and update.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, regarding your volume outperformance during Q2, are there one to two factors that you would attribute to that production outperformance?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Derrick, I think generally the new wells that that we brought on the legacy Diamondback position are seeing the benefits of the downturn last year and reallocating capital to more on the Midland basin, but two our best returning assets across the portfolio. So generally, we're seeing early time is outperformance there. A good quarter all around. I mean, even the base production base was -- didn't suffer from a lot of weather or unforeseen events. So, I think generally on the positive side the capital efficiency not only on the cost side, but on the performance is improving and we're pretty excited about what the rest of the year and 2022 holds given the development we're going to have on the assets that we acquired from QEP and Guidon.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And as my follow-up perhaps for Travis. How concerned are you with the recent ramp in private activity in the Permian from the perspective of inflationary pressures and from the perspective of a potential breakdown in industry capital discipline?\nTravis Stice: So, that's a real interesting question, Derrick. there's no doubt that the privates out here in the Permian are really leading into this higher commodity price And notwithstanding the fact that the forward curve is $20 disconnected from today's price. But there's a couple of things that I think should be considered. One is, while some privates do have Tier 1 assets, a lot of the privates or more in the Tier 1.5 or Tier 2-ish and they're not quite as productive. But the reality is that the effect on both Permian production and on costs increases is not zero. It's just going to be -- it's a little bit too early to see what the effect is going to be. But I think the more quarters that pass, where public companies are exercising the discipline of flat production, I think is what our what our industry needs. And the privates will have an impact on the overall equation, but I think the macro element won't really change.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: And hopefully the longevity of that impact as well given the depth of inventory and on the private side.\nTravis Stice: Right.\nDerrick Whitfield: That's great update and thanks again for your time.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.\nLeo Mariani: Hey guys, wanted to jump in a little bit to the expense side of the equation here. Certainly, I know that you guys closed QEP and Guidon later in 1Q. But certainly notice that some of your expense items in the second quarter on a per BOE basis kind of picked up versus 1Q? I guess most notably your cash G&A, your LOE and even your transport cost. Just want to get a sense. Where there's some kind of one-time items as you're kind of flushing through the integration here that might have hit some of those numbers in which you should expect the per barrel cost to start to kind of drop and all those categories in the second half. Any help you can give us there?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, surely. Good question. With the addition of the bakken assets, those assets come with a much different cost structure than our traditional Permian assets. So on the LOE and the GP&T side, a little pickup there from the contribution on the bakken -- from the bakken, excuse me. We'll say, Permian LOE still remained in that $4-ish range, so you can get a feel for what the bakken contribution was. In the quarter, I would expect that to continue in Q3. On the G&A side, we did have a transition period for a good amount of the QEP employees. That transition period kind of wanes off in the back half of the year. So I think generally, G&A ticks down slightly in the back half of the year.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Now, that's helpful for sure. And I guess just to take a harder look at your production guidance here. Looking at your third quarter oil guide, if I just compare that to kind of your actual second quarter 2021 oil number, it looks like volumes come down a little bit. I know you guys have kind of talked about holding it flat. Is that maybe just kind of some seasonality or just some kind of random variance there in the number. But generally speaking, you're trying to do your best, keep it flat?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I think Q2 was a great quarter Leo. And I think we've been very vocal about no production growth needed from the U.S. So I think we're resetting that baseline back to where we were originally in Q2. So, I think there's a little bit outperformance. And I think like we've said, kind of through the year we'd rather sacrifice capital or cut capital in lieu of growing production. So if you keep beating production estimates and raising your baseline for staying flat, that's really growth. And so, we really don't want that. So generally, I think we're pleased that we can use the 218 to 222 oil baseline for the Permian for Q3 and Q4 into 2022. And hopefully the ops teams continue to outperform expectations and under promise and over deliver a bit.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That makes sense. So it sounds like there's some element of you folks, basically had very strong well performance in the last couple quarters, and that's just not something you can necessarily guide to every quarter as well?\nTravis Stice: That's right. I mean, I think we expect to continue to do well. And we expect continued capital efficiency improvement particularly with the new development we have planned in the Midland basin. But this industry is about under promising and over delivering.\nLeo Mariani: Now that makes a lot of sense. And then just lastly on asset sales. You folks obviously talked about it being a bit of a seller's market. I know you're working hard on closing the bakken divestiture. But is there anything else in your purview that you're looking to maybe prune late this year or into next year?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I mean, I think we've had some inbounds on some non-core assets that don't compete for capital in the next 10 years of our development plan. And so, I think generally there is surprisingly a lot of private capital looking to do things again, in E&P what a twist from six or nine months ago. But I think generally if someone wants to pay for value for something that has no value to our shareholders on a PV basis we'll take that call. And I think there's a couple of areas that that might be the case and no guarantees, we're not a for seller, but we would do what's right for our shareholders on selling some of these non-core assets.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Thanks guys.\nTravis Stice: Thanks Leo.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one's on hedging if you just remind us on your philosophy overall there. There's obviously a lot of capacity to add as we look to the back half of the next year with the bulk of the additions earlier in the year which maybe speaks to the strategy already as well as to how the curve sits. But just wanted to get the latest as you continue to improve the balance sheet which obviously serves as a natural projection of volatility as that gets better and better?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Jeff, great question. I think we see the back relation in the curve. So it's hard for us to hedge further out than kind of the next nine to 12 months. So I think generally, we'd like to be close to 50%, 60% hedged late going into a quarter and build that relatively consistently over the three or four quarters prior to that quarter. What we have done is try to keep these wide two-way callers to not take away upside for our investors. And I think as we get closer to quarters and the time value of money goes down some sort of deferred premium puts makes sense to layer on top of the wide two-way callers. I think generally, we feel really good about where the balance sheets going to be at the end of the year. The free cash flow generation even at 50 TI next year. And so that's kind of the downside we're trying to protect.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, just wanted to see if there's anything you could dig in on a bit more just on the moving pieces on cost inflation that you spoke to. Just if there's anything incremental you could speak on what's moving currently on the services side of things in particular?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Well, it's been very visible on the steel, diesel side and the raw material side. I think I think generally the steel inflation in our opinion needs to slow down at some point. But I think that -- the cost inflation is going to flip to the more service oriented lines on the labor side and on the pieces of the service world that that go up with recount. So I think we've held off long enough on that front. And I think the service industry is able to push a little price here on that side. But I think most importantly what we've done on the Midland basin side is the lowering of days to TD has counteracted any of that increase so far.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nTravis Stice: Thanks Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Travis and Kaes, and the rest of the team there. I'd like to ask one more question maybe from a different direction on that on the 50% of cash -- free cash return to shareholders in 2022. I recognize that that you guys are going to keep your options open. You're going to have to observe the conditions present, then when you make that decision. But can you share any kind of preferences or maybe even a framework since that's an idea that you guys have used on how you're going to approach that decision? And I'm kind of thinking along the lines of -- the books will tell you that share buybacks are more tax efficient. But share buybacks have a little bit of a bad reputation not just in the E&P business, but also in other industries as being pro cyclical. So how are you guys going to approach that question? And are there any preferences for how you do it?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I mean, that's a really good question, Charles and it's a highly debated topic internally on pro cyclical share buybacks. I think what's changed a little bit in the business is we're no longer growing as fast as we can and spending capital to grow and return cash to shareholders. I think generally now with capital being constrained to maintenance, you have a lot of flexibility above that. At the end of the day, we fundamentally have to look at what our NAV looks like on a mid-cycle oil price and mid-cycle commodity price environment. And if we're trading below that even with oil where it is then the buyback makes sense, because that return you know on a PV basis is a better return to buy in the stock market than buying the ground. So that's kind of the analysis that's going to go into it. Today it feels like a buyback is the right way to go. But again, it's still August 2nd and 3rd today and we have some time to make that decision.\nTravis Stice: Yes, Charles. I can't emphasize enough from the board's perspective. That decision is going to be made on what drives the greatest shareholder value. And yes, there's technical questions that need to be addressed. But at the end of the day our responsibility is to generate differential shareholder value. And that's still the problem statement that we'll solve with our shareholder return program.\nCharles Meade: That is helpful. Thank you for that. And then a follow-up. This -- you feel free to punt on this if you don't think it's productive. But Travis, you spent a fair amount of your preparing remarks talking about your ESG and specifically I was -- my attention was caught by your talk about this new tankless -- this tankless design. And I'm curious, when you look at the cost, the incremental cost of that, have you have you matched that up against the cost of -- perhaps, you guys talked in past quarters about buying carbon offset credits. Is that a comparison you guys make? And if you do how do they stack up?\nTravis Stice: Yes. It's part of the calculus, but it's not an either war, right? The fundamental decision to move into the carbon credits was a recognition that we're doing things operationally in the field that's going to get us to where we want to be over the next couple of years. But this is much more tactical. This is a specific strategy that we're deploying that has meaningful CO2 and flaring reductions associated with it. That's why we share the statistics of reducing emissions by 90% on our atmospheric tanks. We think it's really a good way to go. And we want to try to be as communicative as we can on this. Because this isn't a Diamondback secret nor is it something that we're trying to position Diamondback favorably for. This is an industry-wide issue and I think the solutions need to be industry-wide as well. And we want to be as collaboratively -- collaborative as we can be and share these learnings that we have. And this is a very good form to be able to share this technique. In fact some of these came probably from ideas that we got from other operators. So look, I'm very, very proud of the efforts and the results that Diamondback has generated particularly since we drew a line in the sand in 2019. And I'm also really proud about what our industry is doing as well. And the narrative has certainly moved away from us or maybe we didn't take advantage of it as an industry to control that narrative. But we've got to do a better job of saying we recognize what it is we're doing, has an environmental impact and more importantly that we are spending dollars in applying that same innovative thought processes that got us horizontal drilling and fracking and the success we've enjoyed by that. So we're really good problem solvers and we're going to communicate each quarter ways that we're solving this problem on our environmental responsibility objectives.\nCharles Meade: Great. Thanks for that all that commentary.\nTravis Stice: You bet. Thanks Charles.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Travis Stice, CEO.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again for everyone participating in today's call.

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter extending its track record of operational excellence. I am proud of everything our teams been able to accomplish this year by pushing the boundaries of our current thought processes and embracing new technologies and playbooks, many of which have come from the personnel we've added through our acquisitions. Nowhere is that more evident than on drilling and completion side of the business, where we continue to lower costs and improve cycle times. We've decreased our drill times for the spud to total depth of over 30% and are averaging just over 10 days to drill a two-mile wells in the Permian -- in the Midland basin. On the completion side, we're now running a three simul-frac crews, which lower our downtime and improve our pad efficiencies. We are currently completing approximately 2800 lateral feet per day in the Midland basin, an improvement of nearly 70% as compared to our early zipper-frac designs.  All of these operational advances translate to our ability to do more with less. We are seeing some inflation on diesel, steel and other materials, our ability to continually improve operationally and become more efficient has more than offset these cost increases and/or leading-edge D, C&E cost continue to be at the low end of our guidance range. As a result, we're decreasing the number of rigs and crews we need to execute this year's capital plan and are reducing our full-year capital guidance by $100 million or down 6% from prior expectations. On the production side, our wells have outperformed expectations this year. As a result, we are slightly increasing our Permian oil production guidance, which should not be taken as a conscious decision to grow. As we look at supply and demand fundamentals, oil supply is still purposefully being withheld from the market and we continue to believe there's not a call on U.S. shale production growth. We will continue therefore to target flat oil production for the foreseeable future and plan to do that by completing less wells than originally planned this year. These operational highlights coupled with a supportive macro backdrop led to record free cash flow generation for Diamondback. During the second quarter, we generated $578 million in free cash flow or $3.18 per diluted share. To put this into perspective, we entered 2021 anticipating roughly this amount of free cash flow for the full year. We've already put this cash to work by calling and paying down over $600 million of callable debt so far this year with over $600 million more expected later this year when our 2023 notes become callable. In total, this debt reduction will reduce cash interest expense by almost $40 million annually. We continue to emphasize that reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns are not mutually exclusive. And we proved this point again by increasing our quarterly dividend by 12.5% from $0.40 a share to $0.45 a share or $1.80 annualized. This put this puts our year-to-date dividend growth at 20% above 2020 levels. At Diamondback, we prefer to talk about our current performance rather than future promises. However, our performance has allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our base dividend. And we now feel it's appropriate to put up some goal posts as it relates to additional return of capital in 2022 given the current free cash flow outlook at strip pricing. Our plan is to distribute 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2022. This form of additional capital return will be decided by the board at the appropriate time, but we intend to be flexible based on which opportunities we believe present the best return to our stockholders, the owners of our company. Remember, our strategy is unchanged since 2018 when we initiated our base dividend. This additional clarity is simply a evolution of our guidance and also reflective of the maturation of our business. A lot can happen now between now and the end of the year, but we feel we are well positioned to take advantage of the current commodity price environment and deliver differential free cash flow in 2022. Our capital efficiency improvement allows us to maintain an elevated base level of Permian oil production through 2022 by spending approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion of total capital. The continued improvement in a realized pricing and our low cash cost structure combined to form a best-in-class cash margin, which we plan to protect as we layer on hedges that are focused on protecting extreme downside allowing our shareholders to participate in commodity price upside. Turning to ESG. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. Flaring continues to be one of the biggest drivers of our CO2 emissions. And while we've made significant progress since 2019, we still have work to do. Our target in 2021 is to flare less than 1% of gross gas produced and in the first half of the year we were above that number. Now this is primarily due to the integration of the QEP assets and we expect this metric to improve as we build out additional infrastructure in the Midland basin and close the Williston divestiture later this quarter. We have also begun two pilot projects utilizing tankless and limited tank facility designs. While the first tankless facility is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter. We've already had two successful limited tank design pilots. On average this design reduced our CO2 emissions from our storage tanks by more than 90%. Because of this success, we've elected to extend this pilot to another five facilities in the back half of this year and expand to an additional 15 facilities in 2022. Lastly, we are continuing to build out our electrical substations, which will help minimize emissions from combustion equipment, primarily generators and gas engine driven compressors. We are working to remove or replace over 200 of these units by 2023. The combination of these efforts positioned us well to meet our commitment of reducing our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% as compared to 2019 figures by 2024. The second quarter exceeded our expectations and exemplified why Diamondback is a leader in the industry. Our people continue to innovate, making us more environmentally responsible and efficient uniquely positioning us for the future. Our record free cash flow generation allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our dividend all the while positioning us for robust shareholder returns next year. We are delivering on our exploit and return strategy, continuing to focus on maintaining Permian oil volumes, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Sure. A lot of questions contained in there. But just generally, it feels like a seller's market out there. Our M&A focus is really intense around selling non-core assets. And look, one of the most important jobs that we have as management is allocating capital. And when you look at kind of a mid-cycle oil price and we kind of use 50 [ph], 15 for NGLs and $2 for gas. The NAV of our stock prices is much higher than where we are today. So, if that backdrop persists, best use of our capital is not in the M&A market, it's rather in the -- even buying back our own stock. But look, we've been very clear what forms, what our decision framework and our acquisition frameworks look like. And we've articulated that in every earnings call. But today, just doesn't feel like that's the right thing to do. So well focus is simply around monetizing non-core assets and really looking hard at our business. So I really like the way our forward plan looks with our existing inventories. Yes. I'll take this year first. We are going to close the bakken a little bit later than we expected due to external approvals. And so therefore, we kind of raised our full year guide by about 2500 barrels a day, which is two months of the bakken contribution. But above that we also raised our overall guide for the year up 2% and that's really on an apples-to-apples basis versus our Q1 guide. And really I think impetus for that is some Permian outperformance early in the year. And therefore, I think we're comfortable raising our Permian guidance on oil to 218 to 222 from 216 to 220. And as Travis said, we're not in growth mode, but the wells this year have outperformed and we've cut more capital on the CapEx side than we have raised the production side. So, generally completing 10 fewer wells this year than originally planned in the Permian production up a couple percent, but more importantly, capital down 6% or 7% from where we were before. And that translates to the 2022 plan, which is you know in dark pencil right now. But flat is kind of the case we're modeling. And I think generally holding that 218,000 to 222,000 barrels a day and the Permian flat with as little capital as possible is how we see it today. This -- the number we posted yesterday kind of bakes in a little bit of service cost inflation as we know our business partners on that side are going to be able to push price a little bit. But generally really excited about a high Midland basin percentage of wells completed next year that keeps production flat in a very capital efficient manner. Thank you, Arun. Yes. Certainly, what we try to do is allow the flexibility to make that decision when that point occurs. Because we want to make that decision on what creates the greatest return for our shareholders. And if you look at 2022 and you have plus 20% free cash flow yield, that would tend to think it's a more of a stock buyback. But look, we're going to maintain flexibility and try to do what we've always done which create the framework that generates the greatest shareholder returns. And what that number does over time? Look, Neil, I couldn't be more excited about the forward outlook of the company. Our -- what -- even like I said at that mid-cycle oil price and break-even cost of around $32 a barrel, we're making a lot of really good free cash flow on a daily basis as we look out into the future. And we'll make that decision when that cash comes through the doors as to what we're going to do with it. But we've signaled very clearly an evolution in our guidance by talking about you know 50% going back to the shareholders. And that that evolution and guidance is also reflective of a maturation of our business. I have to be honest. Our operations organization just continues to just surprise me. I mean, we were -- yes, I feel like we're already the best and doing what we do out here and drilling and completing these wells. And these guys came up with some clear fluid drilling technology that that came over quite honestly from the QEP acquisition. And they've knocked out significant cost. I think it's on slide 10 of our deck. And that just continues to surprise me. Because we're able to back out capital in the next six months of the year, because improve capital efficiencies against the backdrop of increasing cost of goods and services. I don't know that it's reasonable, but you can always forecast efficiencies going up and cost going down and certainly I don't think it's prudent to issue guidance that way. But I'm really impressed with the way our organization continues to lean into doing more with less. Yes. So, I'll start with the with the number, 10% to 15% more capital, while that's an increase versus this year. I think what's forgotten is that Guidon and QEP closed at the end of Q1, so we didn't have a full quarter of their capital contribution. So, that's a portion of the 10% to 15% increase I'd say about half of it. And also the other half is, we did have a nice DUC benefit if you see, we're completing 270 wells and drilling 220 this year. So that's about another $100 million benefit. Because when we're running as many rigs as we were into the downturn, we decided to not pay early termination fees and instead build the DUC backlog, which was the best use of investor dollars at the time and we're taking advantage of that a little bit this year. So, I think generally from a crew and rig count perspective, we dropped two rigs this quarter. We'll probably bring those two rigs back. But we'll probably need somewhere around 11 or 12 rigs next year and three simul-frac crews and maybe a fourth spot crew to execute on that plan, which is a testament to how efficient the operations team has gotten here. Thanks Neal. Yes. That's an important question. I think we are above our target so far this year with the shift to the Midland basin. We are going to need to build out some permanent infrastructure on the recycling side to be able to not only recycle the water, but also store produced water, so that we're not using --our freshwater intensity will go down on the Midland basin side. That process is underway. I expect that we have a nice solid connected system across kind of our sale, Robertson Ranch and Martin County positions by the middle to the end of next year. And that's going to allow us to up that number significantly. So, we've used 100% recycled water in the Delaware basin. Usually you're just pulling off the existing system. But on the Midland side you have less water production. So I think storing that produced water and being able to use it and reuse it downhaul is the next step in the evolution. And that should allow that target percentage to come up pretty dramatically over the next couple years. Yes. I mean, the electrical substation work is pretty obvious by inspection. Because not only is it positive for ESG and run times, but it costs it costs significantly less than in field power generation. So, we've been working on that for the last few years. Now I think generally we've been ready to take power. It's taken a little bit of time for the co-ops to get to us. But by the end of this year, I think we'll line of sight to all of our major fields being on infield electrification. The issue we have on the frac and the drilling side is I think we're testing some drilling rigs on line power. They don't use up as much power as a frac crew. I think right now our frac crews are more focused on dual fuel and Tier 4 engine capabilities versus tying into line power. And I'll ask Danny if you want to add anything to that. Yes. That that's a good question. I think in the near term, paying off our 2023s and having enough cash to pay off our 2024s by kind of into next year, two years ahead of schedule, is feels like a very good place to be, with the break even as low as it is and with the delta between that and current oil prices and us not stepping on the accelerator to grow that does give you more flexibility on the free cash side to build the cash balance and take out these bullet maturities when they come due. But I think in the near term, handling everything prior to 2025 puts us in a really good position. Put this in a gross debt position in the low $4 billions and basically a turn of leverage with a lot of free cash coming to both the shareholders and to debt reduction. Yes. Good question. Also Doug, I think it goes down, albeit less dramatically than it has in the past years. I think oil -- our oil decline rate quarter end to quarter end is kind of in the mid to lower 30s right now. I think it moves down kind of a percent or two a year if we keep continue to stay flat. But then also the other spend on infrastructure and midstream we're going to have a little tick-up in infrastructure and midstream next year with the Sale and Robertson Ranch development that we're going to have that came with no real infrastructure. So that spin comes down as well. So I think, generally we'll keep pushing it down by a buck or two a year. And that gives us a lot of flexibility to do a lot of things with debt pay down and free cash return to shareholders. Thank you, Doug. Yes, Scott. When you go back and look at the way the board has previously communicated this commitment. We've talked about having a base dividend that somewhat approximates the S&P yields. And then anything above that is another form of shareholder return. So that 2.5% something like that base yield is sort of what we target for that base dividend. Yes. I mean, it's generally flat to where we are right now and where our pace will be in the second half of the year, I mean, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. But generally, we're in the kind of 65 to 75 TILs a quarter and 75 or 80 of those are going to be in the Midland basin. Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Derrick. So, that's a real interesting question, Derrick. there's no doubt that the privates out here in the Permian are really leading into this higher commodity price And notwithstanding the fact that the forward curve is $20 disconnected from today's price. But there's a couple of things that I think should be considered. One is, while some privates do have Tier 1 assets, a lot of the privates or more in the Tier 1.5 or Tier 2-ish and they're not quite as productive. But the reality is that the effect on both Permian production and on costs increases is not zero. It's just going to be -- it's a little bit too early to see what the effect is going to be. But I think the more quarters that pass, where public companies are exercising the discipline of flat production, I think is what our what our industry needs. And the privates will have an impact on the overall equation, but I think the macro element won't really change. Right. Thank you, Derrick. That's right. I mean, I think we expect to continue to do well. And we expect continued capital efficiency improvement particularly with the new development we have planned in the Midland basin. But this industry is about under promising and over delivering. Yes. I mean, I think we've had some inbounds on some non-core assets that don't compete for capital in the next 10 years of our development plan. And so, I think generally there is surprisingly a lot of private capital looking to do things again, in E&P what a twist from six or nine months ago. But I think generally if someone wants to pay for value for something that has no value to our shareholders on a PV basis we'll take that call. And I think there's a couple of areas that that might be the case and no guarantees, we're not a for seller, but we would do what's right for our shareholders on selling some of these non-core assets. Thanks Leo. Thanks Jeff. Yes, Charles. I can't emphasize enough from the board's perspective. That decision is going to be made on what drives the greatest shareholder value. And yes, there's technical questions that need to be addressed. But at the end of the day our responsibility is to generate differential shareholder value. And that's still the problem statement that we'll solve with our shareholder return program. Yes. It's part of the calculus, but it's not an either war, right? The fundamental decision to move into the carbon credits was a recognition that we're doing things operationally in the field that's going to get us to where we want to be over the next couple of years. But this is much more tactical. This is a specific strategy that we're deploying that has meaningful CO2 and flaring reductions associated with it. That's why we share the statistics of reducing emissions by 90% on our atmospheric tanks. We think it's really a good way to go. And we want to try to be as communicative as we can on this. Because this isn't a Diamondback secret nor is it something that we're trying to position Diamondback favorably for. This is an industry-wide issue and I think the solutions need to be industry-wide as well. And we want to be as collaboratively -- collaborative as we can be and share these learnings that we have. And this is a very good form to be able to share this technique. In fact some of these came probably from ideas that we got from other operators. So look, I'm very, very proud of the efforts and the results that Diamondback has generated particularly since we drew a line in the sand in 2019. And I'm also really proud about what our industry is doing as well. And the narrative has certainly moved away from us or maybe we didn't take advantage of it as an industry to control that narrative. But we've got to do a better job of saying we recognize what it is we're doing, has an environmental impact and more importantly that we are spending dollars in applying that same innovative thought processes that got us horizontal drilling and fracking and the success we've enjoyed by that. So we're really good problem solvers and we're going to communicate each quarter ways that we're solving this problem on our environmental responsibility objectives. You bet. Thanks Charles. Thank you again for everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to effectively navigate a once-in-a-generation winter storm while keeping well costs and cash operating costs near all-time lows. We closed both the Guidon and QEP acquisitions in the first quarter and are very pleased with how the integration efforts are progressing. We are achieving our synergy targets ahead of schedule and in excess of the $60 million to $80 million of annual cost savings we highlighted when the deals were announced. Yesterday, we also announced 3 noncore asset divestitures for gross expected proceeds of $832 million. By selling these noncore acreage positions in such a timely and opportunistic manner, we were able to take advantage of a strong A&D market and generate attractive cash returns for Diamondback shareholders. We anticipate using the combined proceeds from these noncore asset sales to accelerate debt reduction. As we discussed last quarter, even though oil demand has shown signs of recovery from the depths of the global pandemic, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, primarily through the actions of OPEC+. As a result, we continue to believe we do not need production growth and will hold our pro forma fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat through 2021. Due to the complexity resulting from the timing of the QEP and Guidon acquisitions as well as the announced divestitures, we have instituted quarterly production and capital guidance for the first time. For the second quarter, we anticipate spending $350 million to $400 million in capital and producing 232,000 to 236,000 barrels of oil a day. This production range accounts for a full quarter of contribution from QEP's Williston asset and approximately 2 months of production from the announced noncore Permian asset sales. Looking at the full year of 2021, our free cash flow profile continues to improve. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $330 million of free cash flow, marking the third consecutive quarter of significant free cash generation. At current strip pricing and accounting for the Williston divestiture, we expect to generate approximately $1.4 billion in pre-dividend free cash flow this year at a reinvestment ratio of below 55%.  In March, we executed a successful tender offer and refinancing of all of QEP bonds and one of Diamondback's existing bonds. This refinancing equates to $40 million of annual interest expense savings and extended our average debt maturity by 3 years. Today, we have 3 debt maturities that are callable before the end of this year: $191 million due later this year, $650 million due in 2023 and $432 million due in 2025. We expect to use cash on hand from internally generated cash flow as well as proceeds from our asset sales to retire these 3 tranches of bonds, reducing our absolute debt load and further strengthening our balance sheet. Now turning to ESG. We recognize the importance of operating with the highest level of environmental responsibility and continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We flared 0.75% of our gross gas production in the first quarter, a decrease of over 85% from 2019. Flaring is the biggest driver of our CO2 emissions. And while we are happy with our progress on our legacy acreage, we still have significant work to do on our recently acquired positions as we move to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024. We've also committed to reducing our methane intensity by 70% over the same time frame. In the first quarter, we continued spending capital to retrofit our older tank batteries with air pneumatic devices as gas pneumatics account for 50% of our methane emissions. We also signed a contract to conduct quarterly flyovers of all of our tank batteries to more frequently check for equipment leaks, improving our maintenance practices. Our Net Zero Now initiative is also underway, which means every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have 0 net Scope 1 carbon emissions from January 1, 2021 forward. While we recognize we still had a carbon footprint, we have already purchased carbon credits to offset remaining emissions and ultimately plan to be a fast follower in investing in income-generating projects here in the United States that will more directly offset these remaining Scope 1 emissions. To finish, the first quarter was busy and productive. We generated substantial free cash flow, kept our capital and operating costs down, extended debt maturities, added Tier 1 inventory and divested noncore assets. All the while, our strategy remains the same: operate in a prudent and sustainable manner, spend maintenance capital to hold production flat and use future free cash flow to return cash to shareholders and reduce debt. With these comments complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann: Quite, you and the team, a bit emphatic about what I would call macro speaking that the world really does not need any more oil growth anytime soon. So my question is really pertaining to this. Do you all believe your operational program is as optimal at this lesser pace than if you had a more multi-rig larger frac plan in several of your areas and whether business have much impact on your cash cost?\nTravis Stice: Sure. I think if you look, Neal, just at our cash cost that we printed this quarter, you would say that there's not been any leakage or any cost pressure that were -- that has translated into execution slippage associated with the lower activity rate. I mean, Neal, if you look at rolling into 2020 before the global pandemic hit, we were running 23 drilling rigs and, I don't know, 8 or 9 frac spreads. That was a pretty quick pace. And I've actually been really pleased with -- as that pace was reduced, in some cases, dramatically last year. Even as we've entered into this year, we really seem to be at a pretty efficient frontier in both rig activity and frac spreads with 11 rigs and 3 to 4 frac spreads. So I think if you just keep watching our numbers that we print, I think that will be a good indicator of whether or not we're being efficient. And certainly, for the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter also, the numbers really look strong.\nNeal Dingmann: No, I agree. I agree. Okay. And then now that Guidon and QEP are in the books, I'm just wondering, could you or Kaes comment anything you all see that's different or surprised you from the assets? Maybe specifically, if you all still believe there's as many quality locations? And how do you sort of rank that inventory versus existing?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Certainly, that narrative hasn't changed at all. In fact, it's probably gotten a little bit better. And I'll tell you, I was very complementary of the QEP team at acquisition announcement time and again, during our February call and our April update. Operationally, they were doing some really efficient things. And just looking at the drilling report this morning, QEP's always use water-based mud. And Diamondback now, we've adopted it and we're on our first or second well with water-based drilling fluids that quite honestly, QEP is helping us with. And so far, really, really impressed with the improved efficiency using water-based mud. So that's been a nice add to what I thought was already a really efficient Diamondback legacy operations team. This looks to be a little bit of a stairstep in the right direction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Travis, I guess the shoe is on the other foot this time with Diamondback on the other side of marketing assets. I wanted to get your thoughts. Obviously, you guys have the data room for the Bakken sale. You sold some noncore Permian assets as well. What is your sense of the A&D market today? We've seen a couple of very large Permian trades, DoublePoint and Vitol. And I guess I wanted to get your sense of, do you see more of these private-to-public trades occurring this year? And what criteria that Diamondback will use to evaluate A&D activity?\nTravis Stice: Certainly, we were really pleased with the interest in the Bakken divestiture process. Now granted, we were the beneficiaries of commodity price run-up and some previously announced deals in the Bakken that I think put some wind at our backs. So that -- I think that piece of the A&D still seems to be pretty frothy, particularly on the PDP-focused type of divestitures, a lot of interest in that. But specific to what Diamondback is looking for on a go-forward basis, we still remain very resolute in our strategy that it's got to meet internal objectives like free cash flow, and it's got to be return accretive on a per share basis. And when you look at the combination, we've got to accelerate return of free cash flow. The larger trades that -- particularly the ones that you referenced, it's -- the quality of assets that fit for capital in Diamondback's top quartile are probably fewer than greater. And the prices that were recently announced on some of those trades might have coiled some of the activity for a little while anyway. But I think as long as we can demonstrate that were being accretive on a per share basis and that we're accelerating return of free cash flow, we're going to continue to look in the Permian Basin. But the opportunity set is pretty narrow right now.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: But most importantly, there has to be inventory that competes for capital right away, right? We -- while this industry has moved towards financial metrics, that can't be the only numbers that we look at when we think about what makes sense in terms of an acquisition and sticking inventory in the bottom quartile or bottom half of our existing inventory just doesn't make sense to us from a returns perspective.\nArun Jayaram: Makes sense. Kaes, I'd love to get your thoughts on the updated inventory disclosure, quite a few changes here. It looks like in terms of -- focusing on the Midland Basin, you increased your inventory count by just over 150 net locations. I know that the lateral lengths increased a little bit and perhaps, the Delaware declines just reflect some of the A&D activity. But give us some thoughts on the updated inventory kind of snapshots, kind of the key takeaways. And I do sense that you perhaps are using a little bit wider spacing for some of the acquired assets from QEP and Guidon?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. That's right. We hadn't posted a full inventory update since the beginning of 2020. So this was the first update post the 2 deals. I'd say, generally, we spend a lot of time looking at our development as well as offset development, particularly in the Midland Basin. And I mean, I think our focus is the best zones can still handle kind of 660-foot spacing, which is as tight as we've kind of ever gotten. But we kind of realized that maybe the secondary zone should be spaced a bit wider. And so that's reflected in that inventory numbers we've put out. So secondary zones that are getting codeveloped with the primary zone, which we still think is the right thing to do, are getting spaced at 5 to 7 wells a section rather than kind of 7 to 8, which is the best zones.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Taking a look at the slides here, you show at a $60 WTI price in reference to this driver in your script of north of $1.4 billion of free cash flow before the dividend this year. But this year, you are burdened by hedges. I was curious if you could provide some perspective around what open EBITDA would look like in that type of environment. And then also your perspective on use of proceeds of all this free cash flow and the asset sales, your framework around returning some of this excess capital to shareholders.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. That's a good question, Neil. We're probably sitting on about $450 million or $500 million of hedge losses for the rest of the year at strip today for the balance sheet. So that's the drag on free cash this year. I think it's fortunate that we are losing money on hedges compared to where we were a year ago, but unfortunate that we do have to write the checks. But overall, I think if you add that number back to the free cash number, you can get a pretty clean look at what the future might hold on an unhedged basis.\nNeil Mehta: That's great. And that ties into the follow-up around capital returns. Talk about how quickly you can get to the leverage levels that you're targeting. And then there are a lot of different options at that point, right? You could think about a buyback, you can think about a variable dividend. Recognizing it's too early to commit to that until you hit your debt target, just walk us through your framework about the different options that are at your disposal.\nTravis Stice: Yes. Sure, Neil. I think it's good for our industry that we continue to talk about investors recouping a return for the money that they've asked us to deploy. I think that's good for our industry. And you're right about reaching certain debt targets and these announcements that we laid out yesterday to simply accelerate the time frame at which we can hit those debt targets. I think the callable debt reduction of $1.2 billion or more by the end of this year is going to put us in a favorable position to start talking about what the next step is. I also think that our industry has seen a lot of interest in laying out a formula for how capital allocation is going to go or capital allocation and returns to shareholders is going to go. And I wish that our industry was as simple that you could put a formula in place, and formulas work as long as the world doesn't change. But in our business and a commodity-based business, we know that our world does change. So I'm always a little leery of trying to promise delivery on a formula when we know the world is going to change. But the options are very clear. The strategy around the variable dividend is part of the future discussions at the Board level, as is share buybacks, and most importantly, like we've always committed to, continue to lean into our base dividend. So we're very pleased that we're able to accelerate our debt reduction targets with kind of a very positive divestiture number. And we're going to continue to deliver on -- through our performance and try to avoid making promises multiple quarters in front of us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: Travis, after the QEP deal, you suggested that your breakeven to sustain your production would potentially move lower. Just wonder if you could give an update in light of your comments around synergies last night as to where you see that settling out.\nTravis Stice: Well, certainly, the synergies that were in excess of what we promised stem from the refinancing of the locked QEP's debt. I think we talked $40 million. We didn't even describe that as a synergy at acquisition announcement time. The specifics around lowering the breakeven cost has to do with our capital allocation of moving rigs into this newly acquired acreage, both Guidon and QEP. And while I can't formulaically give you dollars and cents how much our breakeven cost has come down, we do know that doing higher cash flow-generating projects at higher rate of return is going to translate to a lower breakeven cost.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. It seems to us you've won by about $1 or $2, but we'll take that off-line. My follow-up is also related to I guess some of the comments at the time of the QEP deal related to infrastructure and maybe the opportunity to drop or look at dropping down some assets to Rattler and maybe some royalty opportunities for Viper. I'm just wondering if you got any update you can share as to how you're thinking about that.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Doug, there's not a lot on the Viper side to drop down at the Diamondback today. QEP and Guidon, they, in different ways -- QEP is on a lot of large landowners in the Permian that have been around for a long time and not looking to sell their minerals, and Guidon had a sister company like a Viper that was buying minerals. So on the Viper side, we're certainly sourcing minerals at the Viper level under QEP and Guidon acreage, but there won't be a drop down. And then on the Rattler side, QEP, we've been pretty vocal that QEP did a really good job on infrastructure. I think we've learned a lot on the recycling side from them, who's going to boost our Midland Basin recycling program significantly. And eventually, those assets should probably be long in Rattler, but I think it's going to take a few more quarters for us to get that -- all that worked on and then eventually, drop it down.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens.\nGail Nicholson: Every quarter, efficiency gains are achieved. Where do you think you are in that learning curve? And are you trying any new technologies that could prove to be beneficial for future improvements?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Gail, I mean, I think Travis kind of said it earlier in the call, but bringing the QEP team in the fold, just like when we brought Energen in the fold, we don't need to be the best, we just want to learn from the people that we add to the team. And we learned a lot from Energen, and then we recently just learned a lot from QEP. So as Travis was mentioning, water-based mud on the drilling side, some drill-out techniques on larger pads that are saving us some time. On the cementing side, I think we've learned that we can batch drill and batch cement, which saves us time, and this all reduces time on location and increases the efficiencies, which is why Danny's team on the drilling side is getting kind of ahead of the 2021 program early in the year, which I think is positive.\nTravis Stice: Gail, back at the Energen announcement time, I think I used the phrase that we checked our egos at the door when we brought the Energen team on board. And this is just really -- as Kaes highlighted, this is another example of checking your egos at the door, and let's just try to figure out what's the best way to do this for our shareholders. And really proud of the operations organization. Once again, they've done so. And we've not really had the QEP team inside the fold for very long, but that they're already making a very positive influence.\nGail Nicholson: And then circling back to the inventory. With the improvement in oil prices, Do the secondary zone see a potential uptick in capital allocation in '22 forward? Or should we still be assuming that the primary zones are the target for the foreseeable future?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: I think just generally, we're very focused on co-development between zones, particularly in the Midland Basin, and the secondary zones get spaced a little wider. I think, Gail, we did a lot of work at various oil prices on inventory and spacing and EUR per foot. And we kind of found that the benefit to IRR outweighs any benefit to NPV from going tighter. So no one got mad at you for drilling wells that were too good. And so I think we're going to stick with that strategy, particularly with how much undeveloped acreage we got with the QEP and Guidon deals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Just curious, the deal with QEP only closed, I guess, about 7 weeks ago now. As we think about your development plans on those assets, when would be like a decision point where we might see a shift of activity either more towards county line or some other areas that you're learning from that might have surprised you with what you're seeing today versus pre-deal so we could start thinking about how '22 looks?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. David, I think you start to see that in terms of the wells that we're going to be drilling now, but you won't see it in terms of production until kind of Q4 '21, early '22. I think we're trying to get as many rigs as we can in the Robertson Ranch/Sale Ranch area in South Central, Martin County, some big pads and efficient development going to be headed that direction. Rigs are there right now. I think when it comes to kind of county line in the northern part of Martin County, we've done a lot of technical review with the QEP team and our team, and they've done some things in the shallower zones that we like, some targets that we like in the county line area. So I think you'll see more of the Wolfcamp A, Middle Spraberry, Dean, LS work in the county line area and then more of the deeper Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry in the Robertson Ranch area.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And if I could just ask one on just the capital program this year. Just curious, like relative to your guidance on footage cost of $520 to $580 in the Midland and $720 to $800 in the Del, where you guys are today? Because as I look at the rest of the year, it seems to certainly be implying like a back half-weighted program. Does that stairstep up each quarter now going into the end of the year? Because I guess we're thinking about sort of like the sustaining quarterly run rate that we should expect going into next year.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. That's a good question as well. I think I'll take the well costs first. We put a lot of look at well costs in the deck. Midland Basin was around $530 a foot, and Delaware was actually below the low end of the guide, which I think was just a really good quarter operationally, a little lower sample size as well. But as you think, we did put out Q1 CapEx of $300 million in Q2, implying $375 million at the midpoint. So that would imply we're going to spend $1 billion in the back half of the year. And I would say there's certainly some conservatism on our side. We've been very vocal that we will cut CapEx to keep production flat rather than grow production and spend more dollars. But the ancillary stuff, environmental, infrastructure, midstream, non-op is going to pick up a bit in the middle of the second half of the year, and that, on top of the couple of quarters of true pro forma QEP and Guidon and Diamondback activity, will result in capital coming up slightly throughout the year. But yes, we're off to a pretty good start in the first half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: Congrats on your transactions. Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, following up on the earlier A&D question, but taking it a slightly different direction. In your view, did that larger transaction tilt the environment to a seller's market? And if so, would it make sense to pursue smaller divestitures to further improve your balance sheet?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: That's a good question. Certainly, the market has improved dramatically, and that's why we kicked off that -- the Upton County process and the non-op New Mexico process that, we thought in the back of our minds, were sale candidates for years, but the last 12 months have not been conducive to selling cash flow. I think the trend, Derrick, is that a lot of private capital has moved towards buying PDP-heavy assets and distributing that cash flow to their LPs or to their shareholders. And when everyone's doing that, you have a lot of competitive tension in the process. And so that allowed us to get pretty competitive bids on all 3 assets, and we're pretty happy. But I think for us, anything else that's a sale candidate in the Permian has real undeveloped value, and that's not something we're looking to sell right now because I think the market for that is less competitive than a PDP-heavy market.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes sense. And Travis, for my follow-up, I'd like to pick up on a comment from my discussion yesterday. As you guys progress your plans to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset Scope 1 emissions, could you speak to the nature of your industry discussion since Q4 and how that plan might take shape longer term at Diamondback?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Specifically, for Diamondback, we talked about CCUS technology and emerging trends with that. I think a good analogy for our Diamondback shareholders would be to see how Rattler participated alongside subject matter experts on long-haul pipe. We don't expect to become subject matter experts in income-generating projects, CCUS type projects. But we do anticipate aligning ourselves with those that are -- those experts and try to do those technologies. That is -- those emerging technologies are not months or -- they're quarters away. And there are things that -- there's new technology emerging, and we're trying to stay abreast of it. And when I talk to my industry peers, it's a very similar tact that they're taking as well, too, is to try to be extremely fast followers and figure out what emerging technology needs you need to lean into the soonest. But I think it's an industry trend for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors.\nDavid Heikkinen: Any thoughts on a drop-down of your QEP Midstream assets or formerly QEP assets into Rattler and timing of that?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. David, it's certainly on the schedule. The other activity is getting Bakken sold and getting the refinancing done took priority, but the team is doing their work. I think as you think about the drop-down, we're going to have a very large block across half of Martin County, and so we want to get the engineering right and also build out recycling infrastructure across that block to be able to store, produce water and reuse it in the Midland Basin. So I think it's a couple of quarters away, but certainly, it's on the docket.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments around synergies. You guys talked about that you're ahead of expectations of the $60 million to $80 million. Clearly, you pointed out the debt refinance split. Perhaps maybe you could talk a little bit more to kind of the G&A and the operational synergies. Are we going to start to see those numbers show up as soon as second quarter earnings when you report? Do these come more in the second half of the year? And can you maybe provide a little bit of color just on the operational synergies and specifically, where those will come from?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Leo, I think we predicated the deal primarily on G&A and interest. QEP was a low-cost operator just like Diamondback. So unlike Energen, we didn't come out and say, \"Hey, we're going to drill 2,000 wells $200 a foot cheaper.\" But the G&A stuff will start to show in Q3 and Q4. And obviously, the interest has happened today. I think there's probably some upside on the operational front when -- if and when a drop-down happens at Rattler, and being able to connect all of our midstream systems without spending extra capital to add that capacity could be an upside surprise.\nTravis Stice: And also, Leo, just operational, what we talked already on this call about the water-based mud, using big rigs for drill-out, some of the other cementing practices that Diamondback is now adopting from QEP learnings, those all translate directly to lower dollars per foot, and that's -- those are direct synergies as well.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just on the LOE side, you guys certainly spoke to just great cost control in the first quarter. Certainly couldn't help but to notice that your first quarter LOE was below your full year guidance despite the fact that we had a, call it, 100-year storm in the first quarter. So certainly, you guys -- looks like you guys are doing a good job executing in the field. Do you guys feel like you're maybe set up to come in a little bit below that LOE guidance for the year? Or are you going to see an uptick once the QEP and Guidon assets kind of take full effect here in the second quarter?\nDaniel Wesson: Leo, it's Danny. The LOE in the first quarter, we certainly saw some surprising benefits throughout the year during first quarter from some electrical contracts and other things throughout the storm. We do expect that we'll see a little bit of increase from that number from the Guidon and QEP assets. Mostly the Guidon assets have a little bit higher lifting cost than what we've traditionally seen at Diamondback. But we like the low end of that guide right now. And as we learn kind of more about the assets and where their lifting cost is going to settle as we get them integrated, we'll update the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities.\nRichard Tullis: Just one question for me, kind of following up on the earlier ESG discussion. And you mentioned, Travis, in your opening comments about being the fast follower in the investment side. So you generated strong free cash flow, and it certainly looks like that continue given where commodity prices are. How large of a part of the FANG story could investment in renewables or CCUS type projects or entities develop into, say, over the next 2, 3 years?\nTravis Stice: Yes. That's a fair question, Richard. But I just -- I don't know what that number is going to look like yet. There's too much that's still emerging in the form of new technology development. And I know it's important, but in terms of what percentage of our capital is going to be allocated towards that, I'm not comfortable communicating that yet because it's -- quite honestly, we don't know what that answer is.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I mean I think what's most important, Richard, is if our Scope 1 emissions go down, you have less incentive or need to invest on the other side to offset it, right? So today, $15 million a year is going into the tank battery side. And I think we put out some new numbers that we're going to replace 200 generators in the field this year and move that to line power. We're then moving towards a Scope 2 emissions number and how we're going to get that down through sourcing electricity through renewable sources. So while Travis says we're going to be a fast follower on the investment side, we're certainly going to be a leader in terms of spending dollars in the field to clean up and reduce our intensity on what we can control.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.\nCharles Meade: A quick one for me and then maybe a more open-ended one. You guys -- you've sold or agreed to sell close to $1 billion worth of assets, but your CapEx guidance is unchanged. So does that mean that you essentially had de minimis CapEx on those assets that you're divesting? Or is there some reallocation going on?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: No. It just means they were noncore, Charles. The key to an asset sale is does that asset compete for capital with the rest of your assets, and these 3 assets did not. I'd say some of the New Mexico acreage was really good acreage. But we're not a non-op producer. So we sold stuff that sits lower in the inventory ranking, and we're going to reinvest it at this time to pay down debt and generate free cash to return to shareholders.\nCharles Meade: Got it. And then Travis, if I could go back to comments in your prepared remarks. You've mentioned before how oil inventories, global oil inventories and also U.S. inventories are looking in -- looking better, but we're still looking at some supply artificially being withheld from the market by OPEC+. I want to understand a little bit more of your thinking because in my way of looking at things, if you wait until OPEC+ has 0 barrels off-line, at that point, we're probably in a spike scenario. And I don't think you maybe need to wait that long. And so maybe it's not a binary thing that you have to wait until OPEC spare supply is 0. But can you tell me about how it looks from your point of view? And what any threshold or series of thresholds would be?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Certainly, I wish most of the decisions that I had to answer were binary, yes or no type of questions, and this is not one of those. Just from a macro perspective, you know that OPEC+ is effectively controlling the market right now, and it's having an outcome of reduced inventories. And against the backdrop of still a fledgling oil demand recovery, which quite honestly, might be negatively impacted by the unfortunate outbreak in India, it's just still -- in our opinion, it's still too early to be talking about growth. There's no clear signal. Now do we need to get to 0? With OPEC+ being retailed, I don't know that, that's the right answer either. We still got to assimilate 1 million or 1.5 million barrels a day of our and production likely coming back on. So it's an evolving question. But as it pertains to Diamondback, there's no clear signal for us to grow volumes, and it's unlikely that you've seen any of those signals this year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Travis, just curious that you talked about the near-term debt reduction for this year, $1.2 billion. Longer term, what will be the right capital structure or the debt level for Diamondback?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I think that's certainly an evolving question as well but -- or a revolving answer as well. But certainly, we wanted to get our absolute debt reduced to where we were before the QEP and the Guidon acquisitions, which were almost there. I think in terms of leverage target, of course, leverage is a function of EBITDA, a function of oil price. But leverage targets, the Board mandate has had us below 2x since the IPO, and we'll be there now sooner rather than later. I think the longer-term run rate for leverage is probably 1 or below, and it's going to take multiple quarters for us to get there, but certainly encouraged with the way our forward outlook plan looks and our debt retirement strategy.\nPaul Cheng: Just curious of that because I think that's one school of thought in a highly volatile sector like oil and gas. The best hedge is actually not for the paper market hedging program, but using a fortress-like balance sheet. So on that basis that -- will Diamondback be interested or consider to drive the net debt down to a really low level so that you can get away from the hedging program totally and also position yourself to be much stronger and have far more flexibility and opportunity when you get to the next downturn?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Paul, I mean, I don't know if that's an either/or answer, right? I think it's an and answer. And like Travis was saying, I think something like a turn of permanent leverage at high 40s WTI is a pretty good hedge, natural hedge for the next downturn, but I think you also need some sort of put protection or big insurance policy that if things go really south like they did in 2020, you're still protected. So I think it's a combination. I think hedges will still be a part of our story, particularly with a growing dividend and investors demanding capital be returned to them. You have to protect that cash flow. The only way you can in the paper market, you might do a wire collar or buy puts that are pretty cheap. But I think, again, it's kind of an and discussion.\nPaul Cheng: And with your structure in Rattler, with more than 7% dividend yield there, so strategically, does it really have the benefit for you to keep it as an independent entity and drop down assets there? I mean does it really gain anything from a capital efficiency standpoint?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Well, we sold everything we had in that business for 29% of the business. So I think for Diamondback shareholders, the IPO of Rattler was certainly a win. I think we have to look at the subsidiaries consistently in the lens of what's the best thing for Diamondback shareholders and what's the best thing for the shareholders of the subsidiaries. Fortunately, we've created these vehicles without major conflicts of interest. And traditionally, they traded at higher multiples than the parent. So they've been, I'd say, successful investments. But yes, we got to think about what those -- what value those add. I think in an acquisitive environment, they've added value. And I guess, if we're acquiring less, we'll have to reassess that. But right now, they're still strategic, and we have a lot of value for Diamondback shareholders sitting in the stock of those two companies.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. All right. Final question for me. Can you discuss the process when you sell the Bakken asset? Maybe we are wrong, but when we're looking at the future strip, that for the next 12 months, the Bakken asset that you sold should be able to generate EBITDA of about $250 million to $300 million. So it looked like you sell for 2.5 to 3x turn. That seems a bit low. So just trying to understand the process.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: I think the process was very competitive. This was an asset that wasn't going to be getting capital from us. So I think, Paul, we were very vocal that the Bakken was going to be held for sale. I'm personally very pleased with the price we received. It seems like in the fall, everyone was saying, \"Oh, you can't sell anything for better than PDP, PV-15.\" And like I said earlier in the call, I think this industry can't move towards only looking at financial metrics. NPV and NAV still matter. They probably play a lower role than they did in the past. But financial metrics alone isn't going to be the reason why we sell an asset we deem noncore when we did an acquisition a couple of months ago.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

The LOE in the first quarter, we certainly saw some surprising benefits throughout the year during first quarter from some electrical contracts and other things throughout the storm.

Mostly the Guidon assets have a little bit higher lifting cost than what we've traditionally seen at Diamondback. But we like the low end of that guide right now.

            "content": "But most importantly, there has to be inventory that competes for capital right away, right? We -- while this industry has moved towards financial metrics, that can't be the only numbers that we look at when we think about what makes sense in terms of an acquisition and sticking inventory in the bottom quartile or bottom half of our existing inventory just doesn't make sense to us from a returns perspective. Yes. That's right. We hadn't posted a full inventory update since the beginning of 2020. So this was the first update post the 2 deals. I'd say, generally, we spend a lot of time looking at our development as well as offset development, particularly in the Midland Basin. And I mean, I think our focus is the best zones can still handle kind of 660-foot spacing, which is as tight as we've kind of ever gotten. But we kind of realized that maybe the secondary zone should be spaced a bit wider. And so that's reflected in that inventory numbers we've put out. So secondary zones that are getting codeveloped with the primary zone, which we still think is the right thing to do, are getting spaced at 5 to 7 wells a section rather than kind of 7 to 8, which is the best zones. Yes. That's a good question, Neil. We're probably sitting on about $450 million or $500 million of hedge losses for the rest of the year at strip today for the balance sheet. So that's the drag on free cash this year. I think it's fortunate that we are losing money on hedges compared to where we were a year ago, but unfortunate that we do have to write the checks. But overall, I think if you add that number back to the free cash number, you can get a pretty clean look at what the future might hold on an unhedged basis. Yes. Doug, there's not a lot on the Viper side to drop down at the Diamondback today. QEP and Guidon, they, in different ways -- QEP is on a lot of large landowners in the Permian that have been around for a long time and not looking to sell their minerals, and Guidon had a sister company like a Viper that was buying minerals. So on the Viper side, we're certainly sourcing minerals at the Viper level under QEP and Guidon acreage, but there won't be a drop down. And then on the Rattler side, QEP, we've been pretty vocal that QEP did a really good job on infrastructure. I think we've learned a lot on the recycling side from them, who's going to boost our Midland Basin recycling program significantly. And eventually, those assets should probably be long in Rattler, but I think it's going to take a few more quarters for us to get that -- all that worked on and then eventually, drop it down. Yes. Gail, I mean, I think Travis kind of said it earlier in the call, but bringing the QEP team in the fold, just like when we brought Energen in the fold, we don't need to be the best, we just want to learn from the people that we add to the team. And we learned a lot from Energen, and then we recently just learned a lot from QEP. So as Travis was mentioning, water-based mud on the drilling side, some drill-out techniques on larger pads that are saving us some time. On the cementing side, I think we've learned that we can batch drill and batch cement, which saves us time, and this all reduces time on location and increases the efficiencies, which is why Danny's team on the drilling side is getting kind of ahead of the 2021 program early in the year, which I think is positive.

So no one got mad at you for drilling wells that were too good. And so I think we're going to stick with that strategy, particularly with how much undeveloped acreage we got with the QEP and Guidon deals. Yes. David, I think you start to see that in terms of the wells that we're going to be drilling now, but you won't see it in terms of production until kind of Q4 '21, early '22. I think we're trying to get as many rigs as we can in the Robertson Ranch/Sale Ranch area in South Central, Martin County, some big pads and efficient development going to be headed that direction. Rigs are there right now. I think when it comes to kind of county line in the northern part of Martin County, we've done a lot of technical review with the QEP team and our team, and they've done some things in the shallower zones that we like, some targets that we like in the county line area. So I think you'll see more of the Wolfcamp A, Middle Spraberry, Dean, LS work in the county line area and then more of the deeper Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry in the Robertson Ranch area. Yes. That's a good question as well. I think I'll take the well costs first. We put a lot of look at well costs in the deck. Midland Basin was around $530 a foot, and Delaware was actually below the low end of the guide, which I think was just a really good quarter operationally, a little lower sample size as well. But as you think, we did put out Q1 CapEx of $300 million in Q2, implying $375 million at the midpoint. So that would imply we're going to spend $1 billion in the back half of the year. And I would say there's certainly some conservatism on our side. We've been very vocal that we will cut CapEx to keep production flat rather than grow production and spend more dollars. But the ancillary stuff, environmental, infrastructure, midstream, non-op is going to pick up a bit in the middle of the second half of the year, and that, on top of the couple of quarters of true pro forma QEP and Guidon and Diamondback activity, will result in capital coming up slightly throughout the year. But yes, we're off to a pretty good start in the first half. That's a good question. Certainly, the market has improved dramatically, and that's why we kicked off that -- the Upton County process and the non-op New Mexico process that, we thought in the back of our minds, were sale candidates for years, but the last 12 months have not been conducive to selling cash flow. I think the trend, Derrick, is that a lot of private capital has moved towards buying PDP-heavy assets and distributing that cash flow to their LPs or to their shareholders. And when everyone's doing that, you have a lot of competitive tension in the process. And so that allowed us to get pretty competitive bids on all 3 assets, and we're pretty happy. But I think for us, anything else that's a sale candidate in the Permian has real undeveloped value, and that's not something we're looking to sell right now because I think the market for that is less competitive than a PDP-heavy market. Yes. David, it's certainly on the schedule. The other activity is getting Bakken sold and getting the refinancing done took priority, but the team is doing their work. I think as you think about the drop-down, we're going to have a very large block across half of Martin County, and so we want to get the engineering right and also build out recycling infrastructure across that block to be able to store, produce water and reuse it in the Midland Basin. So I think it's a couple of quarters away, but certainly, it's on the docket. Yes. Leo, I think we predicated the deal primarily on G&A and interest. QEP was a low-cost operator just like Diamondback. So unlike Energen, we didn't come out and say, \"Hey, we're going to drill 2,000 wells $200 a foot cheaper.\" But the G&A stuff will start to show in Q3 and Q4. And obviously, the interest has happened today. I think there's probably some upside on the operational front when -- if and when a drop-down happens at Rattler, and being able to connect all of our midstream systems without spending extra capital to add that capacity could be an upside surprise. Yes. I mean I think what's most important, Richard, is if our Scope 1 emissions go down, you have less incentive or need to invest on the other side to offset it, right? So today, $15 million a year is going into the tank battery side. And I think we put out some new numbers that we're going to replace 200 generators in the field this year and move that to line power. We're then moving towards a Scope 2 emissions number and how we're going to get that down through sourcing electricity through renewable sources. So while Travis says we're going to be a fast follower on the investment side, we're certainly going to be a leader in terms of spending dollars in the field to clean up and reduce our intensity on what we can control. No. It just means they were noncore, Charles. The key to an asset sale is does that asset compete for capital with the rest of your assets, and these 3 assets did not. I'd say some of the New Mexico acreage was really good acreage. But we're not a non-op producer. So we sold stuff that sits lower in the inventory ranking, and we're going to reinvest it at this time to pay down debt and generate free cash to return to shareholders. Yes. Paul, I mean, I don't know if that's an either/or answer, right? I think it's an and answer. And like Travis was saying, I think something like a turn of permanent leverage at high 40s WTI is a pretty good hedge, natural hedge for the next downturn, but I think you also need some sort of put protection or big insurance policy that if things go really south like they did in 2020, you're still protected. So I think it's a combination. I think hedges will still be a part of our story, particularly with a growing dividend and investors demanding capital be returned to them. You have to protect that cash flow. The only way you can in the paper market, you might do a wire collar or buy puts that are pretty cheap. But I think, again, it's kind of an and discussion. Well, we sold everything we had in that business for 29% of the business. So I think for Diamondback shareholders, the IPO of Rattler was certainly a win. I think we have to look at the subsidiaries consistently in the lens of what's the best thing for Diamondback shareholders and what's the best thing for the shareholders of the subsidiaries. Fortunately, we've created these vehicles without major conflicts of interest. And traditionally, they traded at higher multiples than the parent. So they've been, I'd say, successful investments. But yes, we got to think about what those -- what value those add. I think in an acquisitive environment, they've added value. And I guess, if we're acquiring less, we'll have to reassess that. But right now, they're still strategic, and we have a lot of value for Diamondback shareholders sitting in the stock of those two companies. I think the process was very competitive. This was an asset that wasn't going to be getting capital from us. So I think, Paul, we were very vocal that the Bakken was going to be held for sale. I'm personally very pleased with the price we received. It seems like in the fall, everyone was saying, \"Oh, you can't sell anything for better than PDP, PV-15.\" And like I said earlier in the call, I think this industry can't move towards only looking at financial metrics. NPV and NAV still matter. They probably play a lower role than they did in the past. But financial metrics alone isn't going to be the reason why we sell an asset we deem noncore when we did an acquisition a couple of months ago."

            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to effectively navigate a once-in-a-generation winter storm while keeping well costs and cash operating costs near all-time lows. We closed both the Guidon and QEP acquisitions in the first quarter and are very pleased with how the integration efforts are progressing. We are achieving our synergy targets ahead of schedule and in excess of the $60 million to $80 million of annual cost savings we highlighted when the deals were announced. Yesterday, we also announced 3 noncore asset divestitures for gross expected proceeds of $832 million. By selling these noncore acreage positions in such a timely and opportunistic manner, we were able to take advantage of a strong A&D market and generate attractive cash returns for Diamondback shareholders. We anticipate using the combined proceeds from these noncore asset sales to accelerate debt reduction. As we discussed last quarter, even though oil demand has shown signs of recovery from the depths of the global pandemic, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, primarily through the actions of OPEC+. As a result, we continue to believe we do not need production growth and will hold our pro forma fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat through 2021. Due to the complexity resulting from the timing of the QEP and Guidon acquisitions as well as the announced divestitures, we have instituted quarterly production and capital guidance for the first time. For the second quarter, we anticipate spending $350 million to $400 million in capital and producing 232,000 to 236,000 barrels of oil a day. This production range accounts for a full quarter of contribution from QEP's Williston asset and approximately 2 months of production from the announced noncore Permian asset sales. Looking at the full year of 2021, our free cash flow profile continues to improve. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $330 million of free cash flow, marking the third consecutive quarter of significant free cash generation. At current strip pricing and accounting for the Williston divestiture, we expect to generate approximately $1.4 billion in pre-dividend free cash flow this year at a reinvestment ratio of below 55%.  In March, we executed a successful tender offer and refinancing of all of QEP bonds and one of Diamondback's existing bonds. This refinancing equates to $40 million of annual interest expense savings and extended our average debt maturity by 3 years. Today, we have 3 debt maturities that are callable before the end of this year: $191 million due later this year, $650 million due in 2023 and $432 million due in 2025. We expect to use cash on hand from internally generated cash flow as well as proceeds from our asset sales to retire these 3 tranches of bonds, reducing our absolute debt load and further strengthening our balance sheet. Now turning to ESG. We recognize the importance of operating with the highest level of environmental responsibility and continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We flared 0.75% of our gross gas production in the first quarter, a decrease of over 85% from 2019. Flaring is the biggest driver of our CO2 emissions. And while we are happy with our progress on our legacy acreage, we still have significant work to do on our recently acquired positions as we move to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024. We've also committed to reducing our methane intensity by 70% over the same time frame. In the first quarter, we continued spending capital to retrofit our older tank batteries with air pneumatic devices as gas pneumatics account for 50% of our methane emissions. We also signed a contract to conduct quarterly flyovers of all of our tank batteries to more frequently check for equipment leaks, improving our maintenance practices. Our Net Zero Now initiative is also underway, which means every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have 0 net Scope 1 carbon emissions from January 1, 2021 forward. While we recognize we still had a carbon footprint, we have already purchased carbon credits to offset remaining emissions and ultimately plan to be a fast follower in investing in income-generating projects here in the United States that will more directly offset these remaining Scope 1 emissions. To finish, the first quarter was busy and productive. We generated substantial free cash flow, kept our capital and operating costs down, extended debt maturities, added Tier 1 inventory and divested noncore assets. All the while, our strategy remains the same: operate in a prudent and sustainable manner, spend maintenance capital to hold production flat and use future free cash flow to return cash to shareholders and reduce debt. With these comments complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Sure. I think if you look, Neal, just at our cash cost that we printed this quarter, you would say that there's not been any leakage or any cost pressure that were -- that has translated into execution slippage associated with the lower activity rate. I mean, Neal, if you look at rolling into 2020 before the global pandemic hit, we were running 23 drilling rigs and, I don't know, 8 or 9 frac spreads. That was a pretty quick pace. And I've actually been really pleased with -- as that pace was reduced, in some cases, dramatically last year. Even as we've entered into this year, we really seem to be at a pretty efficient frontier in both rig activity and frac spreads with 11 rigs and 3 to 4 frac spreads. So I think if you just keep watching our numbers that we print, I think that will be a good indicator of whether or not we're being efficient. And certainly, for the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter also, the numbers really look strong. Yes. Certainly, that narrative hasn't changed at all. In fact, it's probably gotten a little bit better. And I'll tell you, I was very complementary of the QEP team at acquisition announcement time and again, during our February call and our April update. Operationally, they were doing some really efficient things. And just looking at the drilling report this morning, QEP's always use water-based mud. And Diamondback now, we've adopted it and we're on our first or second well with water-based drilling fluids that quite honestly, QEP is helping us with. And so far, really, really impressed with the improved efficiency using water-based mud. So that's been a nice add to what I thought was already a really efficient Diamondback legacy operations team. This looks to be a little bit of a stairstep in the right direction. Certainly, we were really pleased with the interest in the Bakken divestiture process. Now granted, we were the beneficiaries of commodity price run-up and some previously announced deals in the Bakken that I think put some wind at our backs. So that -- I think that piece of the A&D still seems to be pretty frothy, particularly on the PDP-focused type of divestitures, a lot of interest in that. But specific to what Diamondback is looking for on a go-forward basis, we still remain very resolute in our strategy that it's got to meet internal objectives like free cash flow, and it's got to be return accretive on a per share basis. And when you look at the combination, we've got to accelerate return of free cash flow. The larger trades that -- particularly the ones that you referenced, it's -- the quality of assets that fit for capital in Diamondback's top quartile are probably fewer than greater. And the prices that were recently announced on some of those trades might have coiled some of the activity for a little while anyway. But I think as long as we can demonstrate that were being accretive on a per share basis and that we're accelerating return of free cash flow, we're going to continue to look in the Permian Basin. But the opportunity set is pretty narrow right now. Yes. Sure, Neil. I think it's good for our industry that we continue to talk about investors recouping a return for the money that they've asked us to deploy. I think that's good for our industry. And you're right about reaching certain debt targets and these announcements that we laid out yesterday to simply accelerate the time frame at which we can hit those debt targets. I think the callable debt reduction of $1.2 billion or more by the end of this year is going to put us in a favorable position to start talking about what the next step is. I also think that our industry has seen a lot of interest in laying out a formula for how capital allocation is going to go or capital allocation and returns to shareholders is going to go. And I wish that our industry was as simple that you could put a formula in place, and formulas work as long as the world doesn't change. But in our business and a commodity-based business, we know that our world does change. So I'm always a little leery of trying to promise delivery on a formula when we know the world is going to change. But the options are very clear. The strategy around the variable dividend is part of the future discussions at the Board level, as is share buybacks, and most importantly, like we've always committed to, continue to lean into our base dividend. So we're very pleased that we're able to accelerate our debt reduction targets with kind of a very positive divestiture number. And we're going to continue to deliver on -- through our performance and try to avoid making promises multiple quarters in front of us. Well, certainly, the synergies that were in excess of what we promised stem from the refinancing of the locked QEP's debt. I think we talked $40 million. We didn't even describe that as a synergy at acquisition announcement time. The specifics around lowering the breakeven cost has to do with our capital allocation of moving rigs into this newly acquired acreage, both Guidon and QEP. And while I can't formulaically give you dollars and cents how much our breakeven cost has come down, we do know that doing higher cash flow-generating projects at higher rate of return is going to translate to a lower breakeven cost. Gail, back at the Energen announcement time, I think I used the phrase that we checked our egos at the door when we brought the Energen team on board. And this is just really -- as Kaes highlighted, this is another example of checking your egos at the door, and let's just try to figure out what's the best way to do this for our shareholders. And really proud of the operations organization. Once again, they've done so. And we've not really had the QEP team inside the fold for very long, but that they're already making a very positive influence. Yes. Specifically, for Diamondback, we talked about CCUS technology and emerging trends with that. I think a good analogy for our Diamondback shareholders would be to see how Rattler participated alongside subject matter experts on long-haul pipe. We don't expect to become subject matter experts in income-generating projects, CCUS type projects. But we do anticipate aligning ourselves with those that are -- those experts and try to do those technologies. That is -- those emerging technologies are not months or -- they're quarters away. And there are things that -- there's new technology emerging, and we're trying to stay abreast of it. And when I talk to my industry peers, it's a very similar tact that they're taking as well, too, is to try to be extremely fast followers and figure out what emerging technology needs you need to lean into the soonest. But I think it's an industry trend for sure. And also, Leo, just operational, what we talked already on this call about the water-based mud, using big rigs for drill-out, some of the other cementing practices that Diamondback is now adopting from QEP learnings, those all translate directly to lower dollars per foot, and that's -- those are direct synergies as well. Yes. That's a fair question, Richard. But I just -- I don't know what that number is going to look like yet. There's too much that's still emerging in the form of new technology development. And I know it's important, but in terms of what percentage of our capital is going to be allocated towards that, I'm not comfortable communicating that yet because it's -- quite honestly, we don't know what that answer is. Yes. Certainly, I wish most of the decisions that I had to answer were binary, yes or no type of questions, and this is not one of those. Just from a macro perspective, you know that OPEC+ is effectively controlling the market right now, and it's having an outcome of reduced inventories. And against the backdrop of still a fledgling oil demand recovery, which quite honestly, might be negatively impacted by the unfortunate outbreak in India, it's just still -- in our opinion, it's still too early to be talking about growth. There's no clear signal. Now do we need to get to 0? With OPEC+ being retailed, I don't know that, that's the right answer either. We still got to assimilate 1 million or 1.5 million barrels a day of our and production likely coming back on. So it's an evolving question. But as it pertains to Diamondback, there's no clear signal for us to grow volumes, and it's unlikely that you've seen any of those signals this year. Yes. I think that's certainly an evolving question as well but -- or a revolving answer as well. But certainly, we wanted to get our absolute debt reduced to where we were before the QEP and the Guidon acquisitions, which were almost there. I think in terms of leverage target, of course, leverage is a function of EBITDA, a function of oil price. But leverage targets, the Board mandate has had us below 2x since the IPO, and we'll be there now sooner rather than later. I think the longer-term run rate for leverage is probably 1 or below, and it's going to take multiple quarters for us to get there, but certainly encouraged with the way our forward outlook plan looks and our debt retirement strategy. Thank you again, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Diamondback Energy Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Adam, go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2022 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. 2022 was another great year for Diamondback. We successfully executed on our capital program, accelerated our return of capital plan and generated record cash flow. I'm very proud of all that we were able to accomplish and look forward to what I believe will be another strong year for the company. Looking back at last year, we produced over 223,000 barrels of oil per day, exceeding our production expectations. This is primarily the result of our well performance, which continues to trend in the right direction as our normalized oil production in the Midland Basin improved by 6% year-over-year and nearly 20% when compared to 2020. We continue to optimize our multi-zone co-development strategy, which we pivoted to prior to the pandemic by tweaking our frac designs, spacing assumptions and landing zones to maximize our returns.  On the operations side, we've also built out substantial water infrastructure, which allows us to implement simul-frac completions across our position. This type of completion is consistently more efficient than a traditional zipper frac design because we can complete approximately 80 wells per year with just one crew. When you add in the additional efficiencies we're seeing from our Halliburton e-fleet, our completion savings are approximately $50 a foot. Last year was not without its challenges from significant inflationary pressures, particularly with casing, equipment availability and weather-related downtime. However, our operational team did what it always does, deliver best-in-class execution. Our ability to hold our capital budget flat and stay within our original guidance range while also exceeding our production target is something you should expect from Diamondback as we push to deliver differentiated results quarter after quarter. Financially, we generated over $7 billion in EBITDA and $4.6 billion in free cash flow or nearly $26 per share, both records for the company. We made significant progress on our return of capital plan, increasing our cash return commitment in the middle of the year to return at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders. In total, we returned 68% of our free cash flow in 2022, which equates to $3.1 billion through a combination of our base and variable dividend and share repurchase program, buying back nearly 8.7 million shares at an average price of $126 per share for a total of $1.1 billion. This represents 5% of our shares outstanding when we announced our program in September of 2021. An additional $2 billion was returned through our base and variable dividend with the total dividend growth of nearly 5x when compared to 2021. In total, we returned $11.31 per share in dividends.  In the fourth quarter alone, we returned over $860 million or $5.65 per share with a total dividend yield of nearly 9%. This included an increase to our annual base dividend of $0.20, now $3.20 per share annually or $0.80 per quarter, representing 54% year-over-year growth. We also announced multiple strategic transactions in the fourth quarter that better position us for the long term. We made two Midland Basin acquisitions, Lario and FireBird, both of which are now closed and seamlessly integrated that added over 500 high-quality opportunities and 83,000 net acres to our portfolio. This additional inventory, along with the associated production and cash flow, has solidified our size and scale in the Midland Basin, giving us a strategic advantage as we execute on our capital programs for the decades to come.  Last summer, we bought in all the outstanding units of Rattler, which gives us additional flexibility to think strategically about our existing midstream portfolio. We now have the ability to monetize assets that trade at a higher multiple than our upstream business and use the proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet or acquire additional upstream assets. The first example of this was the sale of our 10% interest in the Gray Oak crude oil pipeline to Enbridge. We achieved a 1.75 multiple on our invested capital and used the proceeds to partially fund the cash portion of the Lario acquisition.  As we evaluated both our Rattler operated assets and equity method investments, we've also monetized multiple noncore upstream positions. We have now divested nearly $600 million in upstream assets since the third quarter of last year, which includes two recent deals in Southeast Glasscock and Ward and Winkler counties. These assets simply did not compete for immediate capital within our portfolio. We have now increased our noncore asset target sales from $500 million to at least $1 billion by the end of this year. Last year, we improved our leverage ratio, now below 1x, and also pushed the tenor of nearly 90% of our debt past 5 years, with over $2 billion due in the 2050 at an average coupon of below 5%. We will continue to use free cash flow and proceeds from our noncore asset sales to lower our overall debt profile, continually improving our financial position. As we move into 2023, we expect to deliver relatively flat pro forma production year-over-year. When you account for the 11 months of Lario and a full year of FireBird production contribution, our guidance reflects 260,000 barrels of oil a day and $2.6 billion in CapEx, while running 15 rigs and 4 simul-frac crews. In closing, 2022 was an outstanding year for the company. We generated record free cash flow and distributed nearly 70% of it to our shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet, extended our inventory runway and continue to produce one of the highest margin barrels in the industry. Looking ahead, our business model is working, and we are confident in our 2023 outlook and our ongoing ability to continue generating peer-leading returns for our stockholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann : Thanks for all the details, Travis. My first question is just on shareholder return topic. More than -- it's now been maybe even two years ago, certainly, more than a year ago, you mentioned way back that you thought once the macro supply demand was more in balance, you'd consider potentially more growth. I'm just wondering, has the thinking changed based on what we know of continued investor shareholder return or other factors that continue to drive sort of the environment in today?\nTravis Stice : Yes, Neal, I don't think the macro conditions are dictating any kind of production growth currently. I mean you still have an uncertain Fed action. You've got uncertainty around China COVID, demand recovery. You've still got Russian barrels that are still finding their way into the market. So it doesn't appear to me that the macro conditions have fundamentally changed. And certainly, the feedback -- and perhaps, most importantly, the feedback we get from our shareholders are encouraging us to continue to embrace a shareholder return more.\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes. I think also on top of that, Neal, we're going to be growing oil production per share significantly in 2023 through two well-timed acquisitions and a significant amount of buybacks in 2022. So per share metrics continue to improve. We continue to invest in high-return projects while not having to change our activity plan on a monthly basis trying to follow the crude price. The plan is the plan, and this steady state of activity has produced good results to date and no need to change that while it's working right now.\nNeal Dingmann : Good point, Kaes. That might really leads to my follow-up just on capital efficiency. Specifically, when I look at -- by our calculation, you all pump out more free cash flow per barrel of oil than any E&P. And I'm just wondering, when you look at this driver, is that based -- is that driven largely on this co-development that you talked about? Is it capital efficiency? I'm just wondering, you all just most recently seem to be hitting all the right numbers. But I'm wondering when I look at this all important metric, what Travis or you, Kaes, would consider maybe some of the drivers of that.\nTravis Stice : Yes. It's certainly not just one thing, Neal. It's really a combination of all the things that we focus on really multiple times a day when it comes to executing our program. Certainly, well productivity enhancements add to that, but that's really an output of a very difficult decision we made in 2019 to pivot away from kind of the best two zone development strategy and embrace the multi-zone full section development strategy, which we're seeing benefits of today. You also hear us talk frequently about our cost structure and that cost structure is made up not only on the expense side where -- whether it's G&A or LOE, but also on the capital efficiency side where we continue to push the envelope, particularly on the variable cost side of things, simply doing more with less. And all of those things combined, I think, put us consistently towards the top of the most margin efficient producer in the basin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : The first question I had was around noncore asset sales and you did bump your target from $0.5 billion to $1 billion by year-end 2023. Can you give us a little bit more color around what are the natural strategic assets? And what the market looks like for asset sales right now?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, Neil, great question. I think we announced two E&P asset sales, noncore asset sales this quarter that I think fit the mold of what the market looks like right now. And that's assets that don't compete for capital in our capital plan for many, many years and a little bit of PDP associated with those assets. But generally, a buyer that is looking to develop those assets a lot faster than we're planning. And so these two deals, the buyers are going to get aggressive developing these two assets right away, which in the capital allocators, it's just good capital allocation from our perspective. Going into it, we expected to sell more midstream assets than E&P assets. So that's why we bumped the target, and we still have some strategic midstream investments that are nearing the point where they should be monetized. Gray Oak, I think, was a great example. We retained all of our commercial benefits of the transaction. We still move our barrels to the Gulf Coast. But just that from a financial perspective, the pipeline was a great investment and it worked, and we monetize it to the partners. So I'd expect more on the midstream side. We did highlight what we have from a midstream perspective in the deck for the first time, but we're going to be patient and prudent when it comes to selling assets.\nNeil Mehta : Yes, that's great perspective. And then the follow-up is the oil volume guide for the full year was solid. Q1 a little bit softer. So maybe you could just talk about the cadence of production over the course of the year and just how we should be thinking about the path for oil production in particular in 2023?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes. Good question as well. I think the plan when we acquired Firebird, Firebird was producing 17,000 barrels of oil a day. We guided to that asset producing 19,000 barrels of oil a day for the year 2023. So clearly, some growth on that asset we're already seeing, but we'll see the majority of that benefit going into Q2 to Q4. And then on top of that, obviously, closing the Lario acquisition on January 31, that immediately adds 6,000 net barrels a day -- or sorry, subtracts 6,000 net barrels a day from Q1 because we didn't get to count those volumes in January. So base case plan is to grow steadily from Q1 through Q4, and we got the projects to back that up.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Securities.\nArun Jayaram : Travis, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how the company has really optimized its multi-zone co-development strategy over the last couple two, three years. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail around kind of what you're doing today? I know, on Slide 16, you gave us a lot of great detail on the amount of net lateral footage by zone, but I wanted to understand what you're doing to maybe mitigate some of the issues we're seeing from the industry in terms of parent-child interference and impact some delayed targets. And just your thoughts on sustaining the level of well productivity gains that you generated last year into the future.\nTravis Stice : Yes. Good question, Arun. In 2018 and early 2019, we were really studying this co-development strategy intently, and the significant observation that we made from our analysis was that essentially, all of these zones talk to each other. And if they talk to each other, which means you actually have pressure communication during the fracking operations, which subsequently also means that you're kind of sharing the reserves as an individual well is produced that if you don't get them upon initial -- the initial development that when you go back in later, you'll find those zones have experienced some depletion and that depletion degrades the efficiency of your stimulated rock volume, which ultimately changes the production profile. And so in order to address that, we examined our spacing assumptions, both side to side and top to bottom, and made adjustments to try to minimize those frac pressure interferences. Spread some zones out further, spread some zones above and below further, but essentially went into a section -- half of section this time was our development strategy and completed all the wells at one time and then brought them all on at one time. And that was a painful decision because it's a lot easier. In fact, I've been -- I've said it before that I'll take criticism from drilling the very best zone, but we found out that, that actually wasn't the right development strategy, and we took some things for that in 2019. But as you can see, we put some details in our -- on Slide 16, as you alluded to. We're -- in the Midland Basin, our well results are equivalent to what we were seeing in 2017.  So very proud of the technical team and their diligence to try to crack a very difficult problem and then the courage to stay with that decision through periods when we were questioned about that development strategy. So I hope that answers your question, Arun.\nArun Jayaram : That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up. I wanted to get some thoughts on some of the initial well results from FireBird. I believe in that transaction, you guys underwrote just over 350 gross locations, but you highlighted some potential upside based on co-development opportunities. I was wondering thoughts on maybe some of the initial results in the Wolfcamp A, which I don't think was part of your original assessment of locations that you paid for.\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, great question, Arun. I think FireBird, at the end of the day, is the quintessential Diamondback deal, where we know the space and like the back of our hand and have been communicating with the FireBird team as they tested their position further West in the basin than others have in the past. And we follow the results closely and posted a couple of recent results that I think confirm a couple of things, but also give us some hope on upside in the central prospect. And there's a couple of wells sand the future may vary on the Far West side. This was probably the farthest West test to date and not an area we underwrote, and you have a very good Wolfcamp A result Far West. And then in the Southern portion of the position, you have this -- sorry, you have the four corners two-wells Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry. And we underwrote Lower Spraberry with Wolfcamp A upside across the central prospect, and it's looking more like you can have Lower Spraberry with Wolfcamp A co-development across that position.  So early days yet, but definitely a positive sign from the FireBird deal, and our technical team's work in getting that deal across the finish line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum : The first question is really just a follow-up on Arun's question. [indiscernible] you've seen a thematic of your peers testing additional zones this year. Maybe can you give us a sense of the 330 to 350 wells you're doing this year? [indiscernible] current inventory?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, David, you're breaking up a little bit there. So I'm going to try to repeat what I thought you said, which is, what other zones are we testing outside of our traditional development zones across the basin. Is that correct?\nDavid Deckelbaum : That's correct. Sorry about that.\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, no problem. So generally, right, the majority of our capital is going to be allocated to the best zones, co-development. A big development this year in kind of the sale of Robertson Ranches and the Central Martin County area. So that's where the majority of capital is getting deployed. Certainly, there are deeper tests going on throughout the basin. We have our Limelight Prospect, which covers that those deeper zones, a tariff structure on the eastern side of the Midland Basin, where we're going to be developing some Woodford and Barnett. Generally, we're probably going to drill 3 or 4 wells there this year. I don't think it's going to be 10, 15 plus, but I think generally, promising results from the deeper zones across the basin and the benefit of our position is that we hold a lot of those deeper zones, and we have a significantly large mineral company that owns mineral rights to the center of the earth forever in all those zones. So if those zones start getting leased up, it's a great benefit to the Diamondback-FireBird relationship.\nDavid Deckelbaum : And then [indiscernible] third year now of being in relatively a maintenance mode or low-growth mode, have you seen noticeable differences year-over-year in benefits from perhaps improved base declines? And how does decline [indiscernible] on '22 or '21?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, again, breaking up a little bit, but talking about base declines. I think the base business, obviously, the base decline continued to decrease since being a maintenance mode from 2020. We did add two acquisitions in FireBird and Lario, where they have built a lot of rate very quickly. And so those two deals have a higher decline rate than the base business, but I think we've managed that in our guidance and also manage that in how we're going to complete wells across the pro forma position. So certainly, base decline is coming down, but I really think the best benefit of this lower growth environment is that we can grow per share metrics while not having to change our development plan with every $10 move in oil price, right? The plan is the plan right now. Shale has certainly become longer cycle with these bigger pads. And so, we're not having to put a stress on the ops teams to move pads around if oil moves $5 or $10 a barrel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays.\nJeanine Wai : Our first question maybe just following up on David's question there on capital efficiency. Capital efficiency looked great in Q4, and you turned to sales about 55 net wells and you hit oil when your guidance, we think, implied like 73 net wells, so that's great. For 2023, the number of wells to sales looks a little bit higher than what we would have expected, if we just use the amount of wells you did in '22 and then we add in the Lario and the FireBird deal wells. So are we looking at that math correctly for 2023? And any color you would have would be helpful since including the divestitures, we still think the '23 outlook looks conservative, and we're assuming that the priority is really to beat on CapEx and not volumes.\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, Jeanine, I think a couple of things, right? Q4 was going to be a great quarter going into December. We had -- obviously, we all had a winter storm here. Diamondback did not announce the winter storm impact, but certainly, the winter storm did impact our production. So going into the last 10 days of the quarter, we felt very good about where we sat and still hit guidance. And therefore, from a POP perspective, we kind of moved some wells from Q4 into Q1 to get a head start on POPs. It's not a huge capital impact, but it is a number where we guide to first production. So there's a good amount of POPS in Q1 2023 because we were ahead of schedule in Q4 and feeling good about where we started Q1 this year.\nJeanine Wai : Okay. Great. And then maybe just going back to return of capital. Looking at just the buyback plus the variable amount for this quarter, the buyback was about 44% between the two of those. Is that rough split kind of indicative of what we should be expecting in the future? Or is it really just more opportunistic every quarter. We're just really just checking in if there's any change in how you're viewing the variable versus the buyback.\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes, no change, Jeanine. Really, the variable is the output of how many shares we didn't buy back in a particular quarter, and the buyback is still going to be very opportunistic. And I think now that we've kind of gone through this for four or five quarters, you can see that we step in and buy back when things are weaker. There's still been a lot of volatility in the space. We're going through a period of that volatility right now. And so you look back at a quarter like Q4, bought back less shares in October and November, but hit the buyback very hard in December. And I think you can expect us to keep doing that and then having the variable be the output of what base dividend plus buyback doesn't get through in a particular quarter.\nOperator: Derrick Whitfield from Stifel has our next question.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning, all. Congrats on a strong year-end.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nKaes Van't Hof : Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield : Building on an earlier question, I wanted to focus on your well productivity. Aside from the development sequencing impacts, are there one to two primary drivers that would explain the improvement you observed in all performance year-over-year?\nKaes Van't Hof : I think the biggest benefit, Derrick, is not only the assets we acquired from QEP and guide on, I think that deal while done at a tough time hit exactly what you're looking for in a transaction, right? We allocate more capital to those assets that we would have allocated to the business prior to the deals. So we're seeing a little benefit there. Those assets are also in areas where you have three or four or even five zone development, and so we're having massive pads come on in high-return areas with a little bit of a benefit on the Viper side with high mineral interest across that position. So space -- as Travis mentioned earlier in the call, taking a close look at spacing, learning from other operators in the basin, what to do and what not to do and implementing that very quickly into our plan is paying dividends.\nDerrick Whitfield : Perfect. And for my follow-up, I wanted to focus on your 2023 capital program. If we were to assume a flat commodity price environment, where are your greatest headwinds and tailwinds from a service cost perspective?\nKaes Van't Hof: The biggest headwind over the last six quarters has been casing costs. Now we can certainly see around the corner that maybe we're seeing some softening there. I'm not going to count on it until we see it, but casing has moved up from, let's call it, $40 or $50 a foot to $110 a foot. It's 20% of our Midland Basin well cost now, and that's a significant headwind over the last 6 quarters. I think the headwind is going to ease. If not, it's a little bit out of our control. But the things that we can control are the efficiencies gained from simul-frac operations. We'll probably have four simul-frac crews running by Q2 of this year, which is highly efficient, saves about $30 a foot versus conventional crews. And on top of that, two of those crews are going to be the Halliburton e-fleet Zeus crews, and those use less fuel, but also run on cheap Waha gas right now. So that saves another $15 or $20 a foot. So we're doing what we can to cut costs and keep costs as low as possible in an inflationary environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities.\nRoger Read : I'd just like to maybe dive into the gas takeaway question and how you're -- I understand how you're positioned not to have Waha basis risk for the most part, but what are you looking at in terms of flow assurance this year and to the extent you can say next year?\nKaes Van't Hof : Good question, Roger. I don't think flow assurance is going to be an issue for us, but we are exposed to the Waha price based on how the contracts are written. Through the history of Diamondback, we've been very acquisitive, and when we acquire things, it comes with contracts. And so, all those contracts are with private equity backed or some of the public gatherers and processors in the basin. So I feel really good about our flow assurance and our contracts, the issue is going to be price. And what we've seen in the basin is some tightness coming out of the basin on Waha when pipelines have gone up or gone down over the last six months. But really, there's a lot of processing capacity that's now coming on in the early part of 2023, particularly with two of our Midland Basin gatherers and processors. And I think that generally is going to move the issue further downstream. So it's going to be a tight gas market in the Permian. Henry Hub prices obviously aren't helping as well, but we feel good that the gas will move, and we're well hedged financially to protect from that downside. \nRoger Read : Appreciate that. And the other question I wanted to follow up on -- I am just looking for the right page, yes, Page 23 on the hedge summary. Any thoughts on -- if we look at where Q1 has hedged, Q2 really kind of similar, is that what you'd want to do ultimately for the back half of the year as we draw in closer and it becomes more financially reasonable to do that? Or are you, at this point, more comfortable going a little less hedged just given the overall structure of the balance sheet, presumably with these dispositions coming, a little more cash coming in?\nKaes Van't Hof: Great question, Roger. We don't believe in no hedges, I think, primarily because our balance sheet is a hedge. Our cost structures are hedged, but we consider our base dividend debt, right? And our base dividend is now $3.20 a share. It's almost $550 million of outflows a year. We think it's well protected today at $40 a barrel but we don\u2019t want to put that in harm's way. So we buy puts as fire insurance, and we basically use the front quarter to extend duration three or four quarters out. We try to be 50% to 60% hedged going into a particular quarter on oil down to 0% hedge four, five quarters out. So I think you can continue to expect us to do that, and your observations are 100% correct that in the back half of the year, it will grow as we go through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Jeoffrey Lambujon] from [Perella Weinberg Partners.]\nUnidentified Analyst: Just a couple for me, follow-ups on the service cost environment and Diamondback read-through specifically. I guess, first, I appreciate the comments on what you're watching for and how Diamondback is positioned to really maximize what you all can control. But I wonder if you could speak a little more broadly to what you're expecting in terms of year-over-year changes on inflation. I think the materials speak to 15% as the base case and really more so how that compares to what you're seeing on a leading-edge basis? And then I guess last one is, how we should think about the balance of the CapEx guide for this year in that context? And then the second part of my question is, just looking for a snapshot of well cost today on a per foot basis are tracking relative to the full year guide range and also relative to the mid-November snapshot that we got in last quarter's earnings?\nKaes Van't Hof : Good question, Jeoff. I think, generally, we guided to this year being around 15% year-over-year well costs, sub-10% from what we highlighted in November. And I would say, generally, those numbers still fit today. I would say, we're probably in the upper half of our well cost guidance for both Midland and Delaware today. But generally, there are some things coming our way outside of service cost deflation and that's another Halliburton Zeus e-fleet moving to four simul-fracs versus last year, we ran three in a spot crew. So that last simul-frac adds some efficiency. And I kind of put the budget two ways this year. I think if we see deflation, we're going to be closer to the lower half of our guide. And if we stay flat, we'll be to midpoint to the higher end. But I think generally, the anecdotes are coming in that some things are heading our way from a service cost perspective. And unlike last year, not everything -- not every line item will go up in the AFE.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup.\nScott Gruber : I want to circle back on the completion efficiency comments. E-frac obviously brings a pretty good fuel savings given the gas diesel spread here and obviously, associated ESG benefits. But do you think e-frac additions will be additive to the improvement in cycle times above and beyond what you're seeing from simul-frac?\nKaes Van't Hof : I think, generally, Scott, they complete a similar amount of lateral feet as the simul-frac crews as we're seeing early time. But on top of that, e-fleets on a fuel efficiency basis, not just the type of fuel, but the efficiency of the fuel used has been a positive surprise. I think the last thing I would add is that it does operate on a much smaller footprint. So maybe your moves are smaller, but you do have some electrical infrastructure associated with those fleets. Dan, do you want to add anything on that?\nDanny Wesson : Yes. I think we've only been running the first crew for about six months, and we've been really impressed with the performance thus far. It's outperformed our other fleets kind of on the margin, but not too measurable. We do believe that over time, you'll see that gap widen in performance, just really believe that the maintenance required around the e-fleet equipment will be substantially less. So we're excited to learn through that with Halliburton and recognize some added efficiencies on top of just fuel savings as we go forward.\nScott Gruber : And if service costs do start to slip in the Permian with Haynesville rigs and frac crews coming out migrating over, how quickly do you think that will hit your D&C costs? If that starts to kind of pivot here in the near future, is there an ability for you to realize that in the second half? Or we really talk about the 2024 benefit just given your contracts kind of in place at this juncture?\nDanny Wesson : Yes. I mean we don't really have any long-term contracts in place. We kind of have shorter cycle pricing agreements I think generally, we're exposed to market pricing across the board, and we certainly have some protections in place on some of our consumables, but if we start seeing the market soften, which we feel like is a pretty good likelihood with where we see gas prices today, that should trickle down into the oil basins, particularly on the drilling services side of things first. And we've certainly not seen a lot of upward pressure on pricing in the first part of this year. It's been pretty quiet, and hopefully, we'll start seeing some help on the inflation front here through the second and third quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy from Pickering Energy Partners.\nKevin MacCurdy: Congratulations on the great free cash flow quarter. It looks like cash taxes came in well under expectations and the guidance for 2023 cash taxes was below our model. I wonder if you can talk about what is driving the cash taxes lower, and any benefits you may be receiving from acquisitions?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question, Kevin. The biggest benefit we did receive in the fourth quarter, obviously, commodity prices came down quarter-over-quarter, Q3 to Q4. So that was a surprise for the positive on cash taxes. I guess that hurts you overall. But the biggest deferral we got was when we closed the FireBird deal came with about $100 million of midstream assets and some other fixed assets that we're able to depreciate right away, and so that allowed us to defer more taxes into 2023. As we've modeled 2023, we still have about $1 billion of NOL that will be exhausted this year. But on top of that, also closing the FireBird or the Lario transaction, which added some midstream and fixed assets as well. So generally, this is kind of our last year before being a full cash taxpayer. About two well timed deals allowed us to push out a little more cash. Obviously, it's not the reason why we do the deals, but it's a nice tangential benefit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Leo Mariani from ROTH MKM.\nLeo Mariani : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about LOE trends. Just looking at the guide here. In '23, you guys are expecting LOE to come up a little bit kind of versus where it was in '22? Maybe just a little color around what you're sort of seeing there.\nTravis Stice : Yes. I think you've got just a couple things that are impacting LOE. First, we're fairly exposed to the power market, and we rode through the back half of last year fairly unhedged through the -- we're up in gas prices and that really impacted our real-time power pricing, and you've seen kind of real-time power pricing kind of stay a little elevated through the first part of 2023 here. And so trying to guess where we're going to land with respect to power and have an opportunity to get hedged to protect ourselves, but -- so that's adding about a dime. And then you've got another impact from the FireBird acquisition with about 900 vertical wells, which had another dime or two to our consolidated LOE. So between those two things, you're looking at about a quarter, and we think we're probably running in the lower end of the guide today. And if we see some things come our way, we think we could potentially be under the guide, but we're not baking that into our guidance.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on M&A, obviously, you guys were helpful in terms of talking about some of these noncore asset sales, but I think you did mention in your prepared comments that perhaps, some of those proceeds could go to bolt-ons out there in the space. I was hoping you guys could just give us a little color in terms of what you're seeing? Are there bolt-ons available that are kind of in and around your asset base? And how would you kind of characterize the market now? Do you think that generally speaking, expectations from sellers are reasonable these days? Just trying to get a sense of whether or not there's a decent chance you might pick something up here in '23?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes. I don't know if sellers are ever reasonable, Leo. But generally, I do think the two larger transactions did happen because Diamondback's cost structure was differential in the second half of the year and going into 2023, right? We're drilling wells $2 million, $3 million, $4 million cheaper in the Midland Basin than peers, and that is when you underwrite PUDs, that drives value to the good guys even if you're not running strip oil pricing. So I think generally, that's what's happened. There's less and less large opportunities like the two that we announced last fall. So it's relatively quiet at the moment. But some of the smaller things that tend to trend with the large deals like the blocking and tackling, a couple of other deals that Firebird and Lario we're working on when they sold. That's the kind of stuff that we're focused on right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : In your presentation, you show a number of the energy ownership that in the pipeline and gas processing. Just curious that if any of those that you will consider strategically important for you to own their equity ownership? Or that -- I mean just trying to see that I mean, whether any of them have that strategic importance to you? Second question is that when we're looking at your inventory backlog, for those you consider over 10,000 feet, lateral length, you roughly say, call it, 5,500. Just want to see if we can drill a little bit more into that, and what percentage of those wells you can actually do maybe 3-miles? And whether there's an opportunity for trade and swap that you think you may be able to improve on that?\nKaes Van't Hof : Great. Thank you, Paul. I'll take the first one on the JVs. We did highlight all of these JVs. I think generally, these all sat at our Rattler entity before consolidating it. Generally, from a financial perspective, I think they're all good investments that eventually will be monetized at higher value than what we paid -- what we put in. But the strategy behind why we did these things is that we got commercial agreements and benefits locked in with the financial piece. So whether it's -- like the Gray Oak pipeline, right? We got 100,000 barrels a day of space on the pipeline, that's not changing even though we sold our equity interest in the pipe. On the gas processing side, we invested 20% into WTG. We and our partners decided to build 200 million a day cryo plants immediately after closing the deal, and that is alleviating a lot of the gas flaring and gas processing issues in the Northern Midland Basin. So we try to drive value through molecules committed to these investments, but generally, at some point, it makes sense to monetize them.  On the inventory side, we try to drill 15,000 feet wherever we can. I think most of our land in the Midland Basin is pretty locked up from a lateral length perspective. I think generally, if we had four sections North to South, we would drill through 10,000-foot laterals. If we had five sections North to South, which is rare, we would drill two sets of 12,500 foot laterals. And if we had three sections, we would drill 15,000-foot laterals over two 7,500-foot laterals. So we underwrote the FireBird deal with a lot of 15,000 footers because that is a big contiguous block. And on the other side, Lario, pretty landlocked in the center of Martin County with a lot of competitors around. So we kind of had to live with the lateral length as they were presented.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate : So I'll just ask, I think it was the case. I think you did touch on the M&A line of sight. I wonder if I could just dig into that a little bit more, particularly on the remaining asset sales and whether those are midstream weighted? Do you see additional opportunities in front of you that are midstream rated? And if so, are you basically looking to pay back your main exposure? I guess I'm really trying to understand how that impacts the cash flow of E&P business?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes. Good question, Doug. I would say, generally, we were surprised at the amount of E&P assets we sold relative to initial expectations of $500 million of noncore asset sales because we raised that to $1 billion. We're at $750 million to date. It's logical that most of those -- most of the rest of the $250 million or more come from noncore asset comes from midstream assets. I will say if they're -- it's going to be harder for us to sell operated midstream assets versus non-op midstream assets like the JVs that we highlighted in the back of our deck like you inferred, operated midstream assets do have an impact on LOE and financials. Whereas non-operated assets, you do have a cash flow impact from less distributions from those assets, but not as meaningful to the parent co. So I think it's logical that more non-op stuff is top of mind, but for the right value, some operated stuff would be on the table. Just we'd be cognizant of what that would do to our operating metrics.\nDoug Leggate : Okay. I guess we'll watch and see how -- the raise is obviously a positive. So thanks for the clarification. Guys, I apologize for being predictable. I'm going to put myself in the cross-hairs a little bit and go back to the cash tax question because it's through a sort of bit of a loop, to be perfectly honest. But it's about 50% bigger than the P&L tax. And what we are trying to figure out is, when E&P kicks in, which I guess would be the end of this year because you'll have had $1 billion of earnings presumably for three consecutive years, what in the $45 million of deferred tax, it's about 1/3 of your free cash flow, what do you think the normalized level of deferred tax would be if the conditions were the same? Is that an easy question to answer?\nKaes Van't Hof : Yes. I mean, I guess the answer would be, we're going to get through all of our NOL in 2023. So that will be exhausted, and we'll be a full cash taxpayer, although as you mentioned, we will be able to defer some with respect to intangible drilling costs and the CapEx we spend on the business. So I guess it will be dependent upon where -- obviously, where commodity prices are in 2024. And second to that, where CapEx is, I think we're obviously in a world where we're going to be spending -- continue to spend less than we make. So it's logical that there will be a tax burden. There's just too many variables right now to predict 2024.\nOperator: With no further questions, I would like to hand it back to Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Travis?\nTravis Stice: Thank you, again, to everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. That's it for today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes. I think also on top of that, Neal, we're going to be growing oil production per share significantly in 2023 through two well-timed acquisitions and a significant amount of buybacks in 2022. So per share metrics continue to improve. We continue to invest in high-return projects while not having to change our activity plan on a monthly basis trying to follow the crude price. The plan is the plan, and this steady state of activity has produced good results to date and no need to change that while it's working right now. Yes, Neil, great question. I think we announced two E&P asset sales, noncore asset sales this quarter that I think fit the mold of what the market looks like right now. And that's assets that don't compete for capital in our capital plan for many, many years and a little bit of PDP associated with those assets. But generally, a buyer that is looking to develop those assets a lot faster than we're planning. And so these two deals, the buyers are going to get aggressive developing these two assets right away, which in the capital allocators, it's just good capital allocation from our perspective. Going into it, we expected to sell more midstream assets than E&P assets. So that's why we bumped the target, and we still have some strategic midstream investments that are nearing the point where they should be monetized. Gray Oak, I think, was a great example. We retained all of our commercial benefits of the transaction. We still move our barrels to the Gulf Coast. But just that from a financial perspective, the pipeline was a great investment and it worked, and we monetize it to the partners. So I'd expect more on the midstream side. We did highlight what we have from a midstream perspective in the deck for the first time, but we're going to be patient and prudent when it comes to selling assets. Yes. Good question as well. I think the plan when we acquired Firebird, Firebird was producing 17,000 barrels of oil a day. We guided to that asset producing 19,000 barrels of oil a day for the year 2023. So clearly, some growth on that asset we're already seeing, but we'll see the majority of that benefit going into Q2 to Q4. And then on top of that, obviously, closing the Lario acquisition on January 31, that immediately adds 6,000 net barrels a day -- or sorry, subtracts 6,000 net barrels a day from Q1 because we didn't get to count those volumes in January. So base case plan is to grow steadily from Q1 through Q4, and we got the projects to back that up. Yes, great question, Arun. I think FireBird, at the end of the day, is the quintessential Diamondback deal, where we know the space and like the back of our hand and have been communicating with the FireBird team as they tested their position further West in the basin than others have in the past. And we follow the results closely and posted a couple of recent results that I think confirm a couple of things, but also give us some hope on upside in the central prospect. And there's a couple of wells sand the future may vary on the Far West side. This was probably the farthest West test to date and not an area we underwrote, and you have a very good Wolfcamp A result Far West. And then in the Southern portion of the position, you have this -- sorry, you have the four corners two-wells Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry. And we underwrote Lower Spraberry with Wolfcamp A upside across the central prospect, and it's looking more like you can have Lower Spraberry with Wolfcamp A co-development across that position.  So early days yet, but definitely a positive sign from the FireBird deal, and our technical team's work in getting that deal across the finish line. Yes, David, you're breaking up a little bit there. So I'm going to try to repeat what I thought you said, which is, what other zones are we testing outside of our traditional development zones across the basin. Is that correct? Yes, no problem. So generally, right, the majority of our capital is going to be allocated to the best zones, co-development. A big development this year in kind of the sale of Robertson Ranches and the Central Martin County area. So that's where the majority of capital is getting deployed. Certainly, there are deeper tests going on throughout the basin. We have our Limelight Prospect, which covers that those deeper zones, a tariff structure on the eastern side of the Midland Basin, where we're going to be developing some Woodford and Barnett. Generally, we're probably going to drill 3 or 4 wells there this year. I don't think it's going to be 10, 15 plus, but I think generally, promising results from the deeper zones across the basin and the benefit of our position is that we hold a lot of those deeper zones, and we have a significantly large mineral company that owns mineral rights to the center of the earth forever in all those zones. So if those zones start getting leased up, it's a great benefit to the Diamondback-FireBird relationship. Yes, again, breaking up a little bit, but talking about base declines. I think the base business, obviously, the base decline continued to decrease since being a maintenance mode from 2020. We did add two acquisitions in FireBird and Lario, where they have built a lot of rate very quickly. And so those two deals have a higher decline rate than the base business, but I think we've managed that in our guidance and also manage that in how we're going to complete wells across the pro forma position. So certainly, base decline is coming down, but I really think the best benefit of this lower growth environment is that we can grow per share metrics while not having to change our development plan with every $10 move in oil price, right? The plan is the plan right now. Shale has certainly become longer cycle with these bigger pads. And so, we're not having to put a stress on the ops teams to move pads around if oil moves $5 or $10 a barrel. Yes, Jeanine, I think a couple of things, right? Q4 was going to be a great quarter going into December. We had -- obviously, we all had a winter storm here. Diamondback did not announce the winter storm impact, but certainly, the winter storm did impact our production. So going into the last 10 days of the quarter, we felt very good about where we sat and still hit guidance. And therefore, from a POP perspective, we kind of moved some wells from Q4 into Q1 to get a head start on POPs. It's not a huge capital impact, but it is a number where we guide to first production. So there's a good amount of POPS in Q1 2023 because we were ahead of schedule in Q4 and feeling good about where we started Q1 this year. Yes, no change, Jeanine. Really, the variable is the output of how many shares we didn't buy back in a particular quarter, and the buyback is still going to be very opportunistic. And I think now that we've kind of gone through this for four or five quarters, you can see that we step in and buy back when things are weaker. There's still been a lot of volatility in the space. We're going through a period of that volatility right now. And so you look back at a quarter like Q4, bought back less shares in October and November, but hit the buyback very hard in December. And I think you can expect us to keep doing that and then having the variable be the output of what base dividend plus buyback doesn't get through in a particular quarter. Thanks, Derrick. I think the biggest benefit, Derrick, is not only the assets we acquired from QEP and guide on, I think that deal while done at a tough time hit exactly what you're looking for in a transaction, right? We allocate more capital to those assets that we would have allocated to the business prior to the deals. So we're seeing a little benefit there. Those assets are also in areas where you have three or four or even five zone development, and so we're having massive pads come on in high-return areas with a little bit of a benefit on the Viper side with high mineral interest across that position. So space -- as Travis mentioned earlier in the call, taking a close look at spacing, learning from other operators in the basin, what to do and what not to do and implementing that very quickly into our plan is paying dividends. The biggest headwind over the last six quarters has been casing costs. Now we can certainly see around the corner that maybe we're seeing some softening there. I'm not going to count on it until we see it, but casing has moved up from, let's call it, $40 or $50 a foot to $110 a foot. It's 20% of our Midland Basin well cost now, and that's a significant headwind over the last 6 quarters. I think the headwind is going to ease. If not, it's a little bit out of our control. But the things that we can control are the efficiencies gained from simul-frac operations. We'll probably have four simul-frac crews running by Q2 of this year, which is highly efficient, saves about $30 a foot versus conventional crews. And on top of that, two of those crews are going to be the Halliburton e-fleet Zeus crews, and those use less fuel, but also run on cheap Waha gas right now. So that saves another $15 or $20 a foot. So we're doing what we can to cut costs and keep costs as low as possible in an inflationary environment. Good question, Roger. I don't think flow assurance is going to be an issue for us, but we are exposed to the Waha price based on how the contracts are written. Through the history of Diamondback, we've been very acquisitive, and when we acquire things, it comes with contracts. And so, all those contracts are with private equity backed or some of the public gatherers and processors in the basin. So I feel really good about our flow assurance and our contracts, the issue is going to be price. And what we've seen in the basin is some tightness coming out of the basin on Waha when pipelines have gone up or gone down over the last six months. But really, there's a lot of processing capacity that's now coming on in the early part of 2023, particularly with two of our Midland Basin gatherers and processors. And I think that generally is going to move the issue further downstream. So it's going to be a tight gas market in the Permian. Henry Hub prices obviously aren't helping as well, but we feel good that the gas will move, and we're well hedged financially to protect from that downside. Great question, Roger. We don't believe in no hedges, I think, primarily because our balance sheet is a hedge. Our cost structures are hedged, but we consider our base dividend debt, right? And our base dividend is now $3.20 a share. It's almost $550 million of outflows a year. We think it's well protected today at $40 a barrel but we don't want to put that in harm's way. So we buy puts as fire insurance, and we basically use the front quarter to extend duration three or four quarters out. We try to be 50% to 60% hedged going into a particular quarter on oil down to 0% hedge four, five quarters out. So I think you can continue to expect us to do that, and your observations are 100% correct that in the back half of the year, it will grow as we go through the year. Good question, Jeoff. I think, generally, we guided to this year being around 15% year-over-year well costs, sub-10% from what we highlighted in November. And I would say, generally, those numbers still fit today. I would say, we're probably in the upper half of our well cost guidance for both Midland and Delaware today. But generally, there are some things coming our way outside of service cost deflation and that's another Halliburton Zeus e-fleet moving to four simul-fracs versus last year, we ran three in a spot crew. So that last simul-frac adds some efficiency. And I kind of put the budget two ways this year. I think if we see deflation, we're going to be closer to the lower half of our guide. And if we stay flat, we'll be to midpoint to the higher end. But I think generally, the anecdotes are coming in that some things are heading our way from a service cost perspective. And unlike last year, not everything -- not every line item will go up in the AFE. I think, generally, Scott, they complete a similar amount of lateral feet as the simul-frac crews as we're seeing early time. But on top of that, e-fleets on a fuel efficiency basis, not just the type of fuel, but the efficiency of the fuel used has been a positive surprise. I think the last thing I would add is that it does operate on a much smaller footprint. So maybe your moves are smaller, but you do have some electrical infrastructure associated with those fleets. Dan, do you want to add anything on that? Yes. Good question, Kevin. The biggest benefit we did receive in the fourth quarter, obviously, commodity prices came down quarter-over-quarter, Q3 to Q4. So that was a surprise for the positive on cash taxes. I guess that hurts you overall. But the biggest deferral we got was when we closed the FireBird deal came with about $100 million of midstream assets and some other fixed assets that we're able to depreciate right away, and so that allowed us to defer more taxes into 2023. As we've modeled 2023, we still have about $1 billion of NOL that will be exhausted this year. But on top of that, also closing the FireBird or the Lario transaction, which added some midstream and fixed assets as well. So generally, this is kind of our last year before being a full cash taxpayer. About two well timed deals allowed us to push out a little more cash. Obviously, it's not the reason why we do the deals, but it's a nice tangential benefit. Yes. I don't know if sellers are ever reasonable, Leo. But generally, I do think the two larger transactions did happen because Diamondback's cost structure was differential in the second half of the year and going into 2023, right? We're drilling wells $2 million, $3 million, $4 million cheaper in the Midland Basin than peers, and that is when you underwrite PUDs, that drives value to the good guys even if you're not running strip oil pricing. So I think generally, that's what's happened. There's less and less large opportunities like the two that we announced last fall. So it's relatively quiet at the moment. But some of the smaller things that tend to trend with the large deals like the blocking and tackling, a couple of other deals that Firebird and Lario we're working on when they sold. That's the kind of stuff that we're focused on right now. Great. Thank you, Paul. I'll take the first one on the JVs. We did highlight all of these JVs. I think generally, these all sat at our Rattler entity before consolidating it. Generally, from a financial perspective, I think they're all good investments that eventually will be monetized at higher value than what we paid -- what we put in. But the strategy behind why we did these things is that we got commercial agreements and benefits locked in with the financial piece. So whether it's -- like the Gray Oak pipeline, right? We got 100,000 barrels a day of space on the pipeline, that's not changing even though we sold our equity interest in the pipe. On the gas processing side, we invested 20% into WTG. We and our partners decided to build 200 million a day cryo plants immediately after closing the deal, and that is alleviating a lot of the gas flaring and gas processing issues in the Northern Midland Basin. So we try to drive value through molecules committed to these investments, but generally, at some point, it makes sense to monetize them.  On the inventory side, we try to drill 15,000 feet wherever we can. I think most of our land in the Midland Basin is pretty locked up from a lateral length perspective. I think generally, if we had four sections North to South, we would drill through 10,000-foot laterals. If we had five sections North to South, which is rare, we would drill two sets of 12,500 foot laterals. And if we had three sections, we would drill 15,000-foot laterals over two 7,500-foot laterals. So we underwrote the FireBird deal with a lot of 15,000 footers because that is a big contiguous block. And on the other side, Lario, pretty landlocked in the center of Martin County with a lot of competitors around. So we kind of had to live with the lateral length as they were presented. Yes. Good question, Doug. I would say, generally, we were surprised at the amount of E&P assets we sold relative to initial expectations of $500 million of noncore asset sales because we raised that to $1 billion. We're at $750 million to date. It's logical that most of those -- most of the rest of the $250 million or more come from noncore asset comes from midstream assets. I will say if they're -- it's going to be harder for us to sell operated midstream assets versus non-op midstream assets like the JVs that we highlighted in the back of our deck like you inferred, operated midstream assets do have an impact on LOE and financials. Whereas non-operated assets, you do have a cash flow impact from less distributions from those assets, but not as meaningful to the parent co. So I think it's logical that more non-op stuff is top of mind, but for the right value, some operated stuff would be on the table. Just we'd be cognizant of what that would do to our operating metrics. Yes. I mean, I guess the answer would be, we're going to get through all of our NOL in 2023. So that will be exhausted, and we'll be a full cash taxpayer, although as you mentioned, we will be able to defer some with respect to intangible drilling costs and the CapEx we spend on the business. So I guess it will be dependent upon where -- obviously, where commodity prices are in 2024. And second to that, where CapEx is, I think we're obviously in a world where we're going to be spending -- continue to spend less than we make. So it's logical that there will be a tax burden. There's just too many variables right now to predict 2024."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. 2022 was another great year for Diamondback. We successfully executed on our capital program, accelerated our return of capital plan and generated record cash flow. I'm very proud of all that we were able to accomplish and look forward to what I believe will be another strong year for the company. Looking back at last year, we produced over 223,000 barrels of oil per day, exceeding our production expectations. This is primarily the result of our well performance, which continues to trend in the right direction as our normalized oil production in the Midland Basin improved by 6% year-over-year and nearly 20% when compared to 2020. We continue to optimize our multi-zone co-development strategy, which we pivoted to prior to the pandemic by tweaking our frac designs, spacing assumptions and landing zones to maximize our returns.  On the operations side, we've also built out substantial water infrastructure, which allows us to implement simul-frac completions across our position. This type of completion is consistently more efficient than a traditional zipper frac design because we can complete approximately 80 wells per year with just one crew. When you add in the additional efficiencies we're seeing from our Halliburton e-fleet, our completion savings are approximately $50 a foot. Last year was not without its challenges from significant inflationary pressures, particularly with casing, equipment availability and weather-related downtime. However, our operational team did what it always does, deliver best-in-class execution. Our ability to hold our capital budget flat and stay within our original guidance range while also exceeding our production target is something you should expect from Diamondback as we push to deliver differentiated results quarter after quarter. Financially, we generated over $7 billion in EBITDA and $4.6 billion in free cash flow or nearly $26 per share, both records for the company. We made significant progress on our return of capital plan, increasing our cash return commitment in the middle of the year to return at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders. In total, we returned 68% of our free cash flow in 2022, which equates to $3.1 billion through a combination of our base and variable dividend and share repurchase program, buying back nearly 8.7 million shares at an average price of $126 per share for a total of $1.1 billion. This represents 5% of our shares outstanding when we announced our program in September of 2021. An additional $2 billion was returned through our base and variable dividend with the total dividend growth of nearly 5x when compared to 2021. In total, we returned $11.31 per share in dividends.  In the fourth quarter alone, we returned over $860 million or $5.65 per share with a total dividend yield of nearly 9%. This included an increase to our annual base dividend of $0.20, now $3.20 per share annually or $0.80 per quarter, representing 54% year-over-year growth. We also announced multiple strategic transactions in the fourth quarter that better position us for the long term. We made two Midland Basin acquisitions, Lario and FireBird, both of which are now closed and seamlessly integrated that added over 500 high-quality opportunities and 83,000 net acres to our portfolio. This additional inventory, along with the associated production and cash flow, has solidified our size and scale in the Midland Basin, giving us a strategic advantage as we execute on our capital programs for the decades to come.  Last summer, we bought in all the outstanding units of Rattler, which gives us additional flexibility to think strategically about our existing midstream portfolio. We now have the ability to monetize assets that trade at a higher multiple than our upstream business and use the proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet or acquire additional upstream assets. The first example of this was the sale of our 10% interest in the Gray Oak crude oil pipeline to Enbridge. We achieved a 1.75 multiple on our invested capital and used the proceeds to partially fund the cash portion of the Lario acquisition.  As we evaluated both our Rattler operated assets and equity method investments, we've also monetized multiple noncore upstream positions. We have now divested nearly $600 million in upstream assets since the third quarter of last year, which includes two recent deals in Southeast Glasscock and Ward and Winkler counties. These assets simply did not compete for immediate capital within our portfolio. We have now increased our noncore asset target sales from $500 million to at least $1 billion by the end of this year. Last year, we improved our leverage ratio, now below 1x, and also pushed the tenor of nearly 90% of our debt past 5 years, with over $2 billion due in the 2050 at an average coupon of below 5%. We will continue to use free cash flow and proceeds from our noncore asset sales to lower our overall debt profile, continually improving our financial position. As we move into 2023, we expect to deliver relatively flat pro forma production year-over-year. When you account for the 11 months of Lario and a full year of FireBird production contribution, our guidance reflects 260,000 barrels of oil a day and $2.6 billion in CapEx, while running 15 rigs and 4 simul-frac crews. In closing, 2022 was an outstanding year for the company. We generated record free cash flow and distributed nearly 70% of it to our shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet, extended our inventory runway and continue to produce one of the highest margin barrels in the industry. Looking ahead, our business model is working, and we are confident in our 2023 outlook and our ongoing ability to continue generating peer-leading returns for our stockholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Neal, I don't think the macro conditions are dictating any kind of production growth currently. I mean you still have an uncertain Fed action. You've got uncertainty around China COVID, demand recovery. You've still got Russian barrels that are still finding their way into the market. So it doesn't appear to me that the macro conditions have fundamentally changed. And certainly, the feedback -- and perhaps, most importantly, the feedback we get from our shareholders are encouraging us to continue to embrace a shareholder return more. Yes. It's certainly not just one thing, Neal. It's really a combination of all the things that we focus on really multiple times a day when it comes to executing our program. Certainly, well productivity enhancements add to that, but that's really an output of a very difficult decision we made in 2019 to pivot away from kind of the best two zone development strategy and embrace the multi-zone full section development strategy, which we're seeing benefits of today. You also hear us talk frequently about our cost structure and that cost structure is made up not only on the expense side where -- whether it's G&A or LOE, but also on the capital efficiency side where we continue to push the envelope, particularly on the variable cost side of things, simply doing more with less. And all of those things combined, I think, put us consistently towards the top of the most margin efficient producer in the basin. Yes. Good question, Arun. In 2018 and early 2019, we were really studying this co-development strategy intently, and the significant observation that we made from our analysis was that essentially, all of these zones talk to each other. And if they talk to each other, which means you actually have pressure communication during the fracking operations, which subsequently also means that you're kind of sharing the reserves as an individual well is produced that if you don't get them upon initial -- the initial development that when you go back in later, you'll find those zones have experienced some depletion and that depletion degrades the efficiency of your stimulated rock volume, which ultimately changes the production profile. And so in order to address that, we examined our spacing assumptions, both side to side and top to bottom, and made adjustments to try to minimize those frac pressure interferences. Spread some zones out further, spread some zones above and below further, but essentially went into a section -- half of section this time was our development strategy and completed all the wells at one time and then brought them all on at one time. And that was a painful decision because it's a lot easier. In fact, I've been -- I've said it before that I'll take criticism from drilling the very best zone, but we found out that, that actually wasn't the right development strategy, and we took some things for that in 2019. But as you can see, we put some details in our -- on Slide 16, as you alluded to. We're -- in the Midland Basin, our well results are equivalent to what we were seeing in 2017.  So very proud of the technical team and their diligence to try to crack a very difficult problem and then the courage to stay with that decision through periods when we were questioned about that development strategy. So I hope that answers your question, Arun. Thank you, Derrick. Yes. I think you've got just a couple things that are impacting LOE. First, we're fairly exposed to the power market, and we rode through the back half of last year fairly unhedged through the -- we're up in gas prices and that really impacted our real-time power pricing, and you've seen kind of real-time power pricing kind of stay a little elevated through the first part of 2023 here. And so trying to guess where we're going to land with respect to power and have an opportunity to get hedged to protect ourselves, but -- so that's adding about a dime. And then you've got another impact from the FireBird acquisition with about 900 vertical wells, which had another dime or two to our consolidated LOE. So between those two things, you're looking at about a quarter, and we think we're probably running in the lower end of the guide today. And if we see some things come our way, we think we could potentially be under the guide, but we're not baking that into our guidance. Thank you, again, to everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes. I think we've only been running the first crew for about six months, and we've been really impressed with the performance thus far. It's outperformed our other fleets kind of on the margin, but not too measurable. We do believe that over time, you'll see that gap widen in performance, just really believe that the maintenance required around the e-fleet equipment will be substantially less. So we're excited to learn through that with Halliburton and recognize some added efficiencies on top of just fuel savings as we go forward. Yes. I mean we don't really have any long-term contracts in place. We kind of have shorter cycle pricing agreements I think generally, we're exposed to market pricing across the board, and we certainly have some protections in place on some of our consumables, but if we start seeing the market soften, which we feel like is a pretty good likelihood with where we see gas prices today, that should trickle down into the oil basins, particularly on the drilling services side of things first. And we've certainly not seen a lot of upward pressure on pricing in the first part of this year. It's been pretty quiet, and hopefully, we'll start seeing some help on the inflation front here through the second and third quarter."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Adam Lawlis.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam. And before we start with my prepared remarks this morning, I want to encourage each of you to please take advantage of one of our greatest privileges we have as Americans, our freedom to elect our representatives. Please take the time off your busy schedules today to go vote, if you've not already done so. Welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. A Diamondback, we pride ourselves on our execution. Our commitment to being the lowest cost operator in the Permian Basin has and will continue to position us for success through the cycle. The third quarter was no exception. In the quarter, we produced over 224,000 barrels of oil per day and generated approximately $1.7 billion in operating cash flow. Our CapEx was once again within our guidance range, leading to free cash flow of nearly $1.2 billion. As we previously announced, we increased our return of capital commitment and stated that beginning this quarter, we would return at least 75% of free cash flow back to our shareholders, up from at least 50% previously. At 75%, total capital return was nearly $875 million, with dividends totaling $403 million or $2.26 per share. The remaining $472 million went towards our opportunistic share repurchase program, where we bought back nearly 4 million shares at an average price of approximately $120 a share. To date, we've spent approximately $1.2 billion of our $4 billion buyback authorization, repurchasing nearly 6% of our shares outstanding since September of last year when we initiated our program. In October, we announced the pending acquisition of the assets of FireBird Energy, a company with a large, contiguous position in the Midland Basin. We feel FireBird has right balance of cash flow and inventory and the acquisition is immediately accretive on all relevant per share financial metrics while providing a long runway of high-quality drilling opportunities. With over 350 locations, we expect to have well over a decade of run room at our projected one-rig development phase. In conjunction with the acquisition, we announced that we would sell at least $500 million of non-core assets by the year-end 2023, with net proceeds primarily used to pay down debt. Since then, we closed on a $155 million sale of non-core assets in the Delaware Basin, jump-starting our program and ensuring continuous improvement to our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to pursue strategic divestitures, including the sale of certain assets within our Rattler portfolio, generating unrealized value for our shareholders. In closing, we know our business. We know we have some of the best inventory in the United States with our low-cost operational machine in place. We have the unique ability to generate significant repeatable returns through the drill bit for decades to come. In 2019, we began co-developing our primary targets. Since then, we've learned how to optimize our development patterns and spacing, and as a result, are seeing material improvement in well productivity over the past 36 months. In fact, our well performance this year is back at 2019 levels, when we were primarily targeting one-off wells in our -- zones, which while having great performance and economics and the potential to withstand significant components of our inventory, leading to material parent-child concerns down the line. Fortunately, we are well positioned for the future. We expect to close on the FireBird transaction at the end of November and slow the development pace on that asset from three rigs to one. We are working with our service providers to ensure that we have the most efficient and cost-effective personnel and equipment in place for next year, including the two e-fleet simul-frac crews we've secured from Halliburton, the first of which is already in the field and performing well. All of this will provide operational momentum as we move into 2023 we expect to deliver the same operational results you've come to expect from Diamondback. While we won't be giving detailed for the 2023 guidance today, we believe that we'll be able to generate low single-digit pro forma oil production growth next year by maintaining our current standalone activity levels plus the one additional FireBird rig. It's not easy to operate in this environment, but our size, scale and quality of the inventory uniquely position us to deliver differentiated results and create meaningful value for our shareholders. Before I open up for questions, I want to address all the Diamondback employees that are on the phone. At Diamondback, we've just celebrated our 10 years as a public company, growing from a $500 million market cap to almost $30 billion today. The people around me this morning and sometimes me individual get too much credit for the success. It's you, the men and women of Diamondback that deserve the credit. It's your pursuit of excellence, your desire to be the very best version of yourself, your dedication to integrity that is responsible for our success. It remains my privilege to represent you. Thank you for all that you do. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: Thanks. Good morning Travis and team. Travis, my first question is on your developmental strategy, specifically, could you all discuss if you have or will continue to develop, you mentioned, I think it's Slide 7, you've gone to the co-development, you all went there really, I think, before a lot of others did. And I'm just wondering, are you going to do that is that pretty much on all the assets included when you take over FireBird, and I'm just wondering the second part of that, are there parts of this process that you believe you still have an advantage over peers. It just seems to me when I'm looking at sort of margins in the perm, you all still are leading. So I'm just wondering, if there are some things you're doing when looking at that Slide 7 that you still think are leading as sort of the pack.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah, Neal, good question. This is Kaes. I think generally, we obviously had a tough earnings call at the end of 2019, when we made this shift to co-development. I think we learned very, very quickly from that as well as moving more of our capital to the Midland Basin. And I think just generally, the teams have done a really good job on not only spacing within each zone, but the intra-zonal spacing given that these zones talk to each other. And the result is better overall assets here over the last couple of years. So nothing is going to change there. I think we're going to keep co-developing. And in fact, in some ways, we'll end up doing some larger pads, and we even have prior given the amount of virgin rock we have in that sale of Robertson Ranch area that is kicking off in a real way right now. I think generally \u2013 on the other \u2013 on the other question, well costs are certainly the biggest advantage we have as a company at Diamondback, and that's a cultural thing from top to bottom. We're very focused on cost, very focused on keeping costs down in this inflationary environment. I think that gives us an advantage, particularly in looking at stuff like FireBird, right? FireBird we're going to co-develop a lot of zones up in the north at a low cost structure and that central position. There's opportunities for upside, if we bring the Wolfcamp B into the Lower Spraberry development. And that, I think the testament that we can drill them cheap, the returns make sense to compete for capital.\nNeal Dingmann: Yeah, it really sounds encouraging. Then turn to my second question, well, I guess, I'd call it the topic your and that's on shareholder return and capital allocation. Travis, for you or Kaes, I mean, do you see any scenario where you all would back off that 75% payout and maybe turn to more growth or something else? And then on the capital allocation, obviously, you all had a nice stock move. How do you feel about the buybacks versus it is?\nTravis Stice: Look, we've seen the volatility in the market that every quarter, we've had the opportunity to buy shares back. And when that opportunity presents itself, we'll do so aggressively. I think the key to any of those questions is the ability to generate free cash flow. And that's certainly what our focus is, and then maintaining the flexibility on how the return of that free cash flow gets prosecuted. I will say that in conversations with our long-only shareholders. A lot of those guys prefer to get the cash back. But again, we believe that we'll have opportunities to repurchase shares back.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. And then no change to the 35% of free cash flow, while it's certainly a restrictive amount of cash to be giving back to the equity holders, we feel that our balance sheet is in a position to be able to do that. And we're still going to reduce debt through non-core asset sales or free cash flow generation and our debt structure is significantly better than it has probably ever been in our company history. So generally, we feel that, it's time for our equity holders to get their cash back after this company has matured from a high-growth company to a high-returning company.\nNeal Dingmann: Yeah, I would agree. Your total shareholder return certainly speaks for itself. Thanks, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Neal.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Good morning, team, and congrats on 10 years that pass by very fast. So, well done here, my first question is on 2023 capital spending and any early thoughts here as we bridge from your 2022 levels to next year? And talk about all the moving parts ranging from inflation activity?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question, Neil. I think while we're not ready to throw in the towel that well costs are going to keep going up next year, we do have some things coming our way from an efficiency perspective. But I'll kind of lay it out two ways. Based on the $1.9 billion that Diamondback is going to spend on capital this year, pre FireBird. I would assume we're probably up 10% to 15% from that number gone ahead if we had to make that decision today on well costs. I think another way to think about it is basically in Diamondback today is pre-FireBird at a $500 million run rate of capital, I would say, somewhere below 10% increase off of that makes sense. And then in both scenarios, adding the $250 million of CapEx for FireBird, we ran that deal on current well costs. So those current well costs are running through that the capital free cash flow numbers that we put in for that deal. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think certainly, there are some things that could go our way. Casing has been a massive headwind for us and for the industry. Midland Basin, casing is now $110 a foot, that is a huge number of -- on a fixed cost that we can't really control here.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. And then we'll look for a little more clarity, but that's a helpful starting point. And then Travis, a question for you is just on your outlook for US shale growth. I think a number of industry participants have been surprised by how flat the US production profile has looked here over the last several months. And so curious on your thoughts on shale maturity? And is the lack of growth that we're seeing relative to expectations a function of service bottlenecks, or is it a function of also asset maturity?\nTravis Stice: A lot to unpack in that question, Neal, but I think it's really all of the above. I think there is asset maturation. I think certainly, supply chain constraints are also limiting growth. I think for public companies, the continued discipline that we've all been demonstrating on shareholder returns versus a commitment to growth. I think all of those factors weigh into more of a muted production growth from US shale going forward. That said, out here in the Permian, I think we're still continuing to hit production records every month, somewhere close to 5.3 million to 5.5 million barrels a day. But that's going to be challenged to continue to grow that into the future. Do we have the assets out here? Yes, we do. But some of those other topical constraints that I mentioned are going to be impediments to efficient growth assume we'll probably see at higher commodity prices some people try to grow, but they're allocating capital if they're very trailing into of efficiency. So those also create headwinds as well for shareholders.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, gentlemen. Kaes or Travis, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the evolution of your co-development strategy, which you shifted in 2019. You highlighted how your well productivity now has returned to 2017 levels. I wondered to see if maybe you could also maybe compare and contrast how Diamondback's development looks like relative to many of your peers, because you highlighted how you believe you're completing the most number of zones per pad in the Midland Basin?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah, Arun, I'll focus more on what Diamondback is doing. We certainly do a lot of competitor analysis and learn a lot from our competitors on what to do and what not to do in the basin. So generally, we have a data analytics team that looks at inter-lateral and reserve spacing, and how many wells are completing per pad and per zone and how close the nearest well bore is. And our math tells us that we're finding a striking a good balance here between IRR and NPV. We may not have the highest oil per foot, but certainly spacing wells a little tighter, as well as co-developing more economic zones together and I expect that trend to continue to head our way. In some ways, these higher commodity prices bring more zones into the equation and maybe even one or two wells per zone. But generally, spacing has stayed fairly consistent here for the last couple of years. So credit to the team for looking at what we've done, what's gone well, what's gone poorly and adjusting accordingly. And I think we're set up now for a few years of very solid development, particularly in the Midland Basin side.\nArun Jayaram: Great, great. And then maybe just my quick follow-up. As you guys have now started to develop some of the assets you bought from Guidon and QEP in Central Martin County, can you give us a sense of how the early wells have been trending? And what type of mix should we expect in Martin County on a go-forward basis over the next couple of years?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. I mean, certainly, when we go back to that deal, we basically said we did these two deals to get better and not bigger. And I think that's proving out in the performance of the wells and the performance since then. We're just getting started in the main block. There's probably a 24-well pad coming on here in early 2023, and we'll continue to develop that sale in Robertson block very aggressively with probably a three-rig run rate until it's drilled up in three or four years. And that should drive the lion's share of operational performance. Not to be outdone by that, though, we have seen very good well results up in the Northwest portion of Martin County this year due to some adjustments on spacing and landing targets, and I'm proud to say certainly some of the shallower zones, Middle Spraberry has looked very, very good up there relative to prior expectations.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning all.\nTravis Stice: Hey, good morning Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Travis, with the understanding that you guys have limited exposure to Waha in 2023 and the recent weakness was really driven by maintenance. Could you speak to your macro views on gas ingress over the next few years? And how you plan to mitigate your exposure over time?\nTravis Stice: Yeah. Certainly, it's going to be tight. I'll let Kaes give some specifics on that. But I think gas takeaway is going to be talked really certainly most of next year, probably well into 2024 as well until we get some of the major pipes on. So we do think \u2013 we do opportunistic hedging, particularly against the \u2013 on the Waha side. And we've committed to some of these pipes that are help making sure we get gas not only that doesn't go to Waha, but goes directly to the Gulf Coast.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yeah. I mean, basically, next year, two-third of our gas goes to Waha, and that's all been hedged today, actually hedged a while back. And the other third gets Gulf Coast exposure on the Whistler pipeline. And then as you think about 2024, we think there's going to be pockets of weakness in 2024, certainly easing in the back half of the year when the big pipe Matterhorn comes on, but it's going to be tight from now until then, because some of these expansions, yeah, there are 500 million a day expansion, but I think they're going to be full right away.\nDerrick Whitfield: Terrific. And as my follow-up, I wanted to focus on your operational efficiency. Given the improvements you've experienced in D&C efficiency metrics really over the last couple of years, most would expect efficiency to ply to due to the law of diminishing returns and the dilution of experienced crews. As you guys look forward in time, what are the levers you're hoping to pull to improve or at least maintain your operational efficiency?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yeah, a good question. I think the biggest thing that's going to help us next year from a cost perspective are the two Halliburton e-fleets that one has just started and one is picking up. I think generally, on the horsepower side, we get charged a little bit less. They make more margin on that particular piece of business. On top of that, we're not spending money on diesel, right? So we're fueling that fleet with cheap Waha gas for the next couple of years, and that could be anywhere from $10 to $15 a foot of savings depending on what the price of Waha is. And we just opened our first mobile mine or mini mine that's going to be right offset some of our Martin County position. So I think generally, while we're not drilling wells to TD faster than we were last year, we're still best in class in that area. Now, it's time to work on the other pieces of the cost equation as inflation heats up here.\nTravis Stice: Yeah. And Derrick, there's a lot of conversations always when you see activity levels increase in the Permian Basin about the impacts of the inexperienced or green hands, we call them. But I don't follow that line of thinking, because it's our job as supervisors of those activities to make sure that even the least experienced individual has the right supervision to perform this job not only safely, but efficiently. So they almost actually transfers not to the service companies, within experienced hands, it transfers to our operations organization and our field supervisors to make sure they can provide the oversight to prosecute our plans effectively, efficiently and safely.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great, update. Thanks for your time.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Thanks, everyone for taking my question today.\nTravis Stice: You\u2019re welcome, David. Good morning.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good morning. I wanted to follow-up just on the $500 million non-core asset divestiture program, $155 million achieved already on some PDP. Travis, you highlighted in your prepared remarks, some of the Rattler assets. I kind of feel like Diamondback isn't getting credit for us. Should we think about that as representing the bulk of the remaining non-core targets? And could you give us a little bit more detail about the scope of that asset?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yeah. I mean really, David, it's all value, right? But generally, internally, we see that an E&P business trades at 4, 5 times and a pipeline or a gathering system trades at 8 to 10 times. So it's logical for us, with us not getting any credit for it in our valuation to look at some of the JVs that we invested in alongside contributing volumes to those businesses over the last five years. And now, I think they're in kind of a harvest mode where it might make sense to sell, particularly given our buying of Rattler and renewed focus on the upstream business, which is what we're so good at. So, I won't commit to certain projects, but there are certainly some of our JVs were sitting on big wins, and you could expect us to try to monetize those appropriately over time.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate the color on that, and good luck with those. Maybe just a second one for me. I know we talked a lot about well productivity, but obviously, it's on that slide 7, you guys highlight continued well productivity improvements in the Midland Basin. I guess as we think about going into 2023, I think you guys have highlighted you'll continue to allocate more activity towards some of the virgin rock areas like Robertson Ranch. Also seems like the overall Midland productivity is benefiting from high grading into Martin and Midland. With FireBird, I guess you're putting one rig on there. I guess when you look out, how long does this mix be -- how long is this mix maintains with this sort of intense high-grading within Martin and Midland where we might expect that productivity per well or on a per foot basis to be sustained at these levels are perhaps improving?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean I think it's going to be around for a while, certainly longer than the market can see today, which I think is important, right? We have two well-timed deals in 2020 that that we're benefiting from today. I think generally, our job is to allocate capital to the best returning zones and projects first. So, we won't be able to keep this up forever. But I think as the shale cost curve goes up, which is likely to happen over the next decade, our job is to maintain a cost structure and an inventory that keeps us at the low end of that cost curve. And that's what we've built this business on. And I think we have both the inventory and definitely the cost structure to be able to keep ourselves at the low end of that cost curve longer.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. Thank you, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions.\nKaes Van't Hof: Good morning, Jeoffrey.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Just a couple for me on the FireBird acreage, in particular, a little bit on productivity, but also a bit on inventory. I saw in the deck that you highlighted some small results on that acreage. I just wanted to get your thoughts on if there are any potential implications there from an inventory standpoint? If you could maybe speak to how the locations you've spoken to, to this point that asset are distributed across the position? And secondly, what sort of upside you might contemplate in terms of inventory based on some of these results?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Jeoff great question. When we announced the deal, we got one with a lot of people, but we haven't been on a big call like this. We basically said the northern prospect, which you can see on slide 8 in our deck, competes for capital right away, and that's the game plan is to allocate that rig to that northern prospect for the first few years of the deal. I think generally, recent well results in the Central prospect would bring in the Wolfcamp A upside into co-development. We underwrote six across in the Lower Spraberry across that block, and that's what we paid for. But, recent well results of co-developing the LSE looked pretty promising today. We have some time to kind of test that out before full field development, but that's kind of the underwritten upside of the trade.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nTravis Stice: Thank you Jeof,\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Hi, good morning Travis, Dan and Kaes. Thanks for taking my question \nKaes Van't Hof: Good morning, Jeanine.\nJeanine Wai: First, question, maybe just going back to the 2022 guide. The updated guidance for wells drilled, it's now a little bit lower at 260 for the year versus 270 to 290 before, I think. Can you talk about what's driving that number lower now? And how that really impacts operational momentum into next year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Jeanine, I won't say it interrupts operational momentum into next year because it's our job to not have those issues. We are running a couple of extra intermediate rigs today to get ahead of these large pads where the big rig follows. So I think the message is nothing to see here from operational momentum. That's what you expect us to do, and that's what we do best. Just -- I would just say, we probably completed a couple of more wells in the Delaware than we originally expected this year, and we ran probably one less rig than we thought for the year. So -- on the other side of the equation, we're completing probably 15 less wells than we went into the year expected to complete. So your capital efficiency is certainly looking good and momentum feels very good going into 2023.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. Definitely, I stand out these days in E&P. Wonderful. Thank you for clarity. Maybe our second question is just a quick housekeeping one. In your prepared remarks on 2023, you talked about low single-digit growth on a year-over-year adjusted basis. What baseline oil number should we be using or assuming it's like 220 a day for legacy FANG, but we're not quite sure what to assume for FireBird since we only have commentary for 4Q, and that's only for like a month. So just a housekeeping question on that. Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question. I think we did release 19,000 barrels of oil a day net for FireBird in 2023 and that is not changing. The base business FANG, we went into 2022 saying we're going to keep 220,000 barrels of oil a day flat. We've kind of outperformed that a little bit this year. But basically, you can take that 220, complete the same number of wells as we expected at the pre FireBird Diamondback level, and that should spit out a couple of percentage points of low single-digit growth. And then add that FireBird 19 on top of that, and nothing's changed here from our perspective. You think that what you expect us to do, be transparent and hit these numbers.\nJeanine Wai: Great. Thanks, gentlemen.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Jeanine.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTim Rezvan: Hi, good morning, folks. Some of my questions have been addressed. So I think I'll just ask one. Obviously, you opened the door a bit talking about election day today. And I'm just curious if you could talk about if either Diamondback or any of your industry trade groups have had any discussions with the Biden administration in DC about these perceived oil shortages in the US? And any context you can provide would be helpful.\nTravis Stice: Yes, certainly not specifically inside Diamondback. But yes, aggressively so with the trade organizations that Diamondback is a part of. At the federal level, API, APC we have a lot of sweat equity invested in both of those trade organizations that we lean in alongside all of our industry peers to provide some clear strategies into the White House and the current administration. So \u2013 and that will continue regardless of how the results of the elections turn out today. That's our advocacy arm, and we think it's important for our shareholders to be a dynamic part of that advocacy.\nTim Rezvan: Okay. And then I guess the follow-up is, do you believe that anybody do you see is listening to the sort of the domestic group of producers?\nTravis Stice: Yeah, it certainly seems like the rhetoric has turned decidedly against the industry again in the lead up to these elections. We can only open pray for that our citizens continue to elect morally and ethically excellent representatives, so that we can send people to Washington, D.C. that do a will of the people. And Diamondback is going to continue to do our part like I said, through advocacy, both locally and at the state and federal level as we navigate this very difficult rhetoric that's being addressed or pointed at our industry.\nTim Rezvan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the comments.\nTravis Stice: You bet. Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\nJohn Abbott: Good morning. This is John Abbott for Doug Leggate. Again, thank you for taking our questions.\nTravis Stice: Hey, John.\nJohn Abbott: Our first question is on capital allocation. Approximately 80% of your CapEx is to the Midland this year, 20% to the Del, and you sort of look over a multiyear horizon. At what point would you anticipate that the Delaware would become a better or a larger percentage of your overall CapEx?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Honestly, quite frankly, we look at all our inventory of keep that 80-20 steady for a long time. So I don't think there's any plans to change it. In some ways, with the FireBird acquisition, some more wells completed there will probably be closer to 85-15 Midland, Delaware. And I think the curves that we posted on slide 7 proved out that our Midland Basin is certainly top notch, and that's where we're going to be focused.\nJohn Abbott: Appreciate it. And then our second question is on sustainable free cash flow. So, the wells you're drilling this year are over 10,000 foot laterals. Looking at your slide, I think it's about two-thirds of your inventory is about 10,000 foot laterals while the one-third is less than that. So over a multiyear horizon, how do you think about your ability to sustain free cash flow?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: I think generally, we have a significant amount of long lateral development ahead of us. At some point, naturally, if we can't get trades done block up acreage, we're going to have to reduce our lateral lengths. But I think on the other hand, you have a lower decline production allowing you to maintain capital efficiency for a longer period of time. So we look at it every quarter, total inventory, total development. And as far as we can see, things look very good for Diamondback's capital efficiency for the next few years.\nJohn Abbott: Appreciate it, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nTravis Stice: Thanks John.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.\nCharles Meade: Good morning Travis, Kaes and the rest of the Diamondback group.\nTravis Stice: Hi. Good morning, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Travis, I'd like to ask a question back to the FireBird asset. You guys laid out this view along the North-South-axis. But can you give us some of the, I guess, how the prospectivity changes West or -- East to West? And my understanding is, you're starting to approach or get up onto the Central Basin platform on -- particularly on the western side of that central prospect, and I think it even your Limelight prospect there. So, are there any promising puzzles you're working on, on that side, or is that something we should be thinking about for -- in the near future, or is that a project its way down the line?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah, good question. I don't think it's anything in the near-term. There certainly are some results further West that early time look promising. We didn't underwrite kind of two-mile buffer on the West side for LS prospectivity, but certainly did -- there's certainly some untapped upside with some Barnett and Woodford results nearby, including our Limelight prospects. So that play is getting a lot of attention. But at the end of the day, our investors expect us to underwrite what we're going to develop. And right now, that's all on unvalued upside, which technology and costs work out, it will be certainly prospective into the next decade when we get to drilling it.\nTravis Stice: And you'll see our development strategy, Charles, as we've moved to that central block, as Kaes laid out as kind of our Phase 2 drilling, but we'll start East and work West. And I think the two wells that are labeled E and F on slide 8 are good examples of what that early development scenario look like. While we didn't complete those wells, the results are really promising. And we're excited about them. But Phase 1 will be up to the North, which is very akin to our Spanish Trail development, and then we'll start on the East side of the central prospect and work our way to the West before you get up, as you pointed out, before you get to the Central Basin platform.\nCharles Meade: Guys that's good detail. Kaes, when I was listening if you answered, maybe think of a word, I don't think you've ever heard before. I was expecting you say something like that Western side is underwritten or something like that. But anyway, on underwritten, and then maybe just one more following up on this, FireBird deal and Travis in case. I think this is kind of whether we should think about this as a new mode or a pattern for you guys. As I look at the different pieces of your business where you're not committing to 75% cash return -- free cash return to shareholders. That leaves a smaller piece, the 25% piece available to fund the cash portion of any future A&D. And then we look at the FireBird deal, you guys -- it was -- it looks like a good deal. But equity was a big component of it. So is that something we should be thinking about for you guys? Is that as you're retaining less cash and equity is going to be a meaningful chunk of future A&D, or is the -- is that the wrong iteration?\nKaes Van't Hof: Well, I think generally, there's not a ton of A&D left to do in the basin, right? It certainly -- there's not random 200,000, 30,000 acre blocks in the middle of Martin County or Midland County that are available. So A&D is certainly evolving over the next couple of years in the Permian as consolidation continues. I think generally, with the 75-25 commitment to equity versus non-equity on cash returns that makes looking at deals even more -- put deals under the microscope, right? So in this deal, we're very focused on not levering up the balance sheet in a meaningful way because we work so hard to get the balance sheet where it is. And the sellers had an asset that was early in its development and believed in the upside and wanted to take Diamondback's stock to execute on that upside. It's not -- we're not giving up 10% of the company to these guys. They have a 3% position and hopefully, they're long-term happy shareholders. But I think we've used equity to grow this business for the last 10 years. And it's proven out to be the right way to fund deals.\nCharles Meade: Thanks for that details, Kaes. Appreciate it.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with MKM Partners.\nLeo Mariani: Hi, guys. I wanted to jump back into kind of CapEx. Certainly, I noticed that CapEx has kind of been trending up a little bit in the last few quarters and into the fourth quarter guidance. I assume that's mainly inflation. I think your activity levels have been pretty flattish. Can you just provide any more color around the pace of inflation right now? I know you talked about tubulars continuing to sort of go up? Are you starting to sense that any other items are maybe starting to ease a little bit where they're not rising as quickly, and have you locked in any major portions of your 2023 budget at this point? And if so, can you provide some details on that?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Leo, good question. I would say this is, kind of, why we're not looking to give 2023 guidance officially today because I think some things will come to us versus this year where everything just went up. We do have a couple of frac fleets locked in and the two fleets that we talked about. All of our sand is locked in with a large contract with a local provider. You know, the rigs, we continue to roll our rigs on a rolling 6-month basis. And while we're running 15 rigs today, I bet you 12 of them are different rigs that we're running this time next -- this time last year because of cost and efficiencies. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes to keep pushing well costs down or stopped them from going up, and that's what you'd expect us to do.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And I just wanted to ask a clarification question. I know it's too early for exact specifics on 2023. But if I heard you guys right, I mean, the base level thinking is, sort of, flattish year-over-year activity and then basically would just add in -- in FireBird, essentially. So the operated plan for this year, FireBird is relatively intact for next year?\nKaes Van't Hof: That's right. I think FireBird, we're going to drop a couple of rigs drop them down from three rigs to one rig, generate a little more free cash on that business and hit 19,000 net barrels a day of production. We forecasted for that business. I think we'll complete around 30 wells there. So you can basically take Diamondback base business from this year plus the 30 wells from FireBird plus the production that we laid out today to get an early look at 2023.\nLeo Mariani: Okay, Thanks, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Leo.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to CEO, Travis Stice, for any closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again for everyone to participate in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the information provided.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yeah, Neal, good question. This is Kaes. I think generally, we obviously had a tough earnings call at the end of 2019, when we made this shift to co-development. I think we learned very, very quickly from that as well as moving more of our capital to the Midland Basin. And I think just generally, the teams have done a really good job on not only spacing within each zone, but the intra-zonal spacing given that these zones talk to each other. And the result is better overall assets here over the last couple of years. So nothing is going to change there. I think we're going to keep co-developing. And in fact, in some ways, we'll end up doing some larger pads, and we even have prior given the amount of virgin rock we have in that sale of Robertson Ranch area that is kicking off in a real way right now. I think generally \u2013 on the other \u2013 on the other question, well costs are certainly the biggest advantage we have as a company at Diamondback, and that's a cultural thing from top to bottom. We're very focused on cost, very focused on keeping costs down in this inflationary environment. I think that gives us an advantage, particularly in looking at stuff like FireBird, right? FireBird we're going to co-develop a lot of zones up in the north at a low cost structure and that central position. There's opportunities for upside, if we bring the Wolfcamp B into the Lower Spraberry development. And that, I think the testament that we can drill them cheap, the returns make sense to compete for capital. Yeah. And then no change to the 35% of free cash flow, while it's certainly a restrictive amount of cash to be giving back to the equity holders, we feel that our balance sheet is in a position to be able to do that. And we're still going to reduce debt through non-core asset sales or free cash flow generation and our debt structure is significantly better than it has probably ever been in our company history. So generally, we feel that, it's time for our equity holders to get their cash back after this company has matured from a high-growth company to a high-returning company. Thanks, Neal. Yes. Good question, Neil. I think while we're not ready to throw in the towel that well costs are going to keep going up next year, we do have some things coming our way from an efficiency perspective. But I'll kind of lay it out two ways. Based on the $1.9 billion that Diamondback is going to spend on capital this year, pre FireBird. I would assume we're probably up 10% to 15% from that number gone ahead if we had to make that decision today on well costs. I think another way to think about it is basically in Diamondback today is pre-FireBird at a $500 million run rate of capital, I would say, somewhere below 10% increase off of that makes sense. And then in both scenarios, adding the $250 million of CapEx for FireBird, we ran that deal on current well costs. So those current well costs are running through that the capital free cash flow numbers that we put in for that deal. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think certainly, there are some things that could go our way. Casing has been a massive headwind for us and for the industry. Midland Basin, casing is now $110 a foot, that is a huge number of -- on a fixed cost that we can't really control here. Yeah, Arun, I'll focus more on what Diamondback is doing. We certainly do a lot of competitor analysis and learn a lot from our competitors on what to do and what not to do in the basin. So generally, we have a data analytics team that looks at inter-lateral and reserve spacing, and how many wells are completing per pad and per zone and how close the nearest well bore is. And our math tells us that we're finding a striking a good balance here between IRR and NPV. We may not have the highest oil per foot, but certainly spacing wells a little tighter, as well as co-developing more economic zones together and I expect that trend to continue to head our way. In some ways, these higher commodity prices bring more zones into the equation and maybe even one or two wells per zone. But generally, spacing has stayed fairly consistent here for the last couple of years. So credit to the team for looking at what we've done, what's gone well, what's gone poorly and adjusting accordingly. And I think we're set up now for a few years of very solid development, particularly in the Midland Basin side. Yeah. I mean, certainly, when we go back to that deal, we basically said we did these two deals to get better and not bigger. And I think that's proving out in the performance of the wells and the performance since then. We're just getting started in the main block. There's probably a 24-well pad coming on here in early 2023, and we'll continue to develop that sale in Robertson block very aggressively with probably a three-rig run rate until it's drilled up in three or four years. And that should drive the lion's share of operational performance. Not to be outdone by that, though, we have seen very good well results up in the Northwest portion of Martin County this year due to some adjustments on spacing and landing targets, and I'm proud to say certainly some of the shallower zones, Middle Spraberry has looked very, very good up there relative to prior expectations. Yeah. I mean, basically, next year, two-third of our gas goes to Waha, and that's all been hedged today, actually hedged a while back. And the other third gets Gulf Coast exposure on the Whistler pipeline. And then as you think about 2024, we think there's going to be pockets of weakness in 2024, certainly easing in the back half of the year when the big pipe Matterhorn comes on, but it's going to be tight from now until then, because some of these expansions, yeah, there are 500 million a day expansion, but I think they're going to be full right away. Yeah, a good question. I think the biggest thing that's going to help us next year from a cost perspective are the two Halliburton e-fleets that one has just started and one is picking up. I think generally, on the horsepower side, we get charged a little bit less. They make more margin on that particular piece of business. On top of that, we're not spending money on diesel, right? So we're fueling that fleet with cheap Waha gas for the next couple of years, and that could be anywhere from $10 to $15 a foot of savings depending on what the price of Waha is. And we just opened our first mobile mine or mini mine that's going to be right offset some of our Martin County position. So I think generally, while we're not drilling wells to TD faster than we were last year, we're still best in class in that area. Now, it's time to work on the other pieces of the cost equation as inflation heats up here. Yeah. I mean really, David, it's all value, right? But generally, internally, we see that an E&P business trades at 4, 5 times and a pipeline or a gathering system trades at 8 to 10 times. So it's logical for us, with us not getting any credit for it in our valuation to look at some of the JVs that we invested in alongside contributing volumes to those businesses over the last five years. And now, I think they're in kind of a harvest mode where it might make sense to sell, particularly given our buying of Rattler and renewed focus on the upstream business, which is what we're so good at. So, I won't commit to certain projects, but there are certainly some of our JVs were sitting on big wins, and you could expect us to try to monetize those appropriately over time. Yes. I mean I think it's going to be around for a while, certainly longer than the market can see today, which I think is important, right? We have two well-timed deals in 2020 that that we're benefiting from today. I think generally, our job is to allocate capital to the best returning zones and projects first. So, we won't be able to keep this up forever. But I think as the shale cost curve goes up, which is likely to happen over the next decade, our job is to maintain a cost structure and an inventory that keeps us at the low end of that cost curve. And that's what we've built this business on. And I think we have both the inventory and definitely the cost structure to be able to keep ourselves at the low end of that cost curve longer. Thanks, David. Good morning, Jeoffrey. Yes, Jeoff great question. When we announced the deal, we got one with a lot of people, but we haven't been on a big call like this. We basically said the northern prospect, which you can see on slide 8 in our deck, competes for capital right away, and that's the game plan is to allocate that rig to that northern prospect for the first few years of the deal. I think generally, recent well results in the Central prospect would bring in the Wolfcamp A upside into co-development. We underwrote six across in the Lower Spraberry across that block, and that's what we paid for. But, recent well results of co-developing the LSE looked pretty promising today. We have some time to kind of test that out before full field development, but that's kind of the underwritten upside of the trade. Good morning, Jeanine. Yes. Jeanine, I won't say it interrupts operational momentum into next year because it's our job to not have those issues. We are running a couple of extra intermediate rigs today to get ahead of these large pads where the big rig follows. So I think the message is nothing to see here from operational momentum. That's what you expect us to do, and that's what we do best. Just -- I would just say, we probably completed a couple of more wells in the Delaware than we originally expected this year, and we ran probably one less rig than we thought for the year. So -- on the other side of the equation, we're completing probably 15 less wells than we went into the year expected to complete. So your capital efficiency is certainly looking good and momentum feels very good going into 2023. Yes. Good question. I think we did release 19,000 barrels of oil a day net for FireBird in 2023 and that is not changing. The base business FANG, we went into 2022 saying we're going to keep 220,000 barrels of oil a day flat. We've kind of outperformed that a little bit this year. But basically, you can take that 220, complete the same number of wells as we expected at the pre FireBird Diamondback level, and that should spit out a couple of percentage points of low single-digit growth. And then add that FireBird 19 on top of that, and nothing's changed here from our perspective. You think that what you expect us to do, be transparent and hit these numbers. Thank you, Jeanine. Honestly, quite frankly, we look at all our inventory of keep that 80-20 steady for a long time. So I don't think there's any plans to change it. In some ways, with the FireBird acquisition, some more wells completed there will probably be closer to 85-15 Midland, Delaware. And I think the curves that we posted on slide 7 proved out that our Midland Basin is certainly top notch, and that's where we're going to be focused. I think generally, we have a significant amount of long lateral development ahead of us. At some point, naturally, if we can't get trades done block up acreage, we're going to have to reduce our lateral lengths. But I think on the other hand, you have a lower decline production allowing you to maintain capital efficiency for a longer period of time. So we look at it every quarter, total inventory, total development. And as far as we can see, things look very good for Diamondback's capital efficiency for the next few years. Thank you, John. Yeah, good question. I don't think it's anything in the near-term. There certainly are some results further West that early time look promising. We didn't underwrite kind of two-mile buffer on the West side for LS prospectivity, but certainly did -- there's certainly some untapped upside with some Barnett and Woodford results nearby, including our Limelight prospects. So that play is getting a lot of attention. But at the end of the day, our investors expect us to underwrite what we're going to develop. And right now, that's all on unvalued upside, which technology and costs work out, it will be certainly prospective into the next decade when we get to drilling it. Well, I think generally, there's not a ton of A&D left to do in the basin, right? It certainly -- there's not random 200,000, 30,000 acre blocks in the middle of Martin County or Midland County that are available. So A&D is certainly evolving over the next couple of years in the Permian as consolidation continues. I think generally, with the 75-25 commitment to equity versus non-equity on cash returns that makes looking at deals even more -- put deals under the microscope, right? So in this deal, we're very focused on not levering up the balance sheet in a meaningful way because we work so hard to get the balance sheet where it is. And the sellers had an asset that was early in its development and believed in the upside and wanted to take Diamondback's stock to execute on that upside. It's not -- we're not giving up 10% of the company to these guys. They have a 3% position and hopefully, they're long-term happy shareholders. But I think we've used equity to grow this business for the last 10 years. And it's proven out to be the right way to fund deals. Thanks, Charles. Yes, Leo, good question. I would say this is, kind of, why we're not looking to give 2023 guidance officially today because I think some things will come to us versus this year where everything just went up. We do have a couple of frac fleets locked in and the two fleets that we talked about. All of our sand is locked in with a large contract with a local provider. You know, the rigs, we continue to roll our rigs on a rolling 6-month basis. And while we're running 15 rigs today, I bet you 12 of them are different rigs that we're running this time next -- this time last year because of cost and efficiencies. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes to keep pushing well costs down or stopped them from going up, and that's what you'd expect us to do. That's right. I think FireBird, we're going to drop a couple of rigs drop them down from three rigs to one rig, generate a little more free cash on that business and hit 19,000 net barrels a day of production. We forecasted for that business. I think we'll complete around 30 wells there. So you can basically take Diamondback base business from this year plus the 30 wells from FireBird plus the production that we laid out today to get an early look at 2023. Thanks, Leo."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. And before we start with my prepared remarks this morning, I want to encourage each of you to please take advantage of one of our greatest privileges we have as Americans, our freedom to elect our representatives. Please take the time off your busy schedules today to go vote, if you've not already done so. Welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. A Diamondback, we pride ourselves on our execution. Our commitment to being the lowest cost operator in the Permian Basin has and will continue to position us for success through the cycle. The third quarter was no exception. In the quarter, we produced over 224,000 barrels of oil per day and generated approximately $1.7 billion in operating cash flow. Our CapEx was once again within our guidance range, leading to free cash flow of nearly $1.2 billion. As we previously announced, we increased our return of capital commitment and stated that beginning this quarter, we would return at least 75% of free cash flow back to our shareholders, up from at least 50% previously. At 75%, total capital return was nearly $875 million, with dividends totaling $403 million or $2.26 per share. The remaining $472 million went towards our opportunistic share repurchase program, where we bought back nearly 4 million shares at an average price of approximately $120 a share. To date, we've spent approximately $1.2 billion of our $4 billion buyback authorization, repurchasing nearly 6% of our shares outstanding since September of last year when we initiated our program. In October, we announced the pending acquisition of the assets of FireBird Energy, a company with a large, contiguous position in the Midland Basin. We feel FireBird has right balance of cash flow and inventory and the acquisition is immediately accretive on all relevant per share financial metrics while providing a long runway of high-quality drilling opportunities. With over 350 locations, we expect to have well over a decade of run room at our projected one-rig development phase. In conjunction with the acquisition, we announced that we would sell at least $500 million of non-core assets by the year-end 2023, with net proceeds primarily used to pay down debt. Since then, we closed on a $155 million sale of non-core assets in the Delaware Basin, jump-starting our program and ensuring continuous improvement to our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to pursue strategic divestitures, including the sale of certain assets within our Rattler portfolio, generating unrealized value for our shareholders. In closing, we know our business. We know we have some of the best inventory in the United States with our low-cost operational machine in place. We have the unique ability to generate significant repeatable returns through the drill bit for decades to come. In 2019, we began co-developing our primary targets. Since then, we've learned how to optimize our development patterns and spacing, and as a result, are seeing material improvement in well productivity over the past 36 months. In fact, our well performance this year is back at 2019 levels, when we were primarily targeting one-off wells in our -- zones, which while having great performance and economics and the potential to withstand significant components of our inventory, leading to material parent-child concerns down the line. Fortunately, we are well positioned for the future. We expect to close on the FireBird transaction at the end of November and slow the development pace on that asset from three rigs to one. We are working with our service providers to ensure that we have the most efficient and cost-effective personnel and equipment in place for next year, including the two e-fleet simul-frac crews we've secured from Halliburton, the first of which is already in the field and performing well. All of this will provide operational momentum as we move into 2023 we expect to deliver the same operational results you've come to expect from Diamondback. While we won't be giving detailed for the 2023 guidance today, we believe that we'll be able to generate low single-digit pro forma oil production growth next year by maintaining our current standalone activity levels plus the one additional FireBird rig. It's not easy to operate in this environment, but our size, scale and quality of the inventory uniquely position us to deliver differentiated results and create meaningful value for our shareholders. Before I open up for questions, I want to address all the Diamondback employees that are on the phone. At Diamondback, we've just celebrated our 10 years as a public company, growing from a $500 million market cap to almost $30 billion today. The people around me this morning and sometimes me individual get too much credit for the success. It's you, the men and women of Diamondback that deserve the credit. It's your pursuit of excellence, your desire to be the very best version of yourself, your dedication to integrity that is responsible for our success. It remains my privilege to represent you. Thank you for all that you do. Operator, please open the line for questions. Look, we've seen the volatility in the market that every quarter, we've had the opportunity to buy shares back. And when that opportunity presents itself, we'll do so aggressively. I think the key to any of those questions is the ability to generate free cash flow. And that's certainly what our focus is, and then maintaining the flexibility on how the return of that free cash flow gets prosecuted. I will say that in conversations with our long-only shareholders. A lot of those guys prefer to get the cash back. But again, we believe that we'll have opportunities to repurchase shares back. A lot to unpack in that question, Neal, but I think it's really all of the above. I think there is asset maturation. I think certainly, supply chain constraints are also limiting growth. I think for public companies, the continued discipline that we've all been demonstrating on shareholder returns versus a commitment to growth. I think all of those factors weigh into more of a muted production growth from US shale going forward. That said, out here in the Permian, I think we're still continuing to hit production records every month, somewhere close to 5.3 million to 5.5 million barrels a day. But that's going to be challenged to continue to grow that into the future. Do we have the assets out here? Yes, we do. But some of those other topical constraints that I mentioned are going to be impediments to efficient growth assume we'll probably see at higher commodity prices some people try to grow, but they're allocating capital if they're very trailing into of efficiency. So those also create headwinds as well for shareholders. Hey, good morning Derrick. Yeah. Certainly, it's going to be tight. I'll let Kaes give some specifics on that. But I think gas takeaway is going to be talked really certainly most of next year, probably well into 2024 as well until we get some of the major pipes on. So we do think \u2013 we do opportunistic hedging, particularly against the \u2013 on the Waha side. And we've committed to some of these pipes that are help making sure we get gas not only that doesn't go to Waha, but goes directly to the Gulf Coast. Yeah. And Derrick, there's a lot of conversations always when you see activity levels increase in the Permian Basin about the impacts of the inexperienced or green hands, we call them. But I don't follow that line of thinking, because it's our job as supervisors of those activities to make sure that even the least experienced individual has the right supervision to perform this job not only safely, but efficiently. So they almost actually transfers not to the service companies, within experienced hands, it transfers to our operations organization and our field supervisors to make sure they can provide the oversight to prosecute our plans effectively, efficiently and safely. Thank you, Derrick. You're welcome, David. Good morning. Thank you Jeof, Yes, certainly not specifically inside Diamondback. But yes, aggressively so with the trade organizations that Diamondback is a part of. At the federal level, API, APC we have a lot of sweat equity invested in both of those trade organizations that we lean in alongside all of our industry peers to provide some clear strategies into the White House and the current administration. So \u2013 and that will continue regardless of how the results of the elections turn out today. That's our advocacy arm, and we think it's important for our shareholders to be a dynamic part of that advocacy. Yeah, it certainly seems like the rhetoric has turned decidedly against the industry again in the lead up to these elections. We can only open pray for that our citizens continue to elect morally and ethically excellent representatives, so that we can send people to Washington, D.C. that do a will of the people. And Diamondback is going to continue to do our part like I said, through advocacy, both locally and at the state and federal level as we navigate this very difficult rhetoric that's being addressed or pointed at our industry. You bet. Thanks, Tim. Hey, John. Thanks John. Hi. Good morning, Charles. And you'll see our development strategy, Charles, as we've moved to that central block, as Kaes laid out as kind of our Phase 2 drilling, but we'll start East and work West. And I think the two wells that are labeled E and F on slide 8 are good examples of what that early development scenario look like. While we didn't complete those wells, the results are really promising. And we're excited about them. But Phase 1 will be up to the North, which is very akin to our Spanish Trail development, and then we'll start on the East side of the central prospect and work our way to the West before you get up, as you pointed out, before you get to the Central Basin platform. Thank you again for everyone to participate in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the information provided."

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter '22 Conference Call. During our call, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements related to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.  In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.  I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by highlighting our second quarter performance. We once again delivered operationally, producing over 221,000 barrels of oil per day, near the high end of our quarterly guidance range. Our discretionary cash flow or operating cash flow before working capital changes totaled $1.8 billion, up 27% quarter-over-quarter, setting a new high for the company. This increase was primarily due to a favorable backdrop -- macro backdrop as well as improvement to our realized pricing as hedges put on last year continue to roll off. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 35% quarter-over-quarter. We will return 63% of this free cash flow to our shareholders, well in excess of our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow. This return is made up of our growing and sustainable base dividend, opportunistic share repurchases and a robust variable dividend.  Our annual base dividend is now $3 per share or $0.75 per quarter, representing a 7.1% increase from the company's previous annual base dividend of $2.80 per share or $0.70 per quarter. As previously announced, the Board elected to keep our total dividend per share flat quarter-over-quarter at $3.05, which is comprised of the 75% base dividend and a $2.30 variable dividend. This puts our total annualized 2Q dividend yield of nearly 10%. Additionally, we took advantage of market volatility and repurchased nearly 2.4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of a little over $127 a share for a total cost of approximately $303 million. We believe our opportunistic, disciplined approach to our repurchase program brings the most value forward for our shareholders and continues to give us the flexibility to use either our variable dividend, buybacks, or as has been the case so far in 2022, a combination of both to hit or exceed our returns target. As we move into the second half of the year, it's hard to ignore the amount of free cash flow we expect to generate, around $2.5 billion of current strip pricing. In June, we announced an increase in our capital returns commitment target, moving it up from 50% to at least 75% of free cash flow beginning in the third quarter. At 75%, that's over $1.8 billion return to shareholders or well north of $10 per share in just 2 quarters, for a total annualized return yield of approximately 17%.  This robust free cash flow profile led the Board to double the size of our buyback program from $2 billion to $4 billion, giving us ample running room to be opportunistic in the equity markets. Since the program was initiated in the third quarter of last year, we've repurchased over 8.3 million shares at an average price of $113 a share for a total cost of approximately $940 million. This includes 1.8 million of shares we've already repurchased in the third quarter for a total of $200 million at an average price of $113.70 a share. Our confidence to increase our return through payout is rooted in the strength of our balance sheet. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $337 million in Diamondback senior notes at an average cost of 95.4% of par for a total of $322 million. We focused on our debt coming due over the next 10 years, significantly lowering our maturity towers, while taking advantage of the volatile debt market.  We also recently redeemed $45 million in legacy Energen and QEP notes due 2022 at par. As a result, our balance sheet is stronger today than ever before. Our annualized net debt-to-EBITDA is under 0.7x, and we continue to improve our leverage profile with net debt decreasing by $267 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter. These debt reduction efforts have helped decrease our interest expense by 25% year-over-year, offsetting higher production taxes and lifting costs and helping push our unhedged realized cash margin this quarter to more than 83%, a company record.  Moving to the operations side of the business. The environment in the Permian continues to be challenged. However, we continue to focus on how we can mitigate the inflationary pressures we're seeing across nearly all facets of the business by lowering the variable pieces of our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to keep the high end of our capital guidance range flat at $1.9 billion. We do not anticipate any future changes. Yet we still haven't been able to offset all of the fixed pricing increases we've seen, which is why we've moved up our third quarter capital range to $470 million to $510 million, up from our capital spend of $468 million this quarter. This takes into account the roughly 10% cost increase we expect on the frac side, which is made up of increases in the cost of horsepower, wireline services and fuel.  On the drilling side of the business, we're seeing a similar level of pricing increases, particularly from day rates, casing and cement. In the back half of this year, we plan to operate approximately 12 drilling rigs and 3 frac crews. As we mentioned last quarter, we've partnered with Halliburton to secure our first e-fleet frac crew, which will run in our Martin County acreage off power generated from a central location and delivered via existing lines, not only reducing our Scope 1 emissions profile, but also lowering our completion costs as a result of fuel savings and improved operational efficiency.  We expect this fleet to be operational early in the fourth quarter and it will simply be swapped in for 1 of our existing Halliburton crews. Earlier this month, we continue to lean into this technology and secured our second e-fleet crew. This crew will be operational in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to further reduce costs and decrease our environmental footprint. It will also replace 1 of our existing crews.  On the drilling side, we currently have 1 drilling rig running offline power in the Delaware Basin with 2 more electric rigs expected in 2023. Just as we're seeing on the completion side, the electrification of our drilling fleet has multiple benefits. Additionally, we're utilizing sputter and intermediate rigs to take advantage of lower pricing as compared to the rest of our drilling fleet, and are exploring downsize and surface casing size, intermediate hole size to improve our drilling efficiencies, pushing Diamondback even further down the cost curve.  Lastly, we continue to work to earn our social and environmental license to operate. Part of this is our commitment to provide quarterly disclosures that detail our progress towards our environmental goals. We are proud of how we have performed so far this year when looking at multiple metrics, including recycling nearly 40% of our produced water and keeping our total recordable incident level at multiyear lows. However, flaring continues to be an issue. We are diligently working with our gathering partners to build in redundancy, accelerate plant turnarounds and meet the takeaway needs of our current development plan. We remain committed to ending routine flaring by 2025 and are confident in our ability to achieve that goal.  We've also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to lower our emissions profile by building pipelines and electrifying our production fields. These projects have lowered our costs to date, but due to the increase in the cost of power across the state of Texas, we have had to move our lease operating expense guidance range up by $0.50 a barrel at $4.50 to $5 a barrel. Even with this move, we continue to be the low-cost Permian operator and build on a long track record of cost control.  The second quarter was a record quarter for the company. We delivered on our production guidance, kept costs in line and distributed over 63% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We are well positioned to build off this momentum and are excited to begin returning at least 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders this quarter. We expect this industry-leading cash returns program and our best-in-class operational machine to continue to deliver differentiated results for our shareholders.  With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist.\nNeal Dingmann: My first question is somewhat on shareholder returns. Specifically, I think on your conference call a year ago looked and, Travis, I think you stated that as you looked at back then at supply and demand fundamentals. You said, I think, suggest that oil supply was still purposely been withheld in the market, driving your call to not grow production. So I'm wondering when you look at today, do you still believe that's the overall case of worldwide fundamentals or specifically supply? And does that still drive -- is that still your primary decision -- your primary driver of your decision for the no growth? Or is this more based on investor request?\nTravis Stice: Well, certainly, as we look into 2023, I think it's a little premature to do much forecasting into 2023. But I can tell you kind of our base case is looking at something at the same activity level, probably generating something in the low single digits in terms of the growth rate. But again, it's more of an output.  But I think what you specifically asked about the call last year, I think I highlighted really 3 things and then subsequently added a fourth, and that was demand at pre-COVID levels. We wanted to see 5-year inventory levels somewhere returning to the 5-year average. We still had a question about OPEC capacity. And the one I added subsequent to our call was the administration continuing to embark uncertainty into our capital allocation process across the industry.  And so certainly 3 of the 4 of those have been answered today, Neal. There's still a lot of administration led uncertainty, both in policy actions and rhetoric. But the other ones certainly appear to be answered. So I think as the industry starts to contribute towards more focus on 2023, I think you'll still be governed primarily by the shareholders who own the companies. But I do think you'll start to see a little bit of growth in the industry as we look into next year.\nNeal Dingmann: Great. Great response. Then my second question really, I would say is on the notable capital spend discipline that you guys continue to have. As many others we've already heard about, continue to increase their cost despite them previously saying that they were locked in. So I'm just wondering, going forward, would you all consider any type of, I don't know, like a more vertical integration or any other new strategy, will the focus remain more or less on the same as working with vendors and just the efficient execution?\nTravis Stice: Well, Neal, I think we've been pretty successful with the existing model. We'll always look at seeing what ways we can ensure lower execution cost. We were a little bit plummet in the first quarter with all the commentary about locked in prices and then subsequently followed with CapEx raises. And that's just not the way that we typically try to communicate what our execution focus is.  But I do want to -- I don't know I have a lot of employees listening in the call this morning. And look, I want to give a shout out to our organization for our ability to continue to manage costs in an inflationary environment. Again, about a year ago, Neal, we were talking about how you separate winners and losers in an inflationary environment. It's always those that can control costs. And while we've taken our look on the fixed cost side of an AP ledger, we've done a really remarkable job on the variable cost, and I look for our organization to continue to lean into that in 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: First question is around capital returns. And you did increase the share repurchase authorization to $4 billion from $2 billion previously. It looks like you've been leaning a little bit more into the repurchase with the pullback in the stock. So if you just talk about your framework around variable dividend versus repurchases? And how you're thinking about being countercyclical with how you deploy your share repurchases?\nTravis Stice: Well, we certainly think that there's a lot of value in our existing stock price. And we think that, that oil and public equity stocks is really undervalued right now. And so the 2 data points that you mentioned, I think, are good indicators of future behaviors. The first being, we spent about $500 million in the last 2 to 3 months repurchasing shares. And the Board just essentially doubled our authorization up to $4 billion. So the base dividend still remains sacred, sustainable and growing followed by this environment share repurchases. And then as we committed to a month ago, we'll make up the difference and keep our shareholders hold by returning at least 75% of free cash flow.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. And then would love your perspective on the M&A outlook. We know that you've been active over the last couple of years. But is it fair to assume that given that you're prioritizing share repurchases at this point, do you think that's a better investment than third-party M&A?\nTravis Stice: Yes, certainly, Neil, that's the behavior we're demonstrating in. As I just iterated, just to emphasize all in the public markets is really cheaper in the private markets, and I think there continues to be a wide gap between those 2 points. And I think you're also seeing stalled or failed processes as well, which again indicates a spread between bid and ask. So right now, the greatest return for our shareholders is leaning into our repurchase program.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Securities.\nArun Jayaram: Maybe just a follow-up to Neil's question, is how do you think about your process to engage in portfolio renewal in this kind of backdrop and perhaps a little bit more color, it looks like you had about $85 million of property acquisitions in the cash flow statement. I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of detail on that? And I think on a year-to-date basis, that takes you just under $400 million of property acquisitions.\nTravis Stice: Yes. Arun, the big deal is obviously in Q1, $230 million deal. We do capitalize a little G&A and interest which flows through that number, so it's not all property acquisitions. But a couple of things that we do on the property side, it's just the typical blocking and tackling, netting up. We give our land teams the directive that we'd rather drill 100% working interest wells across the board. And so they're always working to net up and block and tackle, but nothing of significance purchased in Q2.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: And look around being having boots on the ground here in Midland, I think all of our shareholders expect me and us to be in the deal flow at all times. But that just means we look at things coming across the desk, but I go back to say, look at what our behaviors are and the separation between public and private expectations on value. And that's -- I think that's the best way to think about what our forward plans are.\nArun Jayaram: Okay. And just my follow-up is, you guys had really, really strong oil price realizations in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just remind us about your mix between getting waterborne crude pricing versus, call it, a Midland type of benchmark?\nTravis Stice: Yes. So we have all of our oil on pipes going to the Gulf Coast. A 1/3 of it going to Houston, getting MEH pricing, 2/3 going to Corpus getting Brent pricing. And so we've been the beneficiary of these water Brent WTI spread. We have a little bit of exposure to the Midland market, we also have the ability to kind of flex that to the Gulf Coast with the space that we have. And so the sell-off in WTI versus Brent has resulted in really good oil realizations. No guarantees that it's going to continue forever. But that kind of fits the insurance policy that we put in place to invest in these pipelines and get our barrels to the most liquid markets.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Hanold: Could you all give us some view on what you all are seeing on leading edge inflation? And if you can give us a sense of what kind of savings you guys expect from the e-fracs versus a regular frac crew? I mean, how meaningful is that?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Scott, good question. I would say, generally, we took up CapEx on the low end and took up our average well cost estimate for the year. I would say probably today, we're probably up 15% today from the beginning of the year. We'll probably exit a little higher than that. So probably 15% year-over-year well cost increases, but what the ops team is doing is not taking every phone call and just increasing prices. We're trying to do some things to be more efficient. You mentioned the e-fleet, Travis just mentioned in his opening remarks that we're going to have a second e-fleet coming in early next year. That saves money, not just on the horsepower piece, but on the fuel piece. These will be connected to line power and the back end of a gas plant with burning dry gas in the Permian.  So while gas prices have gone up, they certainly haven't gone up as much as diesel. I would say we'd probably save 50-ish a foot with that -- $50 a foot with that e-fleet. A couple of other things we are doing on top of that, we are adding some preset rigs to replace some big rigs as those preset rigs cost a lot less with these big pads and long cycle investments. We have that ability to do so. Our team is also getting really smart on casing design, cement design, wherever we can pick up pennies that's just our stock in trade.\nScott Hanold: A lot of pennies there you're picking up. Good to hear that. And as a follow-up, and I'm going to kind of belabor the point on shareholder returns. And I know you all have done pretty well with executing your flexible plan. But the bottom line is right now, it appears that your stock is trading at a discount to peers. I mean it looks pretty evident. And like how do you all think about like what the best way to bridge that gap is? And like what can you do to kind of force the issue to get your valuation more in line with peers or where you think it should be?\nTravis Stice: Scott, when I talk to our Board and communicate what I think the success indicators are, there's really five. Three of them were foundational that led us to success in the first 10 years. And I think the two that I've added are going to be foundational for the next 10 years. But the three that we built the company on our execution, low-cost operations and transparency. And we've been very successful at differentiating ourselves with those. The two that have recently been added are capital return and decarbonization. And on the capital return, we're now -- our yield is peer-leading. We're competitive on all forms of shareholder return measures. And the last one is decarbonization, and not only in our disclosure, but also in our performance.  And look, those are the five things that we'd sell at. And you can ask us questions about any one of those five, we can articulate chapter verse why those are successful -- why we're successful with those. And while you pointed out a dislocation in stock, we believe fundamentally that we continue to do the right thing for our shareholders to generate the greatest value. And it -- and we believe we're running this company not just for a quarter but for the next 10 years and longer.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate the color today. Maybe if I could ask one on just CapEx. In 2022, I think you all forecasted about 12% of your total budget going towards non-D&C. Is that a good contribution as we think about '23 and '24?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Good question, David. I think generally, if you look at our past history, we kind of whenever a deal happens the next year, infrastructure and midstream is 10% to 15%, getting down to kind of 7% to 8% of total capital in that years. I certainly expect us to be closer to 7% to 8% of total capital in 2024 with a step-down next year in 2023. I think the only wrinkle is we are all us and our peers are all spending a lot of money on environmental cleanup. And so that's probably $30 million to $40 extra million a year that wasn't in the budget in 2017 or 2018. It's necessary dollars, but generally, I'd expect our midstream infrastructure budgets to come down next year and into '24, probably a step change down to 7% or 8% in a couple of years.\nDavid Deckelbaum: And then maybe just as a follow-up. Obviously, the 3Q CapEx, 4Q CapEx is going to be -- is going to follow with activity with 3Q being higher than 4Q. As we think about next year, though, I think the expectation is that you guys would still be in that sort of 270, 290 wells, 12 rigs, a few frac crews. Is that $460 million or so implied guide for 4Q? Is that $460 million to $500 million range, like a reasonable run rate to think about '23? Or are there explicit reasons why you would want us to be guided away from that?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I mean I think it's just too early to talk '23 inflation. I'm certainly kind of in the camp that we're not willing to continue to concede margin expansion on the service side perpetually. So we're going to see where things shake out over the next 6 months. Like we said earlier in the call, there are some things we are doing to increase efficiencies and lower costs. I would just say, generally, I think you're right on activity going into 2023. I can't -- I'm not going to comment yet on some respects and where things head particularly with some of the stuff that's out of our control like steel continuing to go up in price.\nDavid Deckelbaum: The only inflation I'm making then there's CapEx per share.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Whitfield from Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield: Congrats on your quarter end update. With my first question, I wanted to focus on your operational efficiency. Would it be safe to assume the improvement you experienced in your drilling and completion efficiency metrics over the last couple of years has at least plateaued as a result of service tightness and the dilution of experienced crews?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Derrick, I think that's a fair statement. Certainly, the business has gotten a lot harder to operate and execute this year. It's on us though to make sure we have the right supervision in the field to make sure green hands are trained up quickly. It's something that we are seeing. We do spend a lot of money near the wellhead to make sure our supervision oversees what's going on in the field.  But then there's a couple of other things that kind of go the other way, right? So the spud rigs that we're putting in place, they drill a little slower, but they cost half as much as the big rigs. So I think generally, we kind of hit the efficient frontier on days of TD this year, but now we're doing some things that might slow things down, but spend less money per well.\nDerrick Whitfield: That makes complete sense. And as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on the Inflation Reduction Act, which could be voted on this week focusing on the minimum tax and methane fee components. Could you speak to the implications for Diamondback and the industry in general? It seems at a minimum from our perspective that the one rare case that gets Diamondback would be minimized with the 15% minimum tax stipulation.\nTravis Stice: Derrick, the methane fee tax is one thing that we've looked at. And because of the dollars we've spent over the last 3 years really reducing our methane emissions that doesn't appear as we understand it to be a needle mover for Diamondback.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. And then on the tax side, we're pretty low on NOL protection. So if the strip holds, we have about $1 billion of protection next year, we would be above the 15% minimum that's being proposed. So I think generally moving towards a full taxpaying entity at Diamondback which mitigates the impact to us. Certainly, if we're in a different commodity price environment, it might be a different story. But in this environment, we're headed towards full cash taxes in 2024.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays.\nJeanine Wai: Our first question is maybe hitting on the balance sheet a little bit. So you had about $21 million of stand-alone cash at the end of the quarter, and that reflects really getting after paying off those notes early and at a very nice discount. That's great. What's the sequencing of further debt reduction that you mentioned? And do you have an updated view on your target cash balance? We're essentially kind of back in to how much potential upside there could be to exceeding the 75% minimum return?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Jeanine, good question. With the rate review we expected to close at the end of August, we'll have to pay off that revolver at close. It's about a $200 million revolver that we'll expect to pay with -- down with cash. We also want to take out the Rattler notes, $500 million notes next. There are some reporting requirements with those notes if they continue to stay out there. So I think those 2 items are certainly the priorities, and we probably expect to be in a position to have those taken out by the next time on the phone here. And then I think after that, it goes back to being selective with the other outstanding notes. You'll note that we didn't touch the 2 30-year tranches that we have out there, but we did take down some of our 29 and 31 opportunistically with a discount. But generally, the Rattler notes and Rattler revolvers coming out next and then we'll be more prudent with the rest.\nJeanine Wai: Okay. Great. And then maybe a quick one on operations. I think in the past, you mentioned running 3 simul-frac crews and then potentially utilizing a spot crew. And then in your prepared remarks, I think I heard you mention just running 3 frac crews. So just wondering if I'm remembering those 2 things correctly? And have you been able to maybe drop that spot crew due to efficiencies?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. So the 3 simul-frac crews are going to run consistently throughout the whole year. And those 3 have been going this year and they'll be the baseline for next year. We did have a spot crew running for part of Q2 -- spot crew again until probably the end of this year. We try to string together enough pads to make that spot crew cost competitive. And I don't know, Danny, you want to add anything on the spot crew?\nDaniel Wesson: No. I think the 3 simul-frac crews will do about 80% to 90% of our planned well activity and then the remaining 10% to 20%, we have to handle with an additional crew. We usually try to block it up and get a dedicated line of work for a crew for a period of time and then let it go and bring it back for the next group of wells.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nicholas Pope from Seaport Research.\nNicholas Pope: I had a quick question on kind of the updated CapEx guidance. Most -- the increase was all on the drilling side without much kind of change in kind of expected activity. But no real change in the other components, the midstream environmental infrastructure components. So I was kind of curious, are you -- what kind of inflation you're seeing on there? Are you expecting kind of the same amount of activity on those nondrilling, noncompletion components? Or is that just a little bit more fixed with project-type work?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. It's definitely a little more fixed with project-type work. There is some inflation in those budgets, but that was already somewhat baked in. On the midstream side, in particular, the big bulk items is buying a lot of pipe, and we pre-bought a lot of that. So we knew where that was going to sit on the cost side. On the infrastructure and our environmental side, it's not necessarily a change in plan. As you mentioned, it's just a few inflationary items around the edges, but it's nothing to the extent of what we're seeing on the drilling and completion side when it comes to inflation.\nNicholas Pope: Got it. I appreciate that. And as you kind of look at kind of progressing towards completion of the midstream, the Rattler kind of acquisition. Is there any anticipation of any real change in operations? Or I guess, how much kind of third-party is even a part of Rattler at this point in terms of operation?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. That's a great question, too. Nothing is going to change operationally. And we still like the midstream business. We still like what it does for our consolidated margins. We just felt that it didn't need to be a separate public entity, and so we're able to buy that back in and still run a midstream business that we own 100%. I will say the team has done a good job seeking out third-party opportunities. I wouldn't say it's our core business, but we'll have some real cash flow coming in from third parties given the amount of assets we have on the ground on the midstream side.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDoug Leggate: I hate to go back to the capital return question, but just mostly you will issue a bunch of shares. I was just wondering how we should think about split between the variable and the stepped-up buyback program as you go forward?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Doug, you were a little mixed on that. I couldn't hear you pretty well, but I think I got the gist of it. I think generally, we are going to be very aggressive on the buyback here in Q3 given where the stock is, and where we continue to generate free cash above mid-cycle prices. So already expensed $200 million quarter-to-date. Generally, if you kind of take street numbers and keep our base dividend flat in Q3, we could probably spend another $650 million on buybacks this quarter. So if the stock stays where it is and well stays where it is, we're going to be very, very aggressive on that buyback, which is why the Board signified the confidence in increasing that authorization to $4 billion.\nDoug Leggate: Okay. So sorry to press on this point, Travis, and I apologize for my line, but is there a more formulaic way we can think about -- I mean, are we still looking at a substantial variable in the second half of this year?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: None of these prices, Doug, if the stock price stays where it is today, all that cash is going to go towards reducing the share count.\nDoug Leggate: Great. That's what I was looking for. My follow-up is just a quick one on going back to the A&D very quickly. Can you clarify, as your understanding is today, do IDCs and I guess, NOL is not such a big deal for you guys, but in IDC specifically, do they still qualify as an offset to the A&D in your view? Any color you can offer in your interpretation of that?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: I think our interpretation is they still do. Unfortunately, IDCs have become such a small part of the cash flow stream that they're not impacting things much. So that's our understanding today. But you never know if politicians, anything can happen.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I wanted to ask just a follow-up on some of the thoughts around return on capital. Travis, you talked about conversations with the Board how to make Diamondback competitive relative to its peers. You've seen the evolution of what you guys had promised last year, 50% of 2022's free cash return to shareholders, the rest retiring debt. You've increased it to 75%, you just increased the buyback. I guess when you talk to the Board now about the return on capital programs, are there explicit targets that you're thinking about when you're putting on the outline around the buyback? And how did you come to this amount? Are you trying to intentionally show that Diamondback can retire 10% of its market cap plus every year? Is that -- are those explicit goals now? Or are these more coincidental based on the free cash is today?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Those are -- those -- we don't have specific goals that are articulated in the way that you just asked that question. We simply look at the value that we believe the inherent value of the stock versus where it's trading at. And we want to demonstratively move into repurchases when we think there's a big location like we see in today's market. And as we go forward in time, maybe that changes. But as it sits today, as Kaes just outlined with the previous caller, we believe that there's still a lot of value in the stock.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Vin Lovaglio from Mizuho Group.\nVincent Lovaglio: Given the scale of free cash flow generation, I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about potential investment in future offtake, particularly on the gas side and kind of connecting that gas molecule to Gulf Coast, and ultimately, hopefully, international markets?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes, Vin, good question. I think just generally, while we are a pretty significant gas producer now at this point, we don't have a lot of control over the molecule. Diamondback has grown through acquisition over the years and with those acquisitions come dedications, and most of those dedications don't come on taking kind rights. So we're certainly doing as much as we possibly can to incentivize pipeline development, getting molecules to the Gulf Coast. We did commit to the Woodford pipeline. We'll have about 1/3 of our gas on that. But generally, you have to have control of that molecule to incentivize development, and we don't have much more beyond that today.\nVincent Lovaglio: Got it. And then I just want to go back to the e-fleets. They seem like kind of a no-brainer at this point in time. I'm just wondering, if there were any changes in planning or any hurdles that you guys kind of have to get through before broader e-fleet adoption? Or is it really just kind of securing that line power?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Well, it's really about the quality of the fleet and what you're signing up for. I think what Halliburton has put together is truly an unique product. We're going to have some form of battery storage attached to that e-fleet so that you're very efficient with the use of natural gas and electricity when that fleet is working. So you do need a pretty big acreage blocks, you need large pads like we have ahead of us, and you need a long-term commitment with a business partner like Halliburton. So I think that -- we checked all those boxes. We feel very good about the e-fleet that's coming on in September, so good that we signed up for a second one. So 2/3 of our simul-frac fleets will be e-fleets with Halliburton. And like you said, it's pretty obvious when the economic and environmental advantages sync up, that's a no-brainer for us. And we're looking forward to getting our first one in the field here in a month.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Leo Mariani from MKM Partners.\nLeo Mariani: I just wanted to clarify a couple of things that I heard on the call here. So in terms of the buyback, I just want to make sure I heard the numbers right. Did you guys say that you could do an additional $650 million in 3Q alone on top of the $200 million you already announced? I just want to make sure I heard that number right.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Leo taking street numbers and multiply it by 75%, taking out the $200 million we spent quarter-to-date and taking out the $0.75 a share base dividend, and that's your math on buybacks for the quarter. And that's something we look at every day. I mean we have our team rerun the model on a weekly basis to figure out how much cash we're going to have in the quarter to buy back shares when there's this much of a dislocation between oil in the public market then oil in the ground.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the debt paydown. Obviously, you talked about paying off some of the Rattler debt here. Can you maybe just give us a little more color on the decision to kind of pay off some of the paying debt, which wasn't kind of due to the end of the decade, I guess some of the 29, 30s or whatnot in the second quarter. Look like you kind of elected to do that versus kind of pay the higher variable dividend because obviously, cash flows were up for the quarter. Just any more color kind of around the thinking there?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. It's a pretty unique opportunity where E&P has a ton of cash flow and bonds trading below par. And we saw that opportunity. Our Board saw with us and decided that buying back some debt well below par was a good use of capital and also exercise accelerates that deleveraging process to give us more confidence in the increased 75% of free cash flow going back to shareholders beginning in Q3.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. And just to clarify on the shareholder returns, you guys do not count debt pay down as a shareholder return, right?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: That's correct.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng: Two questions, please. Can you just remind us what is your hedging policy, if that's an official guidance in terms of what percentage that you want to hedge? Secondly, that with the rising recession period, how that impact your thought process in the 2023 budget in terms of the capital return, balance sheet management and all that?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Good questions, Paul. I'll take the hedging policy, and I'll let Travis talk more macro about 2023. Just generally, we do buy puts for rainy days. So we've gone to the balance sheet is strengthened, we bought more and more puts around $50 to $55 Brent. In that situation, if we do go below $55 Brent, we're probably making capital decisions to slow down, but the balance sheet doesn't blow out. We can still pay our dividend and still generate free cash in that situation. So really protecting for a rainy day, trying to spend around $1.50 to $2 a barrel to buy those puts, and we want to be about 60% hedged going into a particular quarter. So if you look at our hedge book, about 60% hedged for Q3, going down to about 0% by Q2, Q3 of 2023. And we'll just continue to keep rolling that forward for rainy day insurance.\nTravis Stice: And Paul, the energy has typically been a pretty good hedge a bit offset historically. And as you look into 2023, regardless of how you define a recession, it looks like there will be recessionary impacts across our economy. But what's a little bit different this time is that the world today still appears to be chronically short physical barrels with not a lot of spare capacity to fill that gap. And so while we don't necessarily plan on anything other than in the future than our mid-cycle prospect, it looks to me like the macros -- the macro looks pretty positive for energy prices over the next couple of years, even in spite of what I know will be a recessionary impact. And look, if you do see some recessionary impacts, it will probably soften some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing today.\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. I'd make one more point. That's the benefit of this new business model where we're not changing our plans for every $10, $20, $30 move in oil prices. There needs to be a $50 move in oil price lower before we discuss any change to our execution plan. And I think this level-loaded plan, level-loaded activity levels has allowed us to fight off the inflation bug a little better than most. And again, as Travis mentioned, there's no oil out there.\nPaul Cheng: Just curious that when you gentlemen kind of want to keep more cash balance if that's the increasing recession fee?\nKaes Van\u2019t Hof: Yes. Right now there is still cash. We certainly want to cash balance. The cash balance moves a lot right now and when you're generating $1 billion of revenue a month, if the cash balance fluctuates wildly throughout each month. I think generally, having a strong balance sheet, having some cash and having access to capital through a cycle is something us and the Board discuss on a monthly basis. And I think that also ties to where your maturity profile sits, right? So if we not only have less debt, but a longer duration maturity profile, that gives us confidence in our access to capital and our ability to generate cash, given that our cash flow breakeven is down in the mid-30s a barrel.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again for everyone for participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact informations provided. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "And look around being having boots on the ground here in Midland, I think all of our shareholders expect me and us to be in the deal flow at all times. But that just means we look at things coming across the desk, but I go back to say, look at what our behaviors are and the separation between public and private expectations on value. And that's -- I think that's the best way to think about what our forward plans are. Yes, Scott, good question. I would say, generally, we took up CapEx on the low end and took up our average well cost estimate for the year. I would say probably today, we're probably up 15% today from the beginning of the year. We'll probably exit a little higher than that. So probably 15% year-over-year well cost increases, but what the ops team is doing is not taking every phone call and just increasing prices. We're trying to do some things to be more efficient. You mentioned the e-fleet, Travis just mentioned in his opening remarks that we're going to have a second e-fleet coming in early next year. That saves money, not just on the horsepower piece, but on the fuel piece. These will be connected to line power and the back end of a gas plant with burning dry gas in the Permian.  So while gas prices have gone up, they certainly haven't gone up as much as diesel. I would say we'd probably save 50-ish a foot with that -- $50 a foot with that e-fleet. A couple of other things we are doing on top of that, we are adding some preset rigs to replace some big rigs as those preset rigs cost a lot less with these big pads and long cycle investments. We have that ability to do so. Our team is also getting really smart on casing design, cement design, wherever we can pick up pennies that's just our stock in trade. Good question, David. I think generally, if you look at our past history, we kind of whenever a deal happens the next year, infrastructure and midstream is 10% to 15%, getting down to kind of 7% to 8% of total capital in that years. I certainly expect us to be closer to 7% to 8% of total capital in 2024 with a step-down next year in 2023. I think the only wrinkle is we are all us and our peers are all spending a lot of money on environmental cleanup. And so that's probably $30 million to $40 extra million a year that wasn't in the budget in 2017 or 2018. It's necessary dollars, but generally, I'd expect our midstream infrastructure budgets to come down next year and into '24, probably a step change down to 7% or 8% in a couple of years. Yes. I mean I think it's just too early to talk '23 inflation. I'm certainly kind of in the camp that we're not willing to continue to concede margin expansion on the service side perpetually. So we're going to see where things shake out over the next 6 months. Like we said earlier in the call, there are some things we are doing to increase efficiencies and lower costs. I would just say, generally, I think you're right on activity going into 2023. I can't -- I'm not going to comment yet on some respects and where things head particularly with some of the stuff that's out of our control like steel continuing to go up in price. Yes, Derrick, I think that's a fair statement. Certainly, the business has gotten a lot harder to operate and execute this year. It's on us though to make sure we have the right supervision in the field to make sure green hands are trained up quickly. It's something that we are seeing. We do spend a lot of money near the wellhead to make sure our supervision oversees what's going on in the field.  But then there's a couple of other things that kind of go the other way, right? So the spud rigs that we're putting in place, they drill a little slower, but they cost half as much as the big rigs. So I think generally, we kind of hit the efficient frontier on days of TD this year, but now we're doing some things that might slow things down, but spend less money per well. Yes. And then on the tax side, we're pretty low on NOL protection. So if the strip holds, we have about $1 billion of protection next year, we would be above the 15% minimum that's being proposed. So I think generally moving towards a full taxpaying entity at Diamondback which mitigates the impact to us. Certainly, if we're in a different commodity price environment, it might be a different story. But in this environment, we're headed towards full cash taxes in 2024. Yes, Jeanine, good question. With the rate review we expected to close at the end of August, we'll have to pay off that revolver at close. It's about a $200 million revolver that we'll expect to pay with -- down with cash. We also want to take out the Rattler notes, $500 million notes next. There are some reporting requirements with those notes if they continue to stay out there. So I think those 2 items are certainly the priorities, and we probably expect to be in a position to have those taken out by the next time on the phone here. And then I think after that, it goes back to being selective with the other outstanding notes. You'll note that we didn't touch the 2 30-year tranches that we have out there, but we did take down some of our 29 and 31 opportunistically with a discount. But generally, the Rattler notes and Rattler revolvers coming out next and then we'll be more prudent with the rest. Yes. So the 3 simul-frac crews are going to run consistently throughout the whole year. And those 3 have been going this year and they'll be the baseline for next year. We did have a spot crew running for part of Q2 -- spot crew again until probably the end of this year. We try to string together enough pads to make that spot crew cost competitive. And I don't know, Danny, you want to add anything on the spot crew? Yes. It's definitely a little more fixed with project-type work. There is some inflation in those budgets, but that was already somewhat baked in. On the midstream side, in particular, the big bulk items is buying a lot of pipe, and we pre-bought a lot of that. So we knew where that was going to sit on the cost side. On the infrastructure and our environmental side, it's not necessarily a change in plan. As you mentioned, it's just a few inflationary items around the edges, but it's nothing to the extent of what we're seeing on the drilling and completion side when it comes to inflation. Yes. That's a great question, too. Nothing is going to change operationally. And we still like the midstream business. We still like what it does for our consolidated margins. We just felt that it didn't need to be a separate public entity, and so we're able to buy that back in and still run a midstream business that we own 100%. I will say the team has done a good job seeking out third-party opportunities. I wouldn't say it's our core business, but we'll have some real cash flow coming in from third parties given the amount of assets we have on the ground on the midstream side. Yes, Doug, you were a little mixed on that. I couldn't hear you pretty well, but I think I got the gist of it. I think generally, we are going to be very aggressive on the buyback here in Q3 given where the stock is, and where we continue to generate free cash above mid-cycle prices. So already expensed $200 million quarter-to-date. Generally, if you kind of take street numbers and keep our base dividend flat in Q3, we could probably spend another $650 million on buybacks this quarter. So if the stock stays where it is and well stays where it is, we're going to be very, very aggressive on that buyback, which is why the Board signified the confidence in increasing that authorization to $4 billion. None of these prices, Doug, if the stock price stays where it is today, all that cash is going to go towards reducing the share count. I think our interpretation is they still do. Unfortunately, IDCs have become such a small part of the cash flow stream that they're not impacting things much. So that's our understanding today. But you never know if politicians, anything can happen. Yes, Vin, good question. I think just generally, while we are a pretty significant gas producer now at this point, we don't have a lot of control over the molecule. Diamondback has grown through acquisition over the years and with those acquisitions come dedications, and most of those dedications don't come on taking kind rights. So we're certainly doing as much as we possibly can to incentivize pipeline development, getting molecules to the Gulf Coast. We did commit to the Woodford pipeline. We'll have about 1/3 of our gas on that. But generally, you have to have control of that molecule to incentivize development, and we don't have much more beyond that today. Well, it's really about the quality of the fleet and what you're signing up for. I think what Halliburton has put together is truly an unique product. We're going to have some form of battery storage attached to that e-fleet so that you're very efficient with the use of natural gas and electricity when that fleet is working. So you do need a pretty big acreage blocks, you need large pads like we have ahead of us, and you need a long-term commitment with a business partner like Halliburton. So I think that -- we checked all those boxes. We feel very good about the e-fleet that's coming on in September, so good that we signed up for a second one. So 2/3 of our simul-frac fleets will be e-fleets with Halliburton. And like you said, it's pretty obvious when the economic and environmental advantages sync up, that's a no-brainer for us. And we're looking forward to getting our first one in the field here in a month. Yes. Leo taking street numbers and multiply it by 75%, taking out the $200 million we spent quarter-to-date and taking out the $0.75 a share base dividend, and that's your math on buybacks for the quarter. And that's something we look at every day. I mean we have our team rerun the model on a weekly basis to figure out how much cash we're going to have in the quarter to buy back shares when there's this much of a dislocation between oil in the public market then oil in the ground. Yes. It's a pretty unique opportunity where E&P has a ton of cash flow and bonds trading below par. And we saw that opportunity. Our Board saw with us and decided that buying back some debt well below par was a good use of capital and also exercise accelerates that deleveraging process to give us more confidence in the increased 75% of free cash flow going back to shareholders beginning in Q3. That's correct. Yes. Good questions, Paul. I'll take the hedging policy, and I'll let Travis talk more macro about 2023. Just generally, we do buy puts for rainy days. So we've gone to the balance sheet is strengthened, we bought more and more puts around $50 to $55 Brent. In that situation, if we do go below $55 Brent, we're probably making capital decisions to slow down, but the balance sheet doesn't blow out. We can still pay our dividend and still generate free cash in that situation. So really protecting for a rainy day, trying to spend around $1.50 to $2 a barrel to buy those puts, and we want to be about 60% hedged going into a particular quarter. So if you look at our hedge book, about 60% hedged for Q3, going down to about 0% by Q2, Q3 of 2023. And we'll just continue to keep rolling that forward for rainy day insurance. Yes. I'd make one more point. That's the benefit of this new business model where we're not changing our plans for every $10, $20, $30 move in oil prices. There needs to be a $50 move in oil price lower before we discuss any change to our execution plan. And I think this level-loaded plan, level-loaded activity levels has allowed us to fight off the inflation bug a little better than most. And again, as Travis mentioned, there's no oil out there. Yes. Right now there is still cash. We certainly want to cash balance. The cash balance moves a lot right now and when you're generating $1 billion of revenue a month, if the cash balance fluctuates wildly throughout each month. I think generally, having a strong balance sheet, having some cash and having access to capital through a cycle is something us and the Board discuss on a monthly basis. And I think that also ties to where your maturity profile sits, right? So if we not only have less debt, but a longer duration maturity profile, that gives us confidence in our access to capital and our ability to generate cash, given that our cash flow breakeven is down in the mid-30s a barrel."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by highlighting our second quarter performance. We once again delivered operationally, producing over 221,000 barrels of oil per day, near the high end of our quarterly guidance range. Our discretionary cash flow or operating cash flow before working capital changes totaled $1.8 billion, up 27% quarter-over-quarter, setting a new high for the company. This increase was primarily due to a favorable backdrop -- macro backdrop as well as improvement to our realized pricing as hedges put on last year continue to roll off. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 35% quarter-over-quarter. We will return 63% of this free cash flow to our shareholders, well in excess of our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow. This return is made up of our growing and sustainable base dividend, opportunistic share repurchases and a robust variable dividend.  Our annual base dividend is now $3 per share or $0.75 per quarter, representing a 7.1% increase from the company's previous annual base dividend of $2.80 per share or $0.70 per quarter. As previously announced, the Board elected to keep our total dividend per share flat quarter-over-quarter at $3.05, which is comprised of the 75% base dividend and a $2.30 variable dividend. This puts our total annualized 2Q dividend yield of nearly 10%. Additionally, we took advantage of market volatility and repurchased nearly 2.4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of a little over $127 a share for a total cost of approximately $303 million. We believe our opportunistic, disciplined approach to our repurchase program brings the most value forward for our shareholders and continues to give us the flexibility to use either our variable dividend, buybacks, or as has been the case so far in 2022, a combination of both to hit or exceed our returns target. As we move into the second half of the year, it's hard to ignore the amount of free cash flow we expect to generate, around $2.5 billion of current strip pricing. In June, we announced an increase in our capital returns commitment target, moving it up from 50% to at least 75% of free cash flow beginning in the third quarter. At 75%, that's over $1.8 billion return to shareholders or well north of $10 per share in just 2 quarters, for a total annualized return yield of approximately 17%.  This robust free cash flow profile led the Board to double the size of our buyback program from $2 billion to $4 billion, giving us ample running room to be opportunistic in the equity markets. Since the program was initiated in the third quarter of last year, we've repurchased over 8.3 million shares at an average price of $113 a share for a total cost of approximately $940 million. This includes 1.8 million of shares we've already repurchased in the third quarter for a total of $200 million at an average price of $113.70 a share. Our confidence to increase our return through payout is rooted in the strength of our balance sheet. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $337 million in Diamondback senior notes at an average cost of 95.4% of par for a total of $322 million. We focused on our debt coming due over the next 10 years, significantly lowering our maturity towers, while taking advantage of the volatile debt market.  We also recently redeemed $45 million in legacy Energen and QEP notes due 2022 at par. As a result, our balance sheet is stronger today than ever before. Our annualized net debt-to-EBITDA is under 0.7x, and we continue to improve our leverage profile with net debt decreasing by $267 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter. These debt reduction efforts have helped decrease our interest expense by 25% year-over-year, offsetting higher production taxes and lifting costs and helping push our unhedged realized cash margin this quarter to more than 83%, a company record.  Moving to the operations side of the business. The environment in the Permian continues to be challenged. However, we continue to focus on how we can mitigate the inflationary pressures we're seeing across nearly all facets of the business by lowering the variable pieces of our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to keep the high end of our capital guidance range flat at $1.9 billion. We do not anticipate any future changes. Yet we still haven't been able to offset all of the fixed pricing increases we've seen, which is why we've moved up our third quarter capital range to $470 million to $510 million, up from our capital spend of $468 million this quarter. This takes into account the roughly 10% cost increase we expect on the frac side, which is made up of increases in the cost of horsepower, wireline services and fuel.  On the drilling side of the business, we're seeing a similar level of pricing increases, particularly from day rates, casing and cement. In the back half of this year, we plan to operate approximately 12 drilling rigs and 3 frac crews. As we mentioned last quarter, we've partnered with Halliburton to secure our first e-fleet frac crew, which will run in our Martin County acreage off power generated from a central location and delivered via existing lines, not only reducing our Scope 1 emissions profile, but also lowering our completion costs as a result of fuel savings and improved operational efficiency.  We expect this fleet to be operational early in the fourth quarter and it will simply be swapped in for 1 of our existing Halliburton crews. Earlier this month, we continue to lean into this technology and secured our second e-fleet crew. This crew will be operational in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to further reduce costs and decrease our environmental footprint. It will also replace 1 of our existing crews.  On the drilling side, we currently have 1 drilling rig running offline power in the Delaware Basin with 2 more electric rigs expected in 2023. Just as we're seeing on the completion side, the electrification of our drilling fleet has multiple benefits. Additionally, we're utilizing sputter and intermediate rigs to take advantage of lower pricing as compared to the rest of our drilling fleet, and are exploring downsize and surface casing size, intermediate hole size to improve our drilling efficiencies, pushing Diamondback even further down the cost curve.  Lastly, we continue to work to earn our social and environmental license to operate. Part of this is our commitment to provide quarterly disclosures that detail our progress towards our environmental goals. We are proud of how we have performed so far this year when looking at multiple metrics, including recycling nearly 40% of our produced water and keeping our total recordable incident level at multiyear lows. However, flaring continues to be an issue. We are diligently working with our gathering partners to build in redundancy, accelerate plant turnarounds and meet the takeaway needs of our current development plan. We remain committed to ending routine flaring by 2025 and are confident in our ability to achieve that goal.  We've also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to lower our emissions profile by building pipelines and electrifying our production fields. These projects have lowered our costs to date, but due to the increase in the cost of power across the state of Texas, we have had to move our lease operating expense guidance range up by $0.50 a barrel at $4.50 to $5 a barrel. Even with this move, we continue to be the low-cost Permian operator and build on a long track record of cost control.  The second quarter was a record quarter for the company. We delivered on our production guidance, kept costs in line and distributed over 63% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We are well positioned to build off this momentum and are excited to begin returning at least 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders this quarter. We expect this industry-leading cash returns program and our best-in-class operational machine to continue to deliver differentiated results for our shareholders.  With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Well, certainly, as we look into 2023, I think it's a little premature to do much forecasting into 2023. But I can tell you kind of our base case is looking at something at the same activity level, probably generating something in the low single digits in terms of the growth rate. But again, it's more of an output.  But I think what you specifically asked about the call last year, I think I highlighted really 3 things and then subsequently added a fourth, and that was demand at pre-COVID levels. We wanted to see 5-year inventory levels somewhere returning to the 5-year average. We still had a question about OPEC capacity. And the one I added subsequent to our call was the administration continuing to embark uncertainty into our capital allocation process across the industry.  And so certainly 3 of the 4 of those have been answered today, Neal. There's still a lot of administration led uncertainty, both in policy actions and rhetoric. But the other ones certainly appear to be answered. So I think as the industry starts to contribute towards more focus on 2023, I think you'll still be governed primarily by the shareholders who own the companies. But I do think you'll start to see a little bit of growth in the industry as we look into next year. Well, Neal, I think we've been pretty successful with the existing model. We'll always look at seeing what ways we can ensure lower execution cost. We were a little bit plummet in the first quarter with all the commentary about locked in prices and then subsequently followed with CapEx raises. And that's just not the way that we typically try to communicate what our execution focus is.  But I do want to -- I don't know I have a lot of employees listening in the call this morning. And look, I want to give a shout out to our organization for our ability to continue to manage costs in an inflationary environment. Again, about a year ago, Neal, we were talking about how you separate winners and losers in an inflationary environment. It's always those that can control costs. And while we've taken our look on the fixed cost side of an AP ledger, we've done a really remarkable job on the variable cost, and I look for our organization to continue to lean into that in 2023. Well, we certainly think that there's a lot of value in our existing stock price. And we think that, that oil and public equity stocks is really undervalued right now. And so the 2 data points that you mentioned, I think, are good indicators of future behaviors. The first being, we spent about $500 million in the last 2 to 3 months repurchasing shares. And the Board just essentially doubled our authorization up to $4 billion. So the base dividend still remains sacred, sustainable and growing followed by this environment share repurchases. And then as we committed to a month ago, we'll make up the difference and keep our shareholders hold by returning at least 75% of free cash flow. Yes, certainly, Neil, that's the behavior we're demonstrating in. As I just iterated, just to emphasize all in the public markets is really cheaper in the private markets, and I think there continues to be a wide gap between those 2 points. And I think you're also seeing stalled or failed processes as well, which again indicates a spread between bid and ask. So right now, the greatest return for our shareholders is leaning into our repurchase program. Yes. Arun, the big deal is obviously in Q1, $230 million deal. We do capitalize a little G&A and interest which flows through that number, so it's not all property acquisitions. But a couple of things that we do on the property side, it's just the typical blocking and tackling, netting up. We give our land teams the directive that we'd rather drill 100% working interest wells across the board. And so they're always working to net up and block and tackle, but nothing of significance purchased in Q2. Yes. So we have all of our oil on pipes going to the Gulf Coast. A 1/3 of it going to Houston, getting MEH pricing, 2/3 going to Corpus getting Brent pricing. And so we've been the beneficiary of these water Brent WTI spread. We have a little bit of exposure to the Midland market, we also have the ability to kind of flex that to the Gulf Coast with the space that we have. And so the sell-off in WTI versus Brent has resulted in really good oil realizations. No guarantees that it's going to continue forever. But that kind of fits the insurance policy that we put in place to invest in these pipelines and get our barrels to the most liquid markets. Scott, when I talk to our Board and communicate what I think the success indicators are, there's really five. Three of them were foundational that led us to success in the first 10 years. And I think the two that I've added are going to be foundational for the next 10 years. But the three that we built the company on our execution, low-cost operations and transparency. And we've been very successful at differentiating ourselves with those. The two that have recently been added are capital return and decarbonization. And on the capital return, we're now -- our yield is peer-leading. We're competitive on all forms of shareholder return measures. And the last one is decarbonization, and not only in our disclosure, but also in our performance.  And look, those are the five things that we'd sell at. And you can ask us questions about any one of those five, we can articulate chapter verse why those are successful -- why we're successful with those. And while you pointed out a dislocation in stock, we believe fundamentally that we continue to do the right thing for our shareholders to generate the greatest value. And it -- and we believe we're running this company not just for a quarter but for the next 10 years and longer. Derrick, the methane fee tax is one thing that we've looked at. And because of the dollars we've spent over the last 3 years really reducing our methane emissions that doesn't appear as we understand it to be a needle mover for Diamondback. Yes. Those are -- those -- we don't have specific goals that are articulated in the way that you just asked that question. We simply look at the value that we believe the inherent value of the stock versus where it's trading at. And we want to demonstratively move into repurchases when we think there's a big location like we see in today's market. And as we go forward in time, maybe that changes. But as it sits today, as Kaes just outlined with the previous caller, we believe that there's still a lot of value in the stock. And Paul, the energy has typically been a pretty good hedge a bit offset historically. And as you look into 2023, regardless of how you define a recession, it looks like there will be recessionary impacts across our economy. But what's a little bit different this time is that the world today still appears to be chronically short physical barrels with not a lot of spare capacity to fill that gap. And so while we don't necessarily plan on anything other than in the future than our mid-cycle prospect, it looks to me like the macros -- the macro looks pretty positive for energy prices over the next couple of years, even in spite of what I know will be a recessionary impact. And look, if you do see some recessionary impacts, it will probably soften some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing today. Thank you again for everyone for participating in today's call.

I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. In February, Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. We at Diamondback strongly condemned Russia's actions and aggression. Our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of men, women and children affected by this unjust war. And while we desire a quick and peaceful resolution to this conflict, we recognize that this war could go on for quite some time. We will continue to support the innocent victims of Ukraine just as we did earlier this year, when we announced a $10 million commitment to various non-profit entities providing vital humanitarian support. Russia's actions have plunged the global energy markets into turmoil. As the world and especially our allies in the European Union grapple with the potential loss of a major source of their energy supply and rethink their respective energy policies, this war has magnified the interconnectivity of the global energy equation and the impact post-Cold War globalization has had on all supply chains. It has also reminded the world of the importance of the traditional oil and gas to the global economy as we're witnessing the impact high energy costs can have on the consumer and the economy in real time. As the war in Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions continue, Russia's oil production is expected to be impacted by shut-ins, natural declines, storage limitations and lower exports, creating a global shortage of oil. Over the next few years, we will need to make up for this lost production, and we believe that the U.S. oil and gas industry is best suited to provide the low-cost environmentally-friendly barrels needed to ensure global energy supply. However, today, we are operating in a constrained environment with inflationary pressures continuing to increase across all facets of our business. Also labor and materials shortages are now present across the supply chain. We at Diamondback are fortunate to have secured the necessary equipment, personnel and materials to run our 2022 capital program, but increase in activity now would result in capital efficiency degradation that would not meaningfully contribute to fixing the global supply and demand imbalance in the oil market today. Therefore, Diamondback remains committed to maintaining our current oil production levels of approximately 220,000 net barrels of oil per day. While we believe that efficiently growing our production base is achievable over the long term, we do not feel that today is the appropriate time to begin spending dollars that would not equate to additional barrels into multiple quarters from now. We continue to focus on capital efficiency and strive to operate with the highest level of environmental and social responsibility. At Diamondback, we plan to invest approximately $60 million to reduce our direct emissions and lower our carbon intensity, including ending routine flaring by 2025. This figure does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars we expend to electrify our production fields and to build pipelines to ensure we produce and transport fluid with the lowest emission intensity possible. These investments are not only good for the environment, but also smart economic decisions that we expect to lower our operating costs. By investing in infrastructure in our high activity levels, we now have the ability to run a dedicated electric fleet for the foreseeable future. We've partnered with Halliburton to secure our first electric frac fleet, which will run in our Martin County acreage off power generated from the central location and delivered via existing lines, reducing our Scope 1 emissions profile. This partnership will also lower our cost per foot, primarily due to fuel savings, decrease our footprint on location and increase our operational efficiency as a result of lower maintenance and non-productive time. We expect this fleet to be operational in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we also announced initiatives to reduce our Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions or GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduced methane intensity by at least 70% of from 2019 levels by 2024. In 2021 alone, we reduced our Scope 1 GHG and methane intensities by 15% and 21%, respectively, from the 2020 levels. Lastly, we launched our Net Zero Now strategy under which, as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have zero net Scope 1 GHG emissions as we offset these emissions with certified carbon credits. Moving to first quarter performance. Our production of 223,000 barrels of oil exceeded the high end of our guidance range, creating $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. We were able to keep our capital costs in check, spending $437 million in CapEx during the quarter, nearly hitting the low end of our guidance range of $435 million to $475 million, and pushing our free cash flow for the quarter to $974 million. We returned $555 million of cash back to our stockholders or $3.09 per share representing 57% of Q1 2022 free cash flow and 50% of adjusted free cash flow, which we calculated by adding back the $135 million in cash we used to terminate certain future hedge positions. This return was made up of stock repurchases, the base dividend in our first variable dividend. As we've said in the past, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we stuck with our plan of evaluating our share repurchases just as we would with any acquisition. A buyback must generate a return well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, assuming a reasonable mid-cycle oil price. In the first quarter, our price debt was approximately $60 a barrel, and as such, we were able to take advantage of some of the volatility in the new market and repurchased 57,000 shares at an average price of $117 a share. Through the end of the first quarter, we've spent about $440 million or 22% of the $2 billion program our Board authorized last September. Additionally, we once again increased our growing base dividend, which we view as our primary, constant and predictable form of shareholder returns. It's now at $2.80 a share on an annualized basis, up 17% quarter-over-quarter and approaching our target of $3 a share. We have now increased our base dividend by a quarterly CAGR of over 11% since it was initiated in 2018. Today, this represents a current yield of just over 2%. Finally, with the free cash flow returns through our base dividend and repurchase program does not equal at least 50% of our free cash flow for that particular quarter, and we've committed to make our investors whole by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend and most importantly, allows at least 50% of free cash flow to be returned. For our strategy, we allocated $422 million to our first variable dividend this quarter or $2.35 per share, putting our total dividend payout in the first quarter at $3.05 per share or nearly a 10% total dividend yield. We met our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to our stockholders and use the remaining cash to strengthen our financial and operating position. In the quarter, we fully redeemed $500 million of notes due in 2024 and $1 billion of notes due in 2025. We also took advantage of the flat long end of the curve by pricing $750 million in new 30-year senior notes at 4.25%. This liability management exercise reduced our absolute debt by $750 million, decreased annual interest expense by $20 million, pushed out the average weighted maturity of our debt profile by 5 years and kept our average weighted cost of debt flat. With only one tranche of near-term maturities outstanding, we are pleased with the progress we've made to improve our investment-grade balance sheet and are nearing our leverage target of approximately 1x at $50 oil which would equate to approximately $3.5 billion in absolute debt at the parent level. We also continue to put our cash to work by high grading our existing inventory position through small bolt-on acquisitions. And we are excited about blocking up our reward position with the acquisition we completed in January. This bolt-on added approximately 6,000 net acres in Ward County and gave us an additional 60 long lateral locations with an 85% net revenue interest in a high rate of return area. In fact, we've already begun drilling the position, but do not expect to have production until late this year. As we look to our outlook for the rest of 2022, our simple plan has not changed. Maintained oil production of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day by spending between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. At the current strip pricing, this production and capital spend equates to approximately 400 -- $4.5 billion of free cash flow, which per our returns framework, gives us a minimum of $2.25 billion of cash back to our investors. We're off to a good start for the year, mitigating inflationary pressures while justifying our social and environmental license to operate. We believe our capital discipline and returns profile is still the best near-term path to equity value creation, while our operational execution provides differentiated returns to our shareholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities.\nNeal Dingmann : Travis, first question really, the obvious just on shareholder return and odds. Specifically -- well, I guess maybe tackling it a little bit different. I'm just wondering what levers would you all think about pulling if oil were to go potentially in a super spike scenario, where if Russia oil would decouple or if oil completely goes the other way and rolls, assuming something happens to Putin. So I'm really just trying to get a sense of what sort of quarterly changes you would or would not make if this were to happen down the line.\nTravis Stice : Well, certainly, from a quarterly perspective, from an operational perspective, we're pretty set on this year's plan. And we have the ability, obviously, to ratchet things down, but as I tried to lay out in our prepared remarks, ratcheting things up right now is not really the right answer. If you're asking a question specifically about buybacks, Neal, we're going to stay disciplined in our approach to buying our stock back. When we look at mid-teens returns or mid-cycle pricing, that's really not changing. I think what matters most though, Neal, is that we're returning cash to shareholders, and we're giving our shareholders the flexibility to do with that cash as they see fit. That's kind of how I view the world right now, Neal.\nNeal Dingmann : No, I like that flexibility. I think it makes a lot of sense as I think investors do. Then my second question just on your capital guidance, specifically looking at the $150 million of inflation, the $125 DUC benefit and then the $60 midstream incremental moves that you talked about since '21, really just wondering, is there a potential for each of these to move further this year? And then does this sort of '22 spend set you up for a stable '23 production?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neal, I don't see any changes. I mean I think we're seeing inflationary pressures across the value chain. Fortunately, we baked a lot of that into our guidance for the year. And fortunately, we had a strong Q1, which if you annualize Q1, you'd be towards the low end of the range. So it gives us a little flexibility in the back half of the year. And second to that, I think we're debating internally what does 2023 and beyond look like. We're not ready to give an answer to that today. But it doesn't mean that the plan is zero growth forever. I think we have the flexibility to ramp up a little bit if we needed to, if that was the decision come kind of late summer for 2023 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.\nTravis Stice : Arun, are you on mute?\nArun Jayaram : Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't hear my name. Sorry about that. Travis, I want to get your thoughts. Obviously, looking at the near-term performance of the stock, you've clearly lagged your oil beta as well as our sense of execution, which has been good in the field. So I was wondering if you and/or Kaes could talk a little bit about the bear thesis on the stock. As you know, there's a number of properties on the market in the Permian and the market appears to be concerned about Diamondback executing perhaps a procyclical type of M&A deal in this type of environment as the buyback pace has waned a bit. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about that and just your broader thoughts on M&A in this kind of $100-plus oil environment.\nTravis Stice : Arun, if I could control the price of stock, it would be a lot higher than it is today, granted. But I can't. But what we can control is how we allocate capital, how we execute in the field, how we can generate more cash per barrels than anyone else. Those are the things that we really can control. It is -- we do hear a lot about this narrative that Diamondback is a serial acquirer, and let me just put it simply. Large-scale M&A today is quite frankly, off the table. We've got nothing on our deal sheet that's considered more than a tuck-in like the one just announced in my prepared remarks. This remains a seller's market, and we're not going to underwrite M&A at today's oil prices, just like we're not going to underwrite repurchasing stocks at today's oil prices. So I hope that's clear in both of those 2 points that I made, Arun.\nArun Jayaram : Great, great. So it sounds like large-scale M&A is off the table today, if I -- based on those comments.\nTravis Stice : Yes. Let me reiterate that. Large-scale M&A is off the table. I'll reiterate that point.\nArun Jayaram : Okay. Yes. That's clear. The second point I wanted to make is just looking at the cash flow statement for calendar 2022, on our model which is a bit below the strip call it, $6.2 billion, $6.4 billion of CFO, a little under $1.9 million of CapEx. If we go through all of the uses of cash including nearly $800 million of debt reduction year-to-date, we'd still get 1 -- over $1.2 billion of cash build this year. So I was wondering if you could talk about some of the priorities for this excess cash. I think you highlighted maybe a debt target for FANG, stand-alone at $3.5 billion. But I was wondering maybe you could talk about uses of cash if this high commodity price environment continues.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Arun, good question. I wouldn't say $3.5 billion is a hard and fast number before we ramp up shareholder returns, but certainly would like to take advantage of this market by taking out our 2026 notes and, therefore, not having any near-term maturities before 2029, which opens up the door for accelerated cash returns. I think that's going to happen sooner rather than later. Just generally, we do want to keep a cash balance, but we're not going to sit on a large cash balance, and we think no debt isn't the right answer. So we're not going to sit on it. And therefore, we're going to return it. This is an active discussion we have with our Board every quarter on cash returns. And I think generally, we're going to be supportive of more cash returns as the balance sheet is put in fortress shape.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Nitin Kumar from Wells Fargo.\nNitin Kumar : I want to start with Permian takeaway on the gas side has been a topic of discussion over the last 3 months or so. Just want to see what you guys are seeing on the ground and maybe if you could talk a little bit about your low assurance into '23 and '24?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Nitin, I think people are -- on the midstream and the upstream side, are coming together to solve this problem. And you've seen a couple of announcements on expansions of a couple of existing pipes in the last couple of weeks. We still think there needs to be a large pipe built, new-build pipe, which hopefully happens here in the next month or 2 from an announcement perspective. And generally, going back to what we said last quarter, we have -- we don't have take-in-kind rights for all of our gas, but we do have full assurance for all of our gas. So we are exposed to Waha. We've hedged much of our exposure in 2023. And we think that's the tight spot. And the gas is going to move. It's just a matter of price. And I think there's a lot of constraints on Permian growth right now as we've seen anecdotes from others on trying to ramp activity into this constrained environment. So generally, I think the gas thing gets solved. I think both sides are as incentivized as ever to build the pipes and that should clear the way for Permian growth in the out years.\nNitin Kumar : Great. As my follow-up, inflation did not feature as prominently in your release as it did for others, but you did talk about constraints. Kaes, you also mentioned possibly looking for growth. Are there any specific areas as we look into 2023 that are tighter on the supply chain side? And maybe talk a little bit about how you're contracting for those services right now.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I would say right now, everything is tight across the board, whether it's sand, casing, new high-spec rigs, frac crews; everything is very, very tight. We're doing our part by keeping our activity levels flat. We're running the 12 rigs we need and we're running the 3 simul-frac tractors we need with a fourth spot crew. But hearing anecdotes of not being able to get casing, not being able to get sand, these are things that we've done our best to secure, and I think we're in a really good position. And it kind of ties to what Travis was saying, is if you're going to bet on someone in an inflationary environment, it's Diamondback. I mean we control costs as well as anybody in this business, and that's what we're laser-focused on in 2022.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Hanold : If I could kind of flash back to the shareholder returns kind of strategy here, and I think you guys have been pretty articulate in how you think of a big picture. But -- and Travis, I know you made a point of one -- ones here earlier in this call about does it make sense to buy back Diamondback stock at this point in time. So when we think about how you return that cash going forward, should we anticipate at kind of heightened oil price levels, you are going to stick to say, that $60 mid-cycle price and the large quantum of return likely is going to be in a variable dividend? Is that how we should think about it until there's a more material pullback in sort of the equities here?\nTravis Stice : Yes. I think that's a reasonable approach. But Scott, I also think you have to be cognizant of what our industry has done over the last 10 years in respect to share repurchases. We've typically, as an industry, chased the oil price and repurchased shares back all the way to the top. We're trying to be mindful of that and disciplined in our approach. And I've tried to be as articulate as I could about the way that we think about share repurchases as any other form of capital allocation with that mid-cycle oil price. Mid-cycle oil price isn't -- [it's like] oil price, it doesn't change. Now what could change is that as we continue to accumulate cash, that's going to have an influence on our future capital allocation, both in the form of share repurchases and increased variable payouts.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I wouldn't say we haven't had opportunities. I mean we've had opportunities even in Q2 to repurchase shares given the volatility in this space. So there's enough volatility out there to give us opportunities. And I would say the share repurchase is more defensive than offensive. And when things are going really, really well like they did in the first quarter, we make up the difference with the variable dividend.\nScott Hanold : Got it. Appreciate that. And on the first quarter results, what to me stood out was your oil price realizations were extremely strong. Can you talk about the dynamics specifically in the quarter and if that's continuing at this point in time? It looked like you all got average premium to WTI pricing.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I would say it was more one-off than anything, but the volatility in Brent and Dated Brent, in particular, versus WTI benefited us. I'd say about 30% of our oil production received a Dated Brent price for barrels going to Europe, and that was in our favor there in Q1. So I think generally, we've always guided to 95% of WTI as our realization. That might need to move up a little bit, particularly with WTI going up as much as it has, but it's going to be tough to hit 100 consistently.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Deckelbaum from Cowen.\nDavid Deckelbaum : Thanks, Travis and Kaes and Danny, thanks for squeezing me in. Travis, I wanted to just follow up on your comments that you made around capital efficiency degradation for deploying capital in today's environment. I guess how do you think about those conditions resulting in improved capital efficiency over time? I guess it sounds like the variables are that -- there really just isn't very much availability of equipment, significant delays. I know that you guys are benefiting from having prepurchased a lot of -- some of the raw materials for this year's program. But I guess, are we to think about -- when you talk specifically around capital efficiency, if you stood up a rig today, that the free cash payback period on that would be significantly longer than the year?\nTravis Stice : Yes, I think there's 2 points. Your first one is correct that capital efficiency does imply that the payout for that investment is much longer, notwithstanding the fact that the production from that, the way we develop these assets with multi-well pads is quarters away. The second thing is, is that in the hyperinflationary environment like we are in the Permian right now, standing up the rig using your example really means that we're, in most instances, we're going to be taking that rig away from somebody else. So -- and that applies to really all services. And -- so if you're looking to increase the total barrel production out of the Permian, you just really need to be reallocating, so it's not really helping the global supply/demand equation because that's really how tight the services are out here today.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, it was more a macro comment that the service market is a zero-sum game right now and us stepping on the accelerator would result in someone else not. And so we want to maintain that capital efficiency that we have and the trust that we've earned with investors that this is the plan.\nTravis Stice : We've seen in the past in these hyper inflationary environments that supply chains ultimately normalize. But it takes time for that normalization to occur, which is measured in quarters, if not years for it to normalize. And when it does, then you start to have a greater opportunity to grow without degrading your capital efficiency.\nDavid Deckelbaum : I appreciate the responses, Travis. The last one for me is just on the Ward County acquisition, it sounds like you guys are already drilling some of those locations there. I guess when you're making a -- when you're making an acquisition right now, I know you said large scale is off the table. But are these smaller deals -- should we think about these locations moving to the front of your program?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. These were some pretty high-returning locations mainly because the acreage has an 84% NRI. So an extra 9% NRI was about 1/3 of the deal value. And so that makes a completely undeveloped unit in the Delaware basin very competitive with Midland Basin unit. So I'd say this deal is the exception versus the norm. It was agreed to about 6 months ago. But if other opportunities like that come about, I think it's a good use of cash as long as we're not impacting our cash return program.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel.\nDerrick Whitfield : Congrats on your quarter-end update. Following up on David's first question, could you broadly outline the macro and investor conditions that would support a decision to pursue growth over 5% per annum?\nTravis Stice : I think what you're asking us to do is start forecasting 2023 growth rates that we're not really ready to talk about 2023. I think though, Derrick, if you look at the macro uncertainties that are still out there, let me try to enumerate some of those. You've still got Iranian barrels, whether they're going to find a way in the market. You've got Venezuela, you've got Libya, you've got continued a little bit of surplus capacity in the OPEC+. Those are all volumes that can come on to the equation of the supply-demand equation. You've also got the continued demand impacts of COVID, particularly in the Asian markets right now. And then lastly, to say bluntly, the administration's comments are certainly causing a lot of uncertainty in the market, both in the terms of regulatory taxation, legislation and negative rhetoric towards our industry. And that creates uncertainty in our owners', our shareholders' minds about what the future of this industry really is. And so I think this represents on that front, a pretty unique time to have a sober assessment of what an energy policy really needs to look like for the United States, one that recognizes all forms of energy, while at the same time, having aspirational goals about a more sustainable future.\nDerrick Whitfield : Thanks, Travis. I certainly appreciate those comments and understand those. As my second question, I wanted to follow up on gas egress and more specifically, your view on how you'd like to position Diamondback in the value chain for LNG offtake. With the understanding that you are an oil company at the core, have you evaluated or would you consider direct offtake contracts with European utilities to better position Diamondback for higher realizations?\nKaes Van't Hof: I think we consider it, Derrick, we just want to have control of enough molecules to do anything meaningful. This goes back to the take-in-kind rights, right? We sell -- we exchange to the custody of the molecule at the wellhead outside of 200 million a day we have on the Whistler pipeline going down to Katy in South Texas. So we really don't have control over a lot of gas. The company's grown through acquisitions. A Lot of times, the gas came dedicated already with no take-in-kind rights for that operator.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Gruber : I guess just listening to the conversation here this morning you guys mentioned the e-frac coming in during 4Q and how that will help efficiency. And there's obviously been various drilling optimization software that has been developed to help trim those drill times. Is there an ability for Diamondback to grow volumes modestly without adding an additional rig or 2 and more frac time? Or is that just not possible?\nKaes Van't Hof: I think it's certainly possible, Scott, and certainly it's part of our assessment of where we're headed and also ties into this mantra of capital efficient growth or capital efficient maintenance. It's amazing what the organization has done in terms of efficiencies. Three simul-frac fleets have doubled our efficiency on the frac side. And on the drilling side, like you mentioned, the clear fluid drilling system as well as moving on to electrification has reduced costs and cycle times. So I certainly think it's possible, and we continue to see improvements throughout this year and certainly going into our calculus for what does the next few years look like.\nTravis Stice : And Scott, when you think about the improvements that Kaes just talked about that are operationally and execution focused, those are made irrespective of commodity price or service costs. And what's exciting about those and what I'm so proud of our organization about is those are permanent. Those are permanent savings that go forward. And when you start doing the relative game to Diamondback versus others' performance, that's what creates the spread. And this is not just a recent phenomenon. Our organization, their stock and trade has been these types of incremental improvements year-over-year regardless of the economic or commodity price backdrop. And I think it's fair that we're going to continue to do that. It gets harder in times like today, but it doesn't mean that we still can't find differential ways to do more with less. And the second point is that as we fully embrace the Northern Midland Basin with the assets that we acquired through Guidon and QEP coming on the production mix back half of this year and fully into 2023. Those wells are so good, you will see a natural uptick in capital efficiency because we -- those wells deliver more per dollar spent.\nScott Gruber : Got you. Yes. I guess that was the kind of heart of my question is, is there enough kind of incremental gain on the kind of process efficiency coupled with the Martin County program hitting its full stride? Is there enough combination there that you can actually achieve, call it, 5% growth without adding an additional rig?\nKaes Van't Hof: We'll see. It's still early. So we'll see. I think we're really focused on getting through the rest of this year in a very tight inflationary environment.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering.\nJeoffrey Lambujon : My first one is just a follow-up on some of the cost commentary from earlier, if you wouldn't mind sharing some additional insight that you've got just given your history in the basin. But with your outlook for well cost per foot for the year, in particular staying consistent with the initial guide even as other operators are talking up quarter-to-quarter changes with uncertainty beyond that as you go through the year, I just wanted to ask about what you are doing in the field to mitigate higher costs you might be experiencing or just plans to -- for activity in the field to mitigate expected costs in the future just in terms of flexibility around who you contract with for services while still maintaining and upholding the low-cost operations that Diamondback's known for?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question, Jeff. I mean we've obviously baked in some inflation into these costs and went into the year at a lower well cost when we went into 2021 and even in the face of an inflationary environment last year. But generally, there are service providers pushing price. And sometimes we decide not to keep working with those particular service providers. So I think our ability to control costs is because we control a lot of the process with our business partners on the service side. We recognize they need to make margin. But if there is another provider that can provide the same service for less cost, we'll go that route. And we've done that a few times this year. So that's helped us control things a little bit.\nTravis Stice : And Jeff, those are true strategic comments that Kaes just made. But look, tactically, what we continue to see is our operations organization getting the TD faster on a quarterly basis. And that kind of goes back to the comments I made earlier. This is what we do. So getting the TD faster translates to cost savings that become permanent. Also completing more lateral feet per day as an efficiency gain this year is another one of those tactical things that we're doing that's helping us hold the line on an increasing cost backdrop. So -- and just to emphasize, we always get the question asked, what is it that makes the secret sauce of Diamondback in our low-cost operations as you just pointed out. And it's really not 1 or 2 things. It's really a consistent laser focus on every single decision that we make that spends dollars. And the cumulative effect of that laser-like focus allows Diamondback just not on a quarterly basis, but now almost for a 10-year time period, maintain the lowest cost operations and the best execution out in the Permian.\nJeoffrey Lambujon : Perfect. I appreciate the detail and the reminders. My second one is just on the balance sheet, really just around what you see what's left on the opportunity for further strengthening from here. I know you all talked about and flagged that 2026 is in the past and spoke to debt targets that can also be flexible. But it seems like you are within striking distance here of an optimal balance sheet position for the medium to long term. So just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that given the progress you've made so far, especially recently. And I apologize if I missed this earlier.\nKaes Van't Hof: No. Listen, I think we feel fine with everything we have due 2029 or later sitting out there. And if we take care of the 2026 is, which should be in a matter of months, not years, we'll be in a position to have discussions about increasing shareholder returns beyond what we're already doing.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicholas Pope from Seaport Research.\nNicholas Pope : First, I wanted to commend you guys on that ESG kind of real-time data that you are providing because I think it's probably one of the best in the sector. But you provide the data, so I've got a question about it a little bit. You kind of talked about kind of gross gas flared. And I saw in 1Q, it kind of creeped up from kind of where it was in fourth quarter, where it was in the first quarter of last year as kind of a percent of total like gross gas production. So I was curious, like is it -- what drives that? Is there some seasonality in that? Is it -- I mean, is it limited capacity to move gas? I mean I'm just trying to understand a little bit about kind of the movement in that metric, which is a big part of kind of the CO2 emissions, I think that you all report.\nTravis Stice : Sure, Nick. Two things. The first comment on disclosure, I appreciate you saying that. Our Board has mandated us to not only be best-in-class on actual performance, but also best-in-class in disclosure. And there's a lot of our organization that is focused on delivering these results, and we're proud to report them. And I think if those who haven't had a chance that are on the call to look at the ESG detail in our investor deck, which is up on our website, I strongly encourage you to do that. The second part of your question, Nick, was gross gas. And that's -- the reason we reported that is because that's a way that you can back calculate and verify our numbers, but that has to do with the acquired volumes. Kaes?\nKaes Van't Hof: No, it's all due to plant turnarounds, right? I mean we put out a slide that explains that 75% to 80% of our flaring is due to downstream issues. And we're trying to push and incentivize our business partners on the midstream side to do better in terms of flaring, sometimes through contracts where we pay them more per Mcf, if take pay less than 1%. But really, timing-wise, Q1, a lot of turnarounds from some of our business partners on the midstream side. There is some seasonality to it, but that's why we push them for more interconnectivity among their peers, so that if their plant goes down, they can send it to another plant or to a peer and we'll still pay them. So part of the whole value chain is we need our friends on the G&T side to work with us here.\nTravis Stice : And Nick, we view that as a win-win or a lose-lose. So we're not trying to position ourselves as a win versus lose on the G&T side. We know that emissions from the product we produce need to be eliminated and minimized as quickly as we can. And that's the reason that we spend time in conversations like this talking about our G&T business partners as well as including some slides in the ESG detailed part of the deck that highlights what Diamondback was responsible for and what our midstream guys were responsible for both planned and unplanned outages.\nNicholas Pope : Got it. That's actually very helpful. I appreciate it. And kind of further on to the kind of the other components of this, you kind of talked about the electrification of compression of parts of the frac fleets. Is that something that -- is that going to be showing up as part of the LOE kind of improvements that you're working on? Is that where it shows up? Or is it primarily going to be something that is reflected in these ESG metrics when you think about that move towards the electrification of a lot of assets?\nKaes Van't Hof: Well, electrification in the field helps LOE. So electrifying all of our fields is not only environmentally friendly, but also cost friendly, getting rid of infield power generation. But on the frac side and the drilling rig side, moving rigs and frac fleets to electrification would help lower costs on the capital side, but also then lower our combustion percentage of Scope 1 emissions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.\nDouglas Leggate : I guess places and cues are directly correlated with the commentary around your variable dividend. Thanks for getting me on this morning. It's good to talk to you, Travis. Travis, I got to hit this right up-front. Look, if you -- how can you say you think your stock is undervalued, but you're not prepared to buy it? Variable dividends take cash off the balance sheet. They don't get capitalized in the business, which is a finite inventory. How do you expect the market to pay you for a variable dividend? Just, to me, in this business, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I'd just love your perspective.\nTravis Stice : Yes, Doug, listen, we've tried to outline exactly our thoughts on the rationale behind all of those things. My comments on the stock price is really a function of what I can control and not control, and I can't control the actual market, what the stock is -- what the actual stock price is. We try to be very disciplined and we are very disciplined in the calculus we use to buy anything, whether it's our stock, whether it's acquisitions or whether it's making drill well decisions. And I've tried to outline the mid-cycle oil price of $60 a barrel. I think that could change as we continue to accumulate free cash. Mid-stock oil price won't change, but our ability to buy more shares back will change, but we made a commitment to distribute at least 50% of our free cash flow and other than [ordinate] on the balance sheet, which we said we're not going to do, we're going to hard that commitment and return at least 50%.\nDouglas Leggate : Yes. I understand completely the rationale. It's an intellectual debate, perhaps, but equity volatility correlates with balance sheet structure. So EOG, Pioneer, some of your other peers are choosing to have net debt zero. So we'll carry on the debate. I want to ask about the -- a more specific question to the current commodity environment and how it's impacting your cash flow outlook, specifically, cash taxes, so this might be for Kaes. We've got a much higher gas price, obviously. We've got a backwardated curve, obviously. I assume that's accelerating the inflection in when you get to a full cash tax position. So if you can just give us an idea what you see happening in that regard? And I'll leave it there.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question, Doug. We raised our cash tax percentage this quarter because we weren't running $100 oil in our initial guidance in February. There's still some protection this year. We do have about $1.5 billion of NOLs that will protect us next year. So we won't be a full cash taxpayer next year in '2023. Some were NOLs that got pushed out, couldn't use it this year, so we've got to use it next year. And then commodity prices stay where they are. Full cash taxpayer by 2024.\nDouglas Leggate : So just to be clear, even with the forward curve case, you're still good through the end of next year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean partially, right? I think our protection will decrease next year, but there will be some protection and then full cash tax payer in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question is from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc.\nLeo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the inflation commentary here. Just wanted to kind of clarify sort of what I heard. It sounds like you'll have all your equipment here for your 2022 program. But just wanted to get a sense if generally, the prices for the big ticket items on the service side are locked in for 2022? Or perhaps could you see, I'll just call it some inflationary risk in the CapEx maybe in the second half? And then as we look to 2023, is that where you think that inflation could be maybe a larger problem if commodity prices are well bid later this year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean, it really depends, right? I mean it depends on what happens in the situation with Russia and Ukraine as it relates to pipe costs, right? We thought pipe costs were going to come down in the back half of the year. It doesn't look like that's going to happen this year. It might happen next year. I mean I think there's a little push/pull, Leo, with this business tends to sort out supply chain issues over time. And as commodity prices stay stronger for longer, some of the tightness will get sorted out. So certainly, I'm not going to make a prediction that 2023 inflation is going to be as much as 2022, but we're certainly seeing inflationary pressures across all the big ticket items right now. And some of that pricing for the big ticket items is incentivizing new builds, which tends to lower prices. So I think there's a little bit of push/pull. Jury's still out on 2023.\nTravis Stice : Look, we will be affected by inflation, no 2 ways about it. But the bet that we've always made here internally is that we will be affected the least of anyone else because of our efficient operations. And you see it in the first quarter of this year, we were all affected by the same inflation, and we were at the low end of our CapEx guide for the quarter. Recognizing that's going to be a challenge to continue that performance, I still bet on our organization to deliver.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And certainly, I can see that from where you came out in 1Q on CapEx. And it looks like on the second quarter CapEx guidance, you seem equally confident that you can kind of keep the costs under control. So is this something that could maybe creep up more in the second half this year? Or do you kind of have rigs and crews and pipe locked in here in '22?\nKaes Van't Hof: I think we feel really good about the budget. Obviously, we're on pace for the low end. I think that's going to be tough, but we feel really good about this year's budget.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.\nPaul Cheng : Two questions, please. I think first is for Kaes. In the cash tax, I just want to confirm in the accounting that you guys have done. You will estimate for the full year what is the cash tax rate and then you apply the same tax rate in each quarter roughly, flat on that and not necessarily based on saying that later in the year that you may have already used some more on the NOL so you will have a higher cash tax. And also then, if we assume, let's say, call it an average $100 WTI price for next year, I assume the cash tax rate would be higher. Any rough guidance that you can give? That's the first question.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I'll take the second part first. Certainly, the cash tax guidance would be higher next year if we have these commodity prices. I think it's basically pretty close to a full cash taxpayer outside of $1.8 billion of protection. And then second, I think your question related to when does the cash exit the system for cash taxes. And we'll be making payments, our first payment in June for the first half of the year and then quarterly thereafter now that we're heading to cash tax land.\nPaul Cheng : And yes. So is the cash tax rate, say, for the year would be about the same or that they still have quite a fluctuation?\nKaes Van't Hof: No, there's no fluctuation. So our burden in Q2 is expected to be higher than our burden was in Q1. It's just that the cash is going to leave the system in Q2.\nPaul Cheng : I see. Okay. And the second question is that for this year, it looks like from equipment availability and also a lot in the service price, you guys already done quite a lot. For next year, any kind of rough percentage you can provide how much of your service for CapEx or equipment that you already locked in with a debt price or that is 100% subject to the market conditions at this point?\nKaes Van't Hof: I would say most of it is subject to market conditions. We did -- we talked about the e-fleet, we signed a deal with Halliburton. That price is fixed and our sand price is fixed. So the rest is going to fluctuate, and we'll see where the market goes over the next few months.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice : Thank you again to everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes, Neal, I don't see any changes. I mean I think we're seeing inflationary pressures across the value chain. Fortunately, we baked a lot of that into our guidance for the year. And fortunately, we had a strong Q1, which if you annualize Q1, you'd be towards the low end of the range. So it gives us a little flexibility in the back half of the year. And second to that, I think we're debating internally what does 2023 and beyond look like. We're not ready to give an answer to that today. But it doesn't mean that the plan is zero growth forever. I think we have the flexibility to ramp up a little bit if we needed to, if that was the decision come kind of late summer for 2023 and beyond. Yes. Arun, good question. I wouldn't say $3.5 billion is a hard and fast number before we ramp up shareholder returns, but certainly would like to take advantage of this market by taking out our 2026 notes and, therefore, not having any near-term maturities before 2029, which opens up the door for accelerated cash returns. I think that's going to happen sooner rather than later. Just generally, we do want to keep a cash balance, but we're not going to sit on a large cash balance, and we think no debt isn't the right answer. So we're not going to sit on it. And therefore, we're going to return it. This is an active discussion we have with our Board every quarter on cash returns. And I think generally, we're going to be supportive of more cash returns as the balance sheet is put in fortress shape. Yes. Nitin, I think people are -- on the midstream and the upstream side, are coming together to solve this problem. And you've seen a couple of announcements on expansions of a couple of existing pipes in the last couple of weeks. We still think there needs to be a large pipe built, new-build pipe, which hopefully happens here in the next month or 2 from an announcement perspective. And generally, going back to what we said last quarter, we have -- we don't have take-in-kind rights for all of our gas, but we do have full assurance for all of our gas. So we are exposed to Waha. We've hedged much of our exposure in 2023. And we think that's the tight spot. And the gas is going to move. It's just a matter of price. And I think there's a lot of constraints on Permian growth right now as we've seen anecdotes from others on trying to ramp activity into this constrained environment. So generally, I think the gas thing gets solved. I think both sides are as incentivized as ever to build the pipes and that should clear the way for Permian growth in the out years. Yes. I would say right now, everything is tight across the board, whether it's sand, casing, new high-spec rigs, frac crews; everything is very, very tight. We're doing our part by keeping our activity levels flat. We're running the 12 rigs we need and we're running the 3 simul-frac tractors we need with a fourth spot crew. But hearing anecdotes of not being able to get casing, not being able to get sand, these are things that we've done our best to secure, and I think we're in a really good position. And it kind of ties to what Travis was saying, is if you're going to bet on someone in an inflationary environment, it's Diamondback. I mean we control costs as well as anybody in this business, and that's what we're laser-focused on in 2022. Yes. I wouldn't say we haven't had opportunities. I mean we've had opportunities even in Q2 to repurchase shares given the volatility in this space. So there's enough volatility out there to give us opportunities. And I would say the share repurchase is more defensive than offensive. And when things are going really, really well like they did in the first quarter, we make up the difference with the variable dividend. Yes. I would say it was more one-off than anything, but the volatility in Brent and Dated Brent, in particular, versus WTI benefited us. I'd say about 30% of our oil production received a Dated Brent price for barrels going to Europe, and that was in our favor there in Q1. So I think generally, we've always guided to 95% of WTI as our realization. That might need to move up a little bit, particularly with WTI going up as much as it has, but it's going to be tough to hit 100 consistently. Yes, it was more a macro comment that the service market is a zero-sum game right now and us stepping on the accelerator would result in someone else not. And so we want to maintain that capital efficiency that we have and the trust that we've earned with investors that this is the plan. Yes. These were some pretty high-returning locations mainly because the acreage has an 84% NRI. So an extra 9% NRI was about 1/3 of the deal value. And so that makes a completely undeveloped unit in the Delaware basin very competitive with Midland Basin unit. So I'd say this deal is the exception versus the norm. It was agreed to about 6 months ago. But if other opportunities like that come about, I think it's a good use of cash as long as we're not impacting our cash return program. I think we consider it, Derrick, we just want to have control of enough molecules to do anything meaningful. This goes back to the take-in-kind rights, right? We sell -- we exchange to the custody of the molecule at the wellhead outside of 200 million a day we have on the Whistler pipeline going down to Katy in South Texas. So we really don't have control over a lot of gas. The company's grown through acquisitions. A Lot of times, the gas came dedicated already with no take-in-kind rights for that operator. I think it's certainly possible, Scott, and certainly it's part of our assessment of where we're headed and also ties into this mantra of capital efficient growth or capital efficient maintenance. It's amazing what the organization has done in terms of efficiencies. Three simul-frac fleets have doubled our efficiency on the frac side. And on the drilling side, like you mentioned, the clear fluid drilling system as well as moving on to electrification has reduced costs and cycle times. So I certainly think it's possible, and we continue to see improvements throughout this year and certainly going into our calculus for what does the next few years look like. We'll see. It's still early. So we'll see. I think we're really focused on getting through the rest of this year in a very tight inflationary environment. Yes. Good question, Jeff. I mean we've obviously baked in some inflation into these costs and went into the year at a lower well cost when we went into 2021 and even in the face of an inflationary environment last year. But generally, there are service providers pushing price. And sometimes we decide not to keep working with those particular service providers. So I think our ability to control costs is because we control a lot of the process with our business partners on the service side. We recognize they need to make margin. But if there is another provider that can provide the same service for less cost, we'll go that route. And we've done that a few times this year. So that's helped us control things a little bit. No. Listen, I think we feel fine with everything we have due 2029 or later sitting out there. And if we take care of the 2026 is, which should be in a matter of months, not years, we'll be in a position to have discussions about increasing shareholder returns beyond what we're already doing. No, it's all due to plant turnarounds, right? I mean we put out a slide that explains that 75% to 80% of our flaring is due to downstream issues. And we're trying to push and incentivize our business partners on the midstream side to do better in terms of flaring, sometimes through contracts where we pay them more per Mcf, if take pay less than 1%. But really, timing-wise, Q1, a lot of turnarounds from some of our business partners on the midstream side. There is some seasonality to it, but that's why we push them for more interconnectivity among their peers, so that if their plant goes down, they can send it to another plant or to a peer and we'll still pay them. So part of the whole value chain is we need our friends on the G&T side to work with us here. Well, electrification in the field helps LOE. So electrifying all of our fields is not only environmentally friendly, but also cost friendly, getting rid of infield power generation. But on the frac side and the drilling rig side, moving rigs and frac fleets to electrification would help lower costs on the capital side, but also then lower our combustion percentage of Scope 1 emissions. Yes. Good question, Doug. We raised our cash tax percentage this quarter because we weren't running $100 oil in our initial guidance in February. There's still some protection this year. We do have about $1.5 billion of NOLs that will protect us next year. So we won't be a full cash taxpayer next year in '2023. Some were NOLs that got pushed out, couldn't use it this year, so we've got to use it next year. And then commodity prices stay where they are. Full cash taxpayer by 2024. Yes. I mean partially, right? I think our protection will decrease next year, but there will be some protection and then full cash tax payer in 2024. Yes. I mean, it really depends, right? I mean it depends on what happens in the situation with Russia and Ukraine as it relates to pipe costs, right? We thought pipe costs were going to come down in the back half of the year. It doesn't look like that's going to happen this year. It might happen next year. I mean I think there's a little push/pull, Leo, with this business tends to sort out supply chain issues over time. And as commodity prices stay stronger for longer, some of the tightness will get sorted out. So certainly, I'm not going to make a prediction that 2023 inflation is going to be as much as 2022, but we're certainly seeing inflationary pressures across all the big ticket items right now. And some of that pricing for the big ticket items is incentivizing new builds, which tends to lower prices. So I think there's a little bit of push/pull. Jury's still out on 2023. I think we feel really good about the budget. Obviously, we're on pace for the low end. I think that's going to be tough, but we feel really good about this year's budget. Yes, I'll take the second part first. Certainly, the cash tax guidance would be higher next year if we have these commodity prices.

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. In February, Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. We at Diamondback strongly condemned Russia's actions and aggression. Our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of men, women and children affected by this unjust war. And while we desire a quick and peaceful resolution to this conflict, we recognize that this war could go on for quite some time. We will continue to support the innocent victims of Ukraine just as we did earlier this year, when we announced a $10 million commitment to various non-profit entities providing vital humanitarian support. Russia's actions have plunged the global energy markets into turmoil. As the world and especially our allies in the European Union grapple with the potential loss of a major source of their energy supply and rethink their respective energy policies, this war has magnified the interconnectivity of the global energy equation and the impact post-Cold War globalization has had on all supply chains. It has also reminded the world of the importance of the traditional oil and gas to the global economy as we're witnessing the impact high energy costs can have on the consumer and the economy in real time. As the war in Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions continue, Russia's oil production is expected to be impacted by shut-ins, natural declines, storage limitations and lower exports, creating a global shortage of oil. Over the next few years, we will need to make up for this lost production, and we believe that the U.S. oil and gas industry is best suited to provide the low-cost environmentally-friendly barrels needed to ensure global energy supply. However, today, we are operating in a constrained environment with inflationary pressures continuing to increase across all facets of our business. Also labor and materials shortages are now present across the supply chain. We at Diamondback are fortunate to have secured the necessary equipment, personnel and materials to run our 2022 capital program, but increase in activity now would result in capital efficiency degradation that would not meaningfully contribute to fixing the global supply and demand imbalance in the oil market today. Therefore, Diamondback remains committed to maintaining our current oil production levels of approximately 220,000 net barrels of oil per day. While we believe that efficiently growing our production base is achievable over the long term, we do not feel that today is the appropriate time to begin spending dollars that would not equate to additional barrels into multiple quarters from now. We continue to focus on capital efficiency and strive to operate with the highest level of environmental and social responsibility. At Diamondback, we plan to invest approximately $60 million to reduce our direct emissions and lower our carbon intensity, including ending routine flaring by 2025. This figure does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars we expend to electrify our production fields and to build pipelines to ensure we produce and transport fluid with the lowest emission intensity possible. These investments are not only good for the environment, but also smart economic decisions that we expect to lower our operating costs. By investing in infrastructure in our high activity levels, we now have the ability to run a dedicated electric fleet for the foreseeable future. We've partnered with Halliburton to secure our first electric frac fleet, which will run in our Martin County acreage off power generated from the central location and delivered via existing lines, reducing our Scope 1 emissions profile. This partnership will also lower our cost per foot, primarily due to fuel savings, decrease our footprint on location and increase our operational efficiency as a result of lower maintenance and non-productive time. We expect this fleet to be operational in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we also announced initiatives to reduce our Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions or GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduced methane intensity by at least 70% of from 2019 levels by 2024. In 2021 alone, we reduced our Scope 1 GHG and methane intensities by 15% and 21%, respectively, from the 2020 levels. Lastly, we launched our Net Zero Now strategy under which, as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have zero net Scope 1 GHG emissions as we offset these emissions with certified carbon credits. Moving to first quarter performance. Our production of 223,000 barrels of oil exceeded the high end of our guidance range, creating $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. We were able to keep our capital costs in check, spending $437 million in CapEx during the quarter, nearly hitting the low end of our guidance range of $435 million to $475 million, and pushing our free cash flow for the quarter to $974 million. We returned $555 million of cash back to our stockholders or $3.09 per share representing 57% of Q1 2022 free cash flow and 50% of adjusted free cash flow, which we calculated by adding back the $135 million in cash we used to terminate certain future hedge positions. This return was made up of stock repurchases, the base dividend in our first variable dividend. As we've said in the past, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we stuck with our plan of evaluating our share repurchases just as we would with any acquisition. A buyback must generate a return well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, assuming a reasonable mid-cycle oil price. In the first quarter, our price debt was approximately $60 a barrel, and as such, we were able to take advantage of some of the volatility in the new market and repurchased 57,000 shares at an average price of $117 a share. Through the end of the first quarter, we've spent about $440 million or 22% of the $2 billion program our Board authorized last September. Additionally, we once again increased our growing base dividend, which we view as our primary, constant and predictable form of shareholder returns. It's now at $2.80 a share on an annualized basis, up 17% quarter-over-quarter and approaching our target of $3 a share. We have now increased our base dividend by a quarterly CAGR of over 11% since it was initiated in 2018. Today, this represents a current yield of just over 2%. Finally, with the free cash flow returns through our base dividend and repurchase program does not equal at least 50% of our free cash flow for that particular quarter, and we've committed to make our investors whole by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend and most importantly, allows at least 50% of free cash flow to be returned. For our strategy, we allocated $422 million to our first variable dividend this quarter or $2.35 per share, putting our total dividend payout in the first quarter at $3.05 per share or nearly a 10% total dividend yield. We met our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to our stockholders and use the remaining cash to strengthen our financial and operating position. In the quarter, we fully redeemed $500 million of notes due in 2024 and $1 billion of notes due in 2025. We also took advantage of the flat long end of the curve by pricing $750 million in new 30-year senior notes at 4.25%. This liability management exercise reduced our absolute debt by $750 million, decreased annual interest expense by $20 million, pushed out the average weighted maturity of our debt profile by 5 years and kept our average weighted cost of debt flat. With only one tranche of near-term maturities outstanding, we are pleased with the progress we've made to improve our investment-grade balance sheet and are nearing our leverage target of approximately 1x at $50 oil which would equate to approximately $3.5 billion in absolute debt at the parent level. We also continue to put our cash to work by high grading our existing inventory position through small bolt-on acquisitions. And we are excited about blocking up our reward position with the acquisition we completed in January. This bolt-on added approximately 6,000 net acres in Ward County and gave us an additional 60 long lateral locations with an 85% net revenue interest in a high rate of return area. In fact, we've already begun drilling the position, but do not expect to have production until late this year. As we look to our outlook for the rest of 2022, our simple plan has not changed. Maintained oil production of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day by spending between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. At the current strip pricing, this production and capital spend equates to approximately 400 -- $4.5 billion of free cash flow, which per our returns framework, gives us a minimum of $2.25 billion of cash back to our investors. We're off to a good start for the year, mitigating inflationary pressures while justifying our social and environmental license to operate. We believe our capital discipline and returns profile is still the best near-term path to equity value creation, while our operational execution provides differentiated returns to our shareholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Well, certainly, from a quarterly perspective, from an operational perspective, we're pretty set on this year's plan. And we have the ability, obviously, to ratchet things down, but as I tried to lay out in our prepared remarks, ratcheting things up right now is not really the right answer. If you're asking a question specifically about buybacks, Neal, we're going to stay disciplined in our approach to buying our stock back. When we look at mid-teens returns or mid-cycle pricing, that's really not changing. I think what matters most though, Neal, is that we're returning cash to shareholders, and we're giving our shareholders the flexibility to do with that cash as they see fit. That's kind of how I view the world right now, Neal. Arun, are you on mute? Arun, if I could control the price of stock, it would be a lot higher than it is today, granted. But I can't. But what we can control is how we allocate capital, how we execute in the field, how we can generate more cash per barrels than anyone else. Those are the things that we really can control. It is -- we do hear a lot about this narrative that Diamondback is a serial acquirer, and let me just put it simply. Large-scale M&A today is quite frankly, off the table. We've got nothing on our deal sheet that's considered more than a tuck-in like the one just announced in my prepared remarks. This remains a seller's market, and we're not going to underwrite M&A at today's oil prices, just like we're not going to underwrite repurchasing stocks at today's oil prices. So I hope that's clear in both of those 2 points that I made, Arun. Yes. Let me reiterate that. Large-scale M&A is off the table. I'll reiterate that point. Yes. I think that's a reasonable approach. But Scott, I also think you have to be cognizant of what our industry has done over the last 10 years in respect to share repurchases. We've typically, as an industry, chased the oil price and repurchased shares back all the way to the top. We're trying to be mindful of that and disciplined in our approach. And I've tried to be as articulate as I could about the way that we think about share repurchases as any other form of capital allocation with that mid-cycle oil price. Mid-cycle oil price isn't -- [it's like] oil price, it doesn't change. Now what could change is that as we continue to accumulate cash, that's going to have an influence on our future capital allocation, both in the form of share repurchases and increased variable payouts. Yes, I think there's 2 points. Your first one is correct that capital efficiency does imply that the payout for that investment is much longer, notwithstanding the fact that the production from that, the way we develop these assets with multi-well pads is quarters away. The second thing is, is that in the hyperinflationary environment like we are in the Permian right now, standing up the rig using your example really means that we're, in most instances, we're going to be taking that rig away from somebody else. So -- and that applies to really all services. And -- so if you're looking to increase the total barrel production out of the Permian, you just really need to be reallocating, so it's not really helping the global supply/demand equation because that's really how tight the services are out here today. We've seen in the past in these hyper inflationary environments that supply chains ultimately normalize. But it takes time for that normalization to occur, which is measured in quarters, if not years for it to normalize. And when it does, then you start to have a greater opportunity to grow without degrading your capital efficiency. I think what you're asking us to do is start forecasting 2023 growth rates that we're not really ready to talk about 2023. I think though, Derrick, if you look at the macro uncertainties that are still out there, let me try to enumerate some of those. You've still got Iranian barrels, whether they're going to find a way in the market. You've got Venezuela, you've got Libya, you've got continued a little bit of surplus capacity in the OPEC+. Those are all volumes that can come on to the equation of the supply-demand equation. You've also got the continued demand impacts of COVID, particularly in the Asian markets right now. And then lastly, to say bluntly, the administration's comments are certainly causing a lot of uncertainty in the market, both in the terms of regulatory taxation, legislation and negative rhetoric towards our industry. And that creates uncertainty in our owners', our shareholders' minds about what the future of this industry really is. And so I think this represents on that front, a pretty unique time to have a sober assessment of what an energy policy really needs to look like for the United States, one that recognizes all forms of energy, while at the same time, having aspirational goals about a more sustainable future. And Scott, when you think about the improvements that Kaes just talked about that are operationally and execution focused, those are made irrespective of commodity price or service costs. And what's exciting about those and what I'm so proud of our organization about is those are permanent. Those are permanent savings that go forward. And when you start doing the relative game to Diamondback versus others' performance, that's what creates the spread. And this is not just a recent phenomenon. Our organization, their stock and trade has been these types of incremental improvements year-over-year regardless of the economic or commodity price backdrop. And I think it's fair that we're going to continue to do that. It gets harder in times like today, but it doesn't mean that we still can't find differential ways to do more with less. And the second point is that as we fully embrace the Northern Midland Basin with the assets that we acquired through Guidon and QEP coming on the production mix back half of this year and fully into 2023. Those wells are so good, you will see a natural uptick in capital efficiency because we -- those wells deliver more per dollar spent. And Jeff, those are true strategic comments that Kaes just made. But look, tactically, what we continue to see is our operations organization getting the TD faster on a quarterly basis. And that kind of goes back to the comments I made earlier. This is what we do. So getting the TD faster translates to cost savings that become permanent. Also completing more lateral feet per day as an efficiency gain this year is another one of those tactical things that we're doing that's helping us hold the line on an increasing cost backdrop. So -- and just to emphasize, we always get the question asked, what is it that makes the secret sauce of Diamondback in our low-cost operations as you just pointed out. And it's really not 1 or 2 things. It's really a consistent laser focus on every single decision that we make that spends dollars. And the cumulative effect of that laser-like focus allows Diamondback just not on a quarterly basis, but now almost for a 10-year time period, maintain the lowest cost operations and the best execution out in the Permian. Sure, Nick. Two things. The first comment on disclosure, I appreciate you saying that. Our Board has mandated us to not only be best-in-class on actual performance, but also best-in-class in disclosure. And there's a lot of our organization that is focused on delivering these results, and we're proud to report them. And I think if those who haven't had a chance that are on the call to look at the ESG detail in our investor deck, which is up on our website, I strongly encourage you to do that. The second part of your question, Nick, was gross gas. And that's -- the reason we reported that is because that's a way that you can back calculate and verify our numbers, but that has to do with the acquired volumes. Kaes? And Nick, we view that as a win-win or a lose-lose. So we're not trying to position ourselves as a win versus lose on the G&T side. We know that emissions from the product we produce need to be eliminated and minimized as quickly as we can. And that's the reason that we spend time in conversations like this talking about our G&T business partners as well as including some slides in the ESG detailed part of the deck that highlights what Diamondback was responsible for and what our midstream guys were responsible for both planned and unplanned outages. Yes, Doug, listen, we've tried to outline exactly our thoughts on the rationale behind all of those things. My comments on the stock price is really a function of what I can control and not control, and I can't control the actual market, what the stock is -- what the actual stock price is. We try to be very disciplined and we are very disciplined in the calculus we use to buy anything, whether it's our stock, whether it's acquisitions or whether it's making drill well decisions. And I've tried to outline the mid-cycle oil price of $60 a barrel. I think that could change as we continue to accumulate free cash. Mid-stock oil price won't change, but our ability to buy more shares back will change, but we made a commitment to distribute at least 50% of our free cash flow and other than [ordinate] on the balance sheet, which we said we're not going to do, we're going to hard that commitment and return at least 50%. Look, we will be affected by inflation, no 2 ways about it. But the bet that we've always made here internally is that we will be affected the least of anyone else because of our efficient operations. And you see it in the first quarter of this year, we were all affected by the same inflation, and we were at the low end of our CapEx guide for the quarter. Recognizing that's going to be a challenge to continue that performance, I still bet on our organization to deliver. Thank you again to everyone participating in today's call.

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Diamondback Energy Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you continue to find the stockholders letter that we issued last night, an efficient way to communicate. So obviously a lot of the material is in that stockholders letter. So with that operator, would you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann: Well, good morning, Travis and team. Thanks for the time. Guys, my first question is on Endeavor specifically, just want to go back to this. You all highlighted about 344,000 acres with about 2,300 locations, that compares to 494,000, 3,800 for you all. And I'm just wondering, does this slightly smaller current core footprint provide a material amount of immediate incremental locations, Travis. And I'm just wondering or potential upside and I'm wondering how you would thinking about I know it's still a while until this thing likely closes but how you will attack these assets.\nTravis Stice: Yes, Neal. I mean listen, we wanted to be conservative and how we laid out the inventory counts for both us and them sub 40, I mean I think there's been a lot of aggressive inventory counts put in deals lately. And I think for us to be able to say that combined we have about 12 years of sub 40 breakeven inventory is truly a best-in-class number in North American shale and that's kind of why we put it there. I mean I think generally as with Diamondback's position, there's a lot of inventory that breaks even well above those numbers. I think there's a lot of testing going on throughout the basin. There's probably some zones like the Upper Spraberry that we'd probably call a sub 40 breakeven zone today. But I don't think they're ready to fully put it in the location count. So I think it's just conservatism. And I think on a relative basis not all locations are created equal and within that combined 6,000 location count, there's some that breakeven below 30, right. I mean it's all about what we're developing today and saving the upside for later. And we know that that upside is going to accrue to us with the size of the acreage position pro forma.\nKaes Van't Hof: Neal, just to add to that point if you think about a company's future two things are really important for the oil and gas sector. One is kind of this durable inventory in case just walked you through some numbers there. But it's also the conversion efficiency of that inventory and I think now with the announcement of this Endeavor merger, we're in control of both the numerator and denominator of that ratio. So our durable inventory greatly extends and then our conversion efficiency that we've been known for a long time actually gets to come to bear on a larger asset base. And I think to give you a little bit more color and comfort; we didn't put our thumb on the scale as we looked across the barbed wire fence. And what I mean by that is we simply applied what Diamondback is doing today on drilling and completion and operating wells and then physically adjacent. This case was just explaining, made the assumption that that can be applied across the barbed wire fence. So I wanted to give you a little bit more color there, Neal. Thanks for your question.\nNeal Dingmann: No, I appreciate both and I definitely appreciate the conservatives. And I think your right case has been something inflated. And my second question is on your current Slide 11 of today on the multi-zone development strategy specifically. Really like that you all for 2024 had -- sorry, for 2023 had the average project size of around 24 wells. And I'm just wondering will that be approximately the same this year? And I'm just wondering with that how do you all continue to mitigate the frac hits that seem to plague other operators so much when they do these larger projects?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Well, I mean I think generally Neal; the project size is up, I mean 25 is not an exact number. It's going to be different, different counties where you have different spacing within different zones. We're not -- we don't use a cookie cutter strategy to develop the asset. We use a unique development strategy for each area. I think we've had a lot of experience with practice over the years. I think we've learned and our planning group has gotten significantly better at looking around the corner and seeing what issues might arise. And certainly, there's a benefit of size and scale, right? If we have one of these 24 projects coming on every quarter, well, there's a lot of risk in that one particular project. But here we have four, five, six of these coming on every quarter. And that allows us operational flexibility to move around and plan our business. And that's just one of the other benefits of size and scale that will only be magnified with the potential with the Endeavor merger.\nKaes Van't Hof: And Neal, when you look at our 2024 budget, you kind of see that the capital efficiency shining through because we're essentially maintaining the volumes profile that we had in the fourth quarter, but we're doing so with 10% less CapEx. And as case we're just talking to our development strategy yields the same well performance. So I think as we look across the industry universe, capital efficiency for this year is going to be very, very important. And I like the way that our budget execution is shaping up in terms of that capital efficiency.\nNeal Dingmann: Agreed times, and seems even better next year. Thank you all.\nTravis Stice: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Thanks for taking my questions, Travis, Kaes, and team. I appreciate the time.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I was just curious, Travis, if you could provide an outlook. I know when you announced the Endeavor deal; I think you said that you weren't going to sell anything, obviously, until the deal closes, which makes plenty of prudent sense. But I'm interested just with all of the minority interest that you have in various pipeline investments. How should we think about just where that pipeline cycle is right now relative to investing versus harvesting? Is that something that we might see if we think about the risk for probability around 2024, seeing some of those investments being harvested? Is the market kind of ripe for that right now or you kind of expect these to be more long-term investment harvesting Endeavor?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Dave, I mean, some are -- some are able to be harvested today. Some are probably further down the line. I mean, we've done a pretty good job selling some of these non-core, we call them non-core, but equity method investments over the last 12 months. We sold the Gray Oak Pipeline interest. We sold our interest in the OMOG oil gathering JV. I think it's logical that some of our assets that we can control the sale of will likely pursue a sale, but there's others that we're probably someone who would tag along with a bigger sale, and I can't control when those happen. But it's certainly an asset that we are assets that we have on our side of the ledger that will be used to reduce debt quickly on a scale basis, or through the indefinite merger. So I think that's certainly on the table. I think Travis' point on not having to sell significant assets is important, right? When we structured the cash stock mix of the deal, we didn't want to be a forced seller of assets to pay down debt. And I think we've done that with the mix we presented last week.\nTravis Stice: Yes, I can't emphasize that point enough, David that we're not going to be forced sellers of any of our assets. We're going to be very thoughtful as we move forward post close in looking at monetization strategy for these minority interests, particularly relation to debt reduction. So we'll be very thoughtful and do the right thing.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And just maybe a little bit in the weeds on this one, but the 2024 plan, when you lay out the Midland Basin development, this year maybe coincidentally or not, there's a more -- a little bit more on the margin going to Wolfcamp D and some of the other zones. Is that just more coincidence of geography where you're developing this year and presumably years beyond? Or are there some things that you saw in 2023 that are sort of increasing your confidence of wanting to allocate more capital there and if there's any color you could provide?\nTravis Stice: Yes. I mean I think both from our drill bit and from others drill bit, we've seen really good results in the Wolfcamp D. I think it makes sense to put it into the stack today, maybe not in every situation, but in more and more situations. So more Wolfcamp D in the plan, and then in the other bucket, we have more Upper Spraberry in the plan. So I think generally, if we're able to add these zones to our development plan and see similar productivity per foot, that only extends the inventory duration that we have both on a standalone basis and pro forma with Endeavor. They've been developing a lot more Wolfcamp D than us and we talked a little bit about that last week, but I think it just shows the beneficial nature of the Midland Basin and stack bay that we're adding zones like the Upper Spraberry and the Wolfcamp D that we didn't talk about three, four, five years ago and now becoming core development targets.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. Thanks for doing this. I guess I have a couple pricing related questions, and the first, would love your perspective on just hedging as standalone and then also pro forma once you roll in the Endeavor assets. Historically, you talk about trying to maximize upside exposure while protecting extreme downside. Just curious what that means for you as you think about hedging in 2024.\nTravis Stice: Neil, I mean I think we need to protect our side of the ledger through the period between signing and closing, so we can generate free cash that reduces the cash portion of the purchase price. I think we've done that. We've historically bought funds in the kind of $55 WTI range. We now kind of stepped it up to kind of that $60 range. And we'll probably be a little more hedged on our side between sign and close than we have been in the past, closer to -- I don't know, two-thirds, three quarters hedge, so that we can make sure that, that, that cash is there to reduce the cash portion of purchase price. I think longer-term, it all depends on the strength of the balance sheet and the break-even that we have with our base dividends. We've always kind of tried to buy hedges at kind of 50 to 55. And that protects free cash flow, balance sheet doesn't blow out and the dividends well protected in that extreme downside scenario. So I don't expect us to move to a non-hedging company because we just believe that it's prudent to protect the balance sheet and our base dividend which we see like debt.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just on natural gas. I know it's a smaller part of your economics, but gas prices have been under a lot of pressure. And in the Permian, we've been surprised to see associated gas supply up as much as it is two fees year-over-year. So just your perspective on how the gas market rebalances and the Permian in particular, do you see this as a structural challenge of continued associated supply or as we move towards more oil discipline gas markets can calibrate with it.\nTravis Stice: I think generally, regardless of oil discipline the gas curves in the Permian Basin always exceed expectations. I think we're always pretty conservative on the gas side. And that almost universally beats expectations, which is why you're seeing on a basin level more growth than we all expect almost on an annual basis. So I think that's going to continue, Neil. We don't -- we could run the gas price at zero in the Permian and still make great returns on oil wells. For us personally, we try to protect our gas price by through hedging as well as through some pipeline commitments to get our gas to bigger markets as well as protecting our basis exposure. But generally I think the Permian, even if you stay disciplined on oil, eventually you're going to have to move to gassier zones and there's a lot of gas and associated gas left to be produced in the Permian.\nNeil Mehta: That makes sense. Thanks again.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, gentlemen. Travis, Kaes, I'd like to know if maybe you could walk us through kind of the path to get to the $10 billion net debt target in terms of timing and how do asset sales, would that influence timing of reaching that target?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Arun, I think we kind of laid out in a $75 world generally the two businesses throughout the course of this year will combine to generate about $5 billion of free cash flow. And if we're looking at a late 2024 close, just high level, half that number $2 billion to $2.5 billion will be used to reduce the cash portion of the purchase price. That kind of puts you in the kind of $12 billion of total net debt at close and with the business continue to generate more free cash in 2025, with the numbers we laid out. You could see that $10 billion number by middle of 2025. That excludes any asset sales or acceleration, and I think we try to be an under promise over delivered company, and there's a lot of things that we can do to accelerate that outside of commodity price because I don't think we want to put the entire bet based on commodity price. So we're looking at what's available to sell down in the next couple of months here and beat that target.\nArun Jayaram: Got it. And just maybe a follow-up. If you do plan to do something in the Delaware Basin, would you wait until kind of reaching close on the transaction or talk us through maybe the timing when you would contemplate doing asset sales?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think we're highly focused on deal certainty and getting the deal closed, and we're not going to do anything that derails that process. So I think the Delaware Basin is great cash flow for us, great free cash flow and a very low decline rate. And we've reduced our capital commitments there and necessary wells we need to drill for lease holding purposes. So I think it's a good asset to have for the time being and its good option value over the long run, but certainly not looking to do anything in the near-term.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Arun.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Whitfield: Yes. Good morning, all. Wanted to --\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Wanted to start by really commending you guys for the leadership you're demonstrating on capital discipline, as many of your peers are treating the environment as if it were naturally balanced today.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: With my first question, I wanted to focus on the service environment. In light of the collapse in gas directed activity that is underway now and the preexisting lower utilization rates the service industry experienced last year, is there an opportunity to revisit service prices on some of the higher spec equipment?\nTravis Stice: Yes, Derrick, good question. I think we expect that we'll see some softening in the service market this year if the gas basins do kind of remain muted in their activity levels. We are not -- we don't set the price of the service market. We're price takers. But we'll certainly continue to push on our end on finding the market prices for all of our service lines where we don't have existing commitments in place.\nDerrick Whitfield: Terrific. And as my follow-up, wanted to touch on Endeavor, since you guys have been out meeting with investors since the deal was announced, are there any aspects of the transaction that are underappreciated in your view?\nTravis Stice: I think the first question that came up was on the synergies of the $3 billion worth of synergies, most of those underpinned by our existing cost structure, applied to the Endeavor assets. And so those are usually the entry questions. But once we explained that the cost assumptions that we embedded are the same cost assumptions we're currently doing today, a lot of comfort was gained, and then we went to the more kind of strategic questions with the shareholders. So I think probably the cost efficiencies were the first, and then secondarily, were some of the debt retirement strategies that case just went through were probably the two most topical questions that we dealt with.\nDerrick Whitfield: Terrific. Thanks. Great quarter and update.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Derrick.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I just wanted to come back, you talked earlier about some of these other benches that might work, and it's a question of whether they'll be as productive and efficient or the productivity and efficiency in those benches. Give us an idea of maybe some of the, let's call it science or just applied efforts that you're seeing that can open up some of these other benches. And I'm thinking within your footprint, as well as what will be an expanded footprint here before you're in.\nKaes Van't Hof: Roger, I mean I think for zones like the Wolfcamp D, we've had some testing on our assets, but also seen a lot of results across the fence line. Diamondback doesn't spend a lot of time. We spend a lot of time looking ourselves. We also spend a lot of time looking across the fence line at what other people are doing, either through M&A process or just general competitor analysis. And we've seen that the Wolfcamp D has been very competitive, particularly in that kind of Midland Glasscock County line area. And also, as you get into Southern Martin County, so that's getting more attention. I would say the Upper Spraberry, we've done a lot of work on ourselves, actually, an old energy well drilled in the Upper Spraberry in 2016 or 2017, and we revisited that well recently, last year, and some of the Upper Spraberry wells that we've completed, one in particular is probably one of the best wells in our portfolio. So I'm not ready to say that the Upper Spraberry exists across our entire acreage position, but it's certainly getting more capital and attention this year, and particularly with the co-development strategy and the fact that these zones talk to each other in some form or fashion means we've got to get it now. And so we've added the Upper Spraberry into our kind of Northern Martin County development plan. And I think the results speak for themselves because you haven't seen a degradation in productivity. I think that's the key to this exploration resource expansion story is, if you can expand your resource without impacting productivity, that's a win for our shareholders.\nTravis Stice: Roger, I'll just add a comment from a high-level on what Kaes just mentioned. In my experience, as companies get bigger, the more inwardly focused they become. So they focus more on their own results and less on what others are doing around them. And it's been a hallmark of Diamondback since the very beginning. One, you could say, out of necessity when we first started, but it's been a hallmark of ours to really pay attention to what goes on around us. And so right now, it's culturally ingrained not only to rigorously examine our own internal results, but also spend intellectual capital on looking across the barbed wire fence at what others are doing. And as we move into a much larger position post close, I promise you that culture will stay intact. We will continue to look and find what others are doing potentially better than we are and adopt accordingly.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that clarification. That's my only question. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Roger.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH & Co. Your line is now open.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the time. \nTravis Stice: Hey, Jeoff.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: My first question -- hey, my first question is on the step change in capital efficiency you are looking forward to into 2025. Could you talk more about the pathway there? I know you're already there for the legacy portfolio of, well cost, as you mentioned, Travis, but can you comment maybe on the larger buckets or moving pieces you'll be focusing on the Endeavor side, both in terms of that well cost reduction and in terms of the non-DMC line items that you think about as we shift from this year into next.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Jeoff, I think generally there's two big buckets on the DMC side that we see across fence Endeavor that we'll probably look to put in place with the team there as we start to integrate on the completion side, it's really the SimulFRAC development plan, as well as probably half of that plan being a SimulFRAC e-fleet, which only reduces the cost of the completion side of the business. I don't even think we've modeled the benefits of a much larger supply chain to these numbers. This is just us getting their cost down to our costs on the capital side. So there's probably some upside there at some point. And then on the drilling side, we've been a big proponent of clear fluids not using oil based mud to drill these wells. It saves time and money. That was something we put in place and learned from the QEP team three or four years ago. And so I think that's just a decision to make. That saves significant dollars. And what I'm excited about is to get under the tent with the Endeavor team and learn what they're doing that we can do better, right? I think that's not modeled in this pro forma business. And we've learned something from both energy and QEP are two large mergers that we've done to-date. So I think there's some upside there. But really, all we're doing is looking to put in place what we're doing today on a larger asset base.\nTravis Stice: And, Jeoff, since I spoke just a second ago on some of the cultural elements of Diamondback, another cultural element is when we combine assets in our history, we've done a really good job of checking our egos at the door and finding out what's really working. And it's a culture of seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood. And as Kaes just mentioned, when we put the two companies together, we're really excited about understanding what they do, why they do it, and making -- collectively making improvements both on our side and on the incoming asset side.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Perfect. And then for my follow-up, I wonder if you could just speak to how the philosophy around the balance sheet longer-term will evolve, if at all, once the deal closes. We appreciate the commentary on the path to get to the $10 billion net debt level, but we're just thinking about how the pro forma math continues to push Diamondback to new levels in terms of weight class within the space.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I mean that's a question we got on the road a lot last year, kind of from investors saying, hey, listen, you're in a different weight class now, and you probably need to reassess your long-term leverage profile. And I think that resonated with us and fits with what we're trying to do. I think we eventually want to get to kind of a $6 billion to $8 billion net debt number, keep real cash on the balance sheet. I think the concern that Diamondback is going to go do every deal and use all cash to do deals has probably been removed with this merger. And in my mind, that leaves us flexibility in terms of capital allocation to lean into a buyback in a down cycle or lean into an acquisition in the down cycle and be -- be pro cyclical -- not be pro cyclical in how we look at allocating capital on the repurchase side or the deal side. So long-term, $6 billion to $8 billion would be a good number. If it gets to zero, that'd be great. But I think generally running in that half a turn at strip is a pretty good place to be.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Great. Appreciate the time. I have to turn it back.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Jeoff.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Jeoff.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: All right. Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Last week when you announced the deal, you gave the 2024 and 2025 CapEx pro forma and also the [indiscernible]. It was 2005 the pro forma compared to 2004 with the above say call you wrong number $700 million lower. Can you breakdown that how much relation because you think the antipathy will be lower or that asset because you're not going to grow as fast and how just truly is just --\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Sure, Paul, you kind of cut out a little bit, but I think I get your question. Question is, how do we bridge the gap between the combined 2024 CapEx guide with us and Endeavor separately, and the combined business in 2025, which is down $700-ish million? I would say most of it is running our cost structure on the Endeavor DMC. And so that's basically 175 wells at $1.5 million, $2 million cheaper, it gets you to about $300 million. I think combined business is not going to need as many wells to hit the production number. Endeavor was growing last year. They started slowing down mid-year, but their decline rate is shallowing. So that'll help. Our decline rate continues to shallow. That'll help. I think we're going to allocate capital to the best combined resource probably in North America, which will help. And so that kind of gets you to needing probably 50 less wells at $6 million, $6.5 million a pop. That's about another $300 million. And I think generally we're spending some dollars this year, probably about $50 million on environmental CapEx. That is kind of one-time in nature and will be reduced on our side as well. So you put all that together and that's a very, very capital efficient business in 2025, assuming existing well costs, and that can move around. But that's how we're thinking about 2025. We might have lost Paul. So we'll go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani: Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask about the Endeavor FANG combination here. Do you guys see any tax benefit for the combined entity where you might be able to defer some of the cash tax payments as a result of combining these two companies? Have you had any preliminary look at that?\nKaes Van't Hof: I mean there obviously be some benefit with the cash portion of the transaction and the associated interest expense, but we're continuing to do our combination work. I mean we're a full cash taxpayer, essentially. I mean they're pretty close as well. So I don't think there's going to be too much to do there, Leo, but certainly, the cash piece is going to shield a little bit of taxes on our side.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then just jumping back over to M&A, obviously you guys got the big prize and the Permian, and the market has clearly rewarded the Diamondback shareholders here. As you look at kind of the remaining landscape, do you think there's anything out there left to do that's kind of chunky that would be of interest to FANG? Or is it maybe just kind of more little stuff over the years to kind of tie everything together?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Listen, Leo, we're on the sidelines here. We're fully focused on getting this deal closed as soon as possible and we can assess the landscape when that happens. I mean I am confident that the landscape will look different whenever that time does come.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Thanks.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Leo.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJohn Abbott: My question is, does that have any impact on integration, planning, or does that go ahead anyway.\nKaes Van't Hof: Hey, Doug, you have to speak up.\nJohn Abbott: This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Apologies I was on mute. Just one more, just one question going back to Paul's question on the difference in CapEx between 2024 and 2025. That's about $725 million. And then you talk about the $550 million in synergies. So when we think about that $725 million is there an addition on top of that, as were we sort of thinking to 2025? Just sort of trying to reconcile the two numbers?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think the difference between the two numbers is really activity between the $550 million and $725 million, right? The combined business has less activity in 2025 versus 2024, which is helping, but we kind of see the $550 million as more of a longer-term run rate, John.\nJohn Abbott: Appreciate it. And that's really it at this point in time, but thank you very much for taking our questions.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, CEO for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Great. Thank you. I really appreciate everyone listening in this morning and asking questions. And if there's any follow-up, just reach out to us and we'll address them then. Thank you. And you all have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Neal, just to add to that point if you think about a company's future two things are really important for the oil and gas sector. One is kind of this durable inventory in case just walked you through some numbers there. But it's also the conversion efficiency of that inventory and I think now with the announcement of this Endeavor merger, we're in control of both the numerator and denominator of that ratio. So our durable inventory greatly extends and then our conversion efficiency that we've been known for a long time actually gets to come to bear on a larger asset base. And I think to give you a little bit more color and comfort; we didn't put our thumb on the scale as we looked across the barbed wire fence. And what I mean by that is we simply applied what Diamondback is doing today on drilling and completion and operating wells and then physically adjacent. This case was just explaining, made the assumption that that can be applied across the barbed wire fence. So I wanted to give you a little bit more color there, Neal. Thanks for your question. And Neal, when you look at our 2024 budget, you kind of see that the capital efficiency shining through because we're essentially maintaining the volumes profile that we had in the fourth quarter, but we're doing so with 10% less CapEx. And as case we're just talking to our development strategy yields the same well performance. So I think as we look across the industry universe, capital efficiency for this year is going to be very, very important. And I like the way that our budget execution is shaping up in terms of that capital efficiency. Yes, Dave, I mean, some are -- some are able to be harvested today. Some are probably further down the line. I mean, we've done a pretty good job selling some of these non-core, we call them non-core, but equity method investments over the last 12 months. We sold the Gray Oak Pipeline interest. We sold our interest in the OMOG oil gathering JV. I think it's logical that some of our assets that we can control the sale of will likely pursue a sale, but there's others that we're probably someone who would tag along with a bigger sale, and I can't control when those happen. But it's certainly an asset that we are assets that we have on our side of the ledger that will be used to reduce debt quickly on a scale basis, or through the indefinite merger. So I think that's certainly on the table. I think Travis' point on not having to sell significant assets is important, right? When we structured the cash stock mix of the deal, we didn't want to be a forced seller of assets to pay down debt. And I think we've done that with the mix we presented last week. Yes, Arun, I think we kind of laid out in a $75 world generally the two businesses throughout the course of this year will combine to generate about $5 billion of free cash flow. And if we're looking at a late 2024 close, just high level, half that number $2 billion to $2.5 billion will be used to reduce the cash portion of the purchase price. That kind of puts you in the kind of $12 billion of total net debt at close and with the business continue to generate more free cash in 2025, with the numbers we laid out. You could see that $10 billion number by middle of 2025. That excludes any asset sales or acceleration, and I think we try to be an under promise over delivered company, and there's a lot of things that we can do to accelerate that outside of commodity price because I don't think we want to put the entire bet based on commodity price. So we're looking at what's available to sell down in the next couple of months here and beat that target. Yes. I think we're highly focused on deal certainty and getting the deal closed, and we're not going to do anything that derails that process. So I think the Delaware Basin is great cash flow for us, great free cash flow and a very low decline rate. And we've reduced our capital commitments there and necessary wells we need to drill for lease holding purposes. So I think it's a good asset to have for the time being and its good option value over the long run, but certainly not looking to do anything in the near-term. Thanks, Arun. Thanks, Derrick. Roger, I mean I think for zones like the Wolfcamp D, we've had some testing on our assets, but also seen a lot of results across the fence line. Diamondback doesn't spend a lot of time. We spend a lot of time looking ourselves. We also spend a lot of time looking across the fence line at what other people are doing, either through M&A process or just general competitor analysis. And we've seen that the Wolfcamp D has been very competitive, particularly in that kind of Midland Glasscock County line area. And also, as you get into Southern Martin County, so that's getting more attention. I would say the Upper Spraberry, we've done a lot of work on ourselves, actually, an old energy well drilled in the Upper Spraberry in 2016 or 2017, and we revisited that well recently, last year, and some of the Upper Spraberry wells that we've completed, one in particular is probably one of the best wells in our portfolio. So I'm not ready to say that the Upper Spraberry exists across our entire acreage position, but it's certainly getting more capital and attention this year, and particularly with the co-development strategy and the fact that these zones talk to each other in some form or fashion means we've got to get it now. And so we've added the Upper Spraberry into our kind of Northern Martin County development plan. And I think the results speak for themselves because you haven't seen a degradation in productivity. I think that's the key to this exploration resource expansion story is, if you can expand your resource without impacting productivity, that's a win for our shareholders. Thanks, Roger. Yes, Jeoff, I think generally there's two big buckets on the DMC side that we see across fence Endeavor that we'll probably look to put in place with the team there as we start to integrate on the completion side, it's really the SimulFRAC development plan, as well as probably half of that plan being a SimulFRAC e-fleet, which only reduces the cost of the completion side of the business. I don't even think we've modeled the benefits of a much larger supply chain to these numbers. This is just us getting their cost down to our costs on the capital side. So there's probably some upside there at some point. And then on the drilling side, we've been a big proponent of clear fluids not using oil based mud to drill these wells. It saves time and money. That was something we put in place and learned from the QEP team three or four years ago. And so I think that's just a decision to make. That saves significant dollars. And what I'm excited about is to get under the tent with the Endeavor team and learn what they're doing that we can do better, right? I think that's not modeled in this pro forma business. And we've learned something from both energy and QEP are two large mergers that we've done to-date. So I think there's some upside there. But really, all we're doing is looking to put in place what we're doing today on a larger asset base. Yes, I mean that's a question we got on the road a lot last year, kind of from investors saying, hey, listen, you're in a different weight class now, and you probably need to reassess your long-term leverage profile. And I think that resonated with us and fits with what we're trying to do. I think we eventually want to get to kind of a $6 billion to $8 billion net debt number, keep real cash on the balance sheet.

And in my mind, that leaves us flexibility in terms of capital allocation to lean into a buyback in a down cycle or lean into an acquisition in the down cycle and be -- be pro cyclical -- not be pro cyclical in how we look at allocating capital on the repurchase side or the deal side. So long-term, $6 billion to $8 billion would be a good number. If it gets to zero, that'd be great. But I think generally running in that half a turn at strip is a pretty good place to be. Thanks, Jeoff. Yes. Sure, Paul, you kind of cut out a little bit, but I think I get your question.

So that'll help. Our decline rate continues to shallow. That'll help. I think we're going to allocate capital to the best combined resource probably in North America, which will help. And so that kind of gets you to needing probably 50 less wells at $6 million, $6.5 million a pop. That's about another $300 million. And I think generally we're spending some dollars this year, probably about $50 million on environmental CapEx. That is kind of one-time in nature and will be reduced on our side as well. So you put all that together and that's a very, very capital efficient business in 2025, assuming existing well costs, and that can move around. But that's how we're thinking about 2025. We might have lost Paul. So we'll go to the next question. I mean there obviously be some benefit with the cash portion of the transaction and the associated interest expense, but we're continuing to do our combination work. I mean we're a full cash taxpayer, essentially. I mean they're pretty close as well.

I mean I am confident that the landscape will look different whenever that time does come. Hey, Doug, you have to speak up. Yes. I think the difference between the two numbers is really activity between the $550 million and $725 million, right? The combined business has less activity in 2025 versus 2024, which is helping, but we kind of see the $550 million as more of a longer-term run rate, John."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you continue to find the stockholders letter that we issued last night, an efficient way to communicate. So obviously a lot of the material is in that stockholders letter. So with that operator, would you please open the line for questions? Yes, Neal. I mean listen, we wanted to be conservative and how we laid out the inventory counts for both us and them sub 40, I mean I think there's been a lot of aggressive inventory counts put in deals lately. And I think for us to be able to say that combined we have about 12 years of sub 40 breakeven inventory is truly a best-in-class number in North American shale and that's kind of why we put it there. I mean I think generally as with Diamondback's position, there's a lot of inventory that breaks even well above those numbers. I think there's a lot of testing going on throughout the basin. There's probably some zones like the Upper Spraberry that we'd probably call a sub 40 breakeven zone today. But I don't think they're ready to fully put it in the location count. So I think it's just conservatism. And I think on a relative basis not all locations are created equal and within that combined 6,000 location count, there's some that breakeven below 30, right. I mean it's all about what we're developing today and saving the upside for later. And we know that that upside is going to accrue to us with the size of the acreage position pro forma. Yes. Well, I mean I think generally Neal; the project size is up, I mean 25 is not an exact number. It's going to be different, different counties where you have different spacing within different zones. We're not -- we don't use a cookie cutter strategy to develop the asset. We use a unique development strategy for each area. I think we've had a lot of experience with practice over the years. I think we've learned and our planning group has gotten significantly better at looking around the corner and seeing what issues might arise. And certainly, there's a benefit of size and scale, right? If we have one of these 24 projects coming on every quarter, well, there's a lot of risk in that one particular project. But here we have four, five, six of these coming on every quarter. And that allows us operational flexibility to move around and plan our business. And that's just one of the other benefits of size and scale that will only be magnified with the potential with the Endeavor merger. Thank you. Thank you, David. Yes, I can't emphasize that point enough, David that we're not going to be forced sellers of any of our assets. We're going to be very thoughtful as we move forward post close in looking at monetization strategy for these minority interests, particularly relation to debt reduction. So we'll be very thoughtful and do the right thing. Yes. I mean I think both from our drill bit and from others drill bit, we've seen really good results in the Wolfcamp D. I think it makes sense to put it into the stack today, maybe not in every situation, but in more and more situations. So more Wolfcamp D in the plan, and then in the other bucket, we have more Upper Spraberry in the plan. So I think generally, if we're able to add these zones to our development plan and see similar productivity per foot, that only extends the inventory duration that we have both on a standalone basis and pro forma with Endeavor. They've been developing a lot more Wolfcamp D than us and we talked a little bit about that last week, but I think it just shows the beneficial nature of the Midland Basin and stack bay that we're adding zones like the Upper Spraberry and the Wolfcamp D that we didn't talk about three, four, five years ago and now becoming core development targets. Neil, I mean I think we need to protect our side of the ledger through the period between signing and closing, so we can generate free cash that reduces the cash portion of the purchase price. I think we've done that. We've historically bought funds in the kind of $55 WTI range. We now kind of stepped it up to kind of that $60 range. And we'll probably be a little more hedged on our side between sign and close than we have been in the past, closer to -- I don't know, two-thirds, three quarters hedge, so that we can make sure that, that, that cash is there to reduce the cash portion of purchase price. I think longer-term, it all depends on the strength of the balance sheet and the break-even that we have with our base dividends. We've always kind of tried to buy hedges at kind of 50 to 55. And that protects free cash flow, balance sheet doesn't blow out and the dividends well protected in that extreme downside scenario. So I don't expect us to move to a non-hedging company because we just believe that it's prudent to protect the balance sheet and our base dividend which we see like debt. I think generally, regardless of oil discipline the gas curves in the Permian Basin always exceed expectations. I think we're always pretty conservative on the gas side. And that almost universally beats expectations, which is why you're seeing on a basin level more growth than we all expect almost on an annual basis. So I think that's going to continue, Neil. We don't -- we could run the gas price at zero in the Permian and still make great returns on oil wells. For us personally, we try to protect our gas price by through hedging as well as through some pipeline commitments to get our gas to bigger markets as well as protecting our basis exposure. But generally I think the Permian, even if you stay disciplined on oil, eventually you're going to have to move to gassier zones and there's a lot of gas and associated gas left to be produced in the Permian. Thanks, Neil. Thanks, Arun. Good morning, Derrick. Thank you, Derrick. Yes, Derrick, good question. I think we expect that we'll see some softening in the service market this year if the gas basins do kind of remain muted in their activity levels. We are not -- we don't set the price of the service market. We're price takers. But we'll certainly continue to push on our end on finding the market prices for all of our service lines where we don't have existing commitments in place. I think the first question that came up was on the synergies of the $3 billion worth of synergies, most of those underpinned by our existing cost structure, applied to the Endeavor assets. And so those are usually the entry questions. But once we explained that the cost assumptions that we embedded are the same cost assumptions we're currently doing today, a lot of comfort was gained, and then we went to the more kind of strategic questions with the shareholders. So I think probably the cost efficiencies were the first, and then secondarily, were some of the debt retirement strategies that case just went through were probably the two most topical questions that we dealt with. Thanks, Derrick. Good morning, Roger. Roger, I'll just add a comment from a high-level on what Kaes just mentioned. In my experience, as companies get bigger, the more inwardly focused they become. So they focus more on their own results and less on what others are doing around them. And it's been a hallmark of Diamondback since the very beginning. One, you could say, out of necessity when we first started, but it's been a hallmark of ours to really pay attention to what goes on around us. And so right now, it's culturally ingrained not only to rigorously examine our own internal results, but also spend intellectual capital on looking across the barbed wire fence at what others are doing. And as we move into a much larger position post close, I promise you that culture will stay intact. We will continue to look and find what others are doing potentially better than we are and adopt accordingly. Thanks, Roger. Hey, Jeoff. And, Jeoff, since I spoke just a second ago on some of the cultural elements of Diamondback, another cultural element is when we combine assets in our history, we've done a really good job of checking our egos at the door and finding out what's really working. And it's a culture of seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood. And as Kaes just mentioned, when we put the two companies together, we're really excited about understanding what they do, why they do it, and making -- collectively making improvements both on our side and on the incoming asset side. Thanks, Jeoff. Good morning, Paul. Thanks, Leo. Thanks, John. Great. Thank you. I really appreciate everyone listening in this morning and asking questions. And if there's any follow-up, just reach out to us and we'll address them then. Thank you. And you all have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Steven. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy\u2019s third quarter 2023 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in Company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam, and good morning to everyone. As Adam mentioned, we released a Shareholder Letter last night that contains much of the narrative we hope to cover again this morning. So with that, we'll just open the lines up for question. Operator?\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNeal Dingmann: Morning, Travis and team. Thanks for the time and another nice quarter. Travis, my first question is on capital allocation specifically. Several quarters ago, you suggested you all would return to more of a production growth type model, I'd call it. And I think you've mentioned when the macro fundamental supported. I'm just wondering, do you believe we're close to that scenario and wondering, why do you believe the continued high free cash flow payout is warranted?\nTravis D. Stice: Yes. Neal, that's a good question. Look, the world is certainly in a mess right now across any number of fronts. All of which could potentially move the markets both positively and negatively, both with the supply disruption or even a demand destruction as well too. So, obviously, we can't control any of those items. Again, we simply respond to our shareholders that own our company. That right now return a shareholder model versus a growth model, as we've intimated our plans as we look forward into next year again, look for real efficient capital allocation and as an output of that capital allocation which expect low-single-digit type volume growth. Again, not as an input, but what results from an efficient capital allocation program.\nNeal Dingmann: Got it. That makes sense in this environment. And then secondly on your development, couldn't help but notice the new slides on slides 10 and 11 highlighted the efficient execution and then, differentiated development. My question is, does most of your remaining Midland inventory lend to the 24 average, wells per project size that you mentioned. And then I'm just wondering, could you speak to where the largest cost efficiencies continue to come from on these projects?\nTravis D. Stice: Sure. On the development strategy, over time slide, which is slide 11 for those of you that are looking at it online. We tried to demonstrate our evolution from 2015 to today, and we said average wells per project is about 24 wells. I think generally that applies across our Midland Basin. However, not all deposits are equal in terms of the way the shale were laid down across the Midland Basin. So, there will be areas where we can do slightly more than 24 wells, and then areas also where we'll do slightly less than 24 wells, which usually translates to one or two wells less per shale interval. So again, it's a general representation showing the development over time. But that's a good that's a good summary. And then, let's see. What was your second question?\nNeal Dingmann: Just on the cost, on the cost, I know, Kaes and I've talked about, I mean, is it just on, I know you have lower casing just different, sort of raw material costs, but is there, is there other, areas in that that larger projects that are causing these, when you see that, that well productivity chart on the right, sort of what's driving the lower cost efficiencies there?\nTravis D. Stice: Yes, certainly. Again, referencing back to slide 10, we've laid out the biggest elements of cost savings, cost components, and the reductions over time. And again, as you pointed out, it's casing to down 20% or so. It's really, as you look into next year, we feel more of a kind of a steady state run rate on our cost. There'll be some puts and takes on both sides of the equation. Kaes, do you want to add anything?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean, I think the biggest benefit to the large scale development, Neal, is the consistency of running the rigs in the same spot for a long period of time. But, on the frac side is where we save the most money from a capital perspective, because we're doing -- in some cases, two SimulFRAC crews on the same site at the same time. So, you're saving essentially, $250,000 - $300,000 a well from SimulFRAC. And now we have two of those fleets or e-fleets that run-off lean gas that save kind of another $200,000 - $250,000 of well. So, now this large scale development kind of ties to the longer cycle nature of our business, and that also means we don't want to change the plan every move in oil price. And so, we've had a consistent plan here for a few years now, and the output of that is consistent results on the well productivity per foot.\nNeal Dingmann: Thank you both.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Neal.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs & Co. Your line is open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thanks, guys, and appreciate the helpful letter and the time today. Travis, why don't we start on return of capital as a topic talked about this in the letter of, you wanting to air on the side of caution as it relates to, buying back stock to avoid repurchasing pro-cyclically and as a result, leaned into the variable dividend in the last quarter. Can you talk about, the way that you're approaching this and how that should inform the way we think about, the split between buybacks and dividends going forward?\nTravis D. Stice: So, Neil, our main focus remains a sustainable in growing base dividend that we think represents the most efficient way for our shareholders to understand what our shareholder return program looks like. Following that is the share repurchase program, which we laid out the -- what we've done in the third quarter in so far in the fourth quarter. And then we honor our commitment to return at least 75% of our free cash flow by making our shareholders hold in the form of variable, which we've seen we did this year. I think the most important thing is when you talk about share repurchases is that you need to have some discipline around that because in my experience, lack of discipline leads to chasing stock repurchases all the way to the top of the cycle. So, we like most of our capital allocation decisions, actually like all of our capital allocation decisions, we hold ourselves accountable to some form of rigorous analytics, and in this case, we continue to run a NAV value at mid cycle oil prices, which is $60 oil, and calculate oil price or calculate stock price, and depending on where our stock is trading relative to that calculation, we either buy more of in the further dislocation we get from that, we buy, we increase or if not then we pivot to a share repurchase -- or to a variable dividend like we did this time around. So, again, it just it's based dividend. Its share repurchases with a degree of caution in a pro-cyclical environment and then honoring our commitment to the form of a variable dividend.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That, that's really helpful. And the follow-up is just on non-core asset sales. You've done a good job of exceeding your target. Can you talk a little bit about the Deep Blue Midland Basin and JV, and then not only in terms of the proceeds, but what does it mean for your go-forward cost structure, as we think about modeling the impacts through 2024?\nTravis D. Stice: Yes. Good question, Neil. The Deep Blue JV was a very big deal for us. It took a long time to pull together. We had built a significant amount of midstream infrastructure over the years and spent a lot of capital doing it. And, we felt it was an opportune time to monetize that in the hands of who we see as operational experts in Deep Blue and the Five Point team. I think they have already proven to have commercial success with third-parties where maybe if you\u2019ll the Diamondback business card, you weren't going have the same type of commercial success. I think that sector is certainly ripe for consolidation as well. And I think they're the experts that can get that done. So, that's kind of why we retained the 30% equity interest in the business. We're very confident that they're going to be able to grow the business and generate a good return for our shareholders. Outside of the $500 million of proceeds we got in which is the big winner. There will be some impacts to our cost structure. I would say generally, LOE is going to be up about 8% to 10% versus prior as a company. And then we'll have a lot less midstream CapEx as we don't have very many operated midstream assets. And that'll be kind of canceled out by slightly higher well costs $10 to $20 a foot, depending on the area, as we buy water from the JV. So, all-in-all, we sold the business for a much higher multiple than we trade. And then we're excited to see what they can do in terms of creating value for the 30% that we're retaining.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, team.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Morning, Travis and Kaes team, and Danny. Thanks for taking my questions. Travis, I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the remarks in the Shareholder Letter on being an acquirer and exploiter and just maybe putting in context sort of how robust you think that opportunity set is right now, just given the cycles in the business and some of the PE cycles that have gone through the Permian right now?\nTravis D. Stice: Yes, David. And I appreciate you referencing the Shareholder Letter. I tried to address that head-on. I think just in a more macro sense, we'll always do what's right for our shareholders. I mean, we've got now over a decade of what I think is demonstrating doing the right thing for our shareholders. But, we remain laser focused on delivering on our business plan, and you're right, we have built this Company through an acquirer and exposure strategy. But I think as investors are really starting to understand, we have such a high quality inventory right now, that the bar is pretty high for additional opportunities to add to our inventory that meets those the criteria that we laid out in our Shareholder Letter would sound industrial logics and being able or -- logic and being able to compete for capital right away and then being accretive on those financial measures that are so important to all of this. So, there has been a lot of private equity roll through. And I think, based on lack of our name on those, it just tells you where we view those assets relative to our inventory. Like I said, I'm really pleased with the quality of our inventory. And I think, we're executing on that in a flawless manner.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate that. And then, maybe just for Kaes is just, the DUC backlog is built, I guess, up to a 150 by the end of the year. I think you guys talked about low-single-digit organic oil growth for next year. One, I just wanted to confirm, I guess, if that oil growth is reflecting the benefit of the increased royalty interest through the VNOM acquisition or Viper acquisition rather or if that's -- how we should be thinking about that growth rate and then just in concert with the DUC backlog are -- is it -- should we think about that flexibility, especially in this pricing environment just based on frac crew availability, or is that really just like a capital allocation decision?\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. I'll hit the organic growth comment first. Certainly we excluding the Viper deal, we expect it to grow organically. And we expect to grow organically in 2024. I think, the Viper deal provides a little bit of a jump start here in Q4, but think the team's expecting to grow off that number to steady state throughout the next year, just due to the quality of what we've got in front of us. And, on the DUC side we were kind of operating pretty close to the rigs on the completion crews and really needed some flexibility here and that the drilling team's done a really good job this year getting ahead of plan, drilling more wells than expected sooner. With these large pads and large projects you really want to have the flexibility to be able to go somewhere if something bad happens and, that DUC backlog allows that. So I think, 150 plus or minus 10 or 20 wells either way is a pretty good number for our run rate. And, we've kind of set the stage for a world where we run for the SimulFRAC crews consistently throughout the year, they each do about 80 wells a year. And, in our mind that's kind of the most capital efficient development plan we can imagine here. So, that's our backlog, just let Danny sleep a little better at night. And, allows for some flexibility heading into next year.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good deal. Thanks for the responses.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital. Your line is now open.\nScott Hanold: Yes, thanks. If I could go back to the M&A topic a little bit differently. When Kaes, Travis, when you step back and think about like where Diamondback's inventory depth is and to be a long-term successful large scale play in the Midland. Like, do you think that more large scale M&A is necessary over time? And just remind us like where you think your inventory life is, and where ideally would you like it to be?\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. I mean, I don't think it's necessary, Scott. I think we've positioned the business through both large scale and small scale M&A. It's just kind of been in our DNA for the last 10 years. I'd kind of go back to thinking about what positions in North American shale or in the Midland Basin would be envy, and there are very few particularly with where we sit today and the amount of deals we've done over the years. So, I think it's a fortunate spot to be in with the inventory duration and depth that we have relative to what's out there. I just think Travis's comment is really about knowing who you are. And this Company has been a, acquirer and exploit company that's been able to execute on acquiring and exploiting assets through our low cost structure. And, generally we have had a philosophy that the low cost operator in a commodity based business wins. And, our cost structure is what has created this business to be as big as it is today. Travis, do you want anything to that?\nTravis D. Stice: I think that makes sense. We've talked about the high bar for entry into the Diamondback portfolio. And, there's just, that's just how we view it. And, we're very proud of the inventory we have. And I think what goes along with that durable inventory is how we convert that inventory into cash flow. And again, you see this quarter flawless execution from our teams in converting rock into cash flow. And that's, our cost structure is enviable. Our execution prowess is unmatched. And that makes that makes a big difference when you talk about a profitable oil and gas company like that.\nScott Hanold: Yes. And then and just as part of that was the inventory life kind of conversation more of like where you think you're at now and what do you think is ideal?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean, I think I kind of said this that we put our next five years up with anybody in North America, and I still stand by that. I think we have another solid, five or ten years beyond that. It's very logical that at some point you're going to have to move down the quality of your inventory. We don't see that in the forward plan today, but if we retain our cost structure and our ability to drill wells $1 million or $1.5 million or $2 million cheaper. Well, as the shale cost curve goes up, we continue to stay at the low end of that cost curve. It's kind of been our mantra for 10 years now. And we started with 50,000 acres an hour at [55000] (ph). And, as that culture and mantra has not changed. And I think that sets us up well for a world, where assets are getting more and more sparse.\nScott Hanold: Got it. Understood. And if I could follow-up on our conversation we had last night, just on the shareholder returns and stock buybacks. And I thought it was an conversation we had on just where it FANG\u2019s intrinsic value is now and the opportunity to grow that over time. And so, like when you step back and think about the current oil market, obviously, we're in a little bit more heightened oil price versus your intrinsic point. But, like as you see yourself progressing over the next years, I mean, does it seem to make sense that buying back stock at higher prices in this heightened market relative to what you did in the past still make sense from a value return standpoint?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, it's really all about value, like we talked about last night, if you run your business conservatively from an oil price perspective and accrete value quarterly at $75 to $80, $85 crude, if you're actually building equity value on a conservative basis, right. I kind of said last night to you that, I think generally if you run a quarter like last quarter versus the $60 base case, you're basically building $3, $4 a share of extra intrinsic value. And I think that's what we've done here over the last couple of years in this up-cycle. And, as Travis mentioned, we want to be conservative when buying back stock. We think capital is precious and capital discipline not just applies in the field, but it applies, to returning capital to shareholders. And that's why we've had this flexible return of capital program since we put it in place two and a half years ago.\nScott Hanold: Thank you.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. For your question one moment for our next. Next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I think I'll skip the obligatory share repo versus a variable dividend question for a moment, and just go back to the operational aspects. So, can you give us an idea, as you mentioned, the sort of accreting value into the shares through operations, what we should be looking at over the next, say, 24 to 36 months for what else you can do operationally that'll accrete value. And thinking that we're not going to have some of the asset sales that have been going on that have certainly helped on the sort of cash flow generation assets?\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. That's a good question, Roger. No, I think it's interesting, we put it to slide in, slide 10 about operational track record in prowess and, I think we sat in this room two or three years ago saying, hey, the drilling guys, they're near the asymptotic curve of drilling these wells. Well, you look at the top left of that chart, they're still taking days out of the average well on a much bigger program, right. These guys are drilling 280 wells in the Midland Basin, two, three, four days faster than they were even two years ago. And, the culture that we built accretes that value to our shareholders. It's not something we model, but it certainly comes our way. So in the field, I think that's part of what is coming our way. I also think, generally we've tested some other zones in the Midland Basin that looked very, very good. We got a couple Upper Spraberry tests in the Northern Midland Basin that looked very good relative to our Middle Sprague Road, Jo Mill development. So, we're excited about that. I think the Wolfcamp D in the Midland Basin is starting to become a primary development zone in some of the basin. And, certainly, there's a lot of excitement about deeper zones in the Midland Basin as well the Barnett and the Woodford that we're on the testing. So I think, the Midland Basin, the [stacked bay] (ph) and the amount of oil in place, just provides a lot of opportunity for future value to accrete to our shareholders that they don't know about today. Travis, do you want anything to add?\nTravis D. Stice: Yes. Roger, if you back cast 10 years ago, when we first started this, we're still drilling a few vertical wells. And, I put in the letter that we released last night, just a couple of data points on a 7500 foot lateral well, which has a total depth, total major depth of about what we were drilling vertically when we started. But drilling, we drill those 7500 foot lateral wells in under four days. And when we started, we were drilling it, sometimes it'd take us over 24, 25 days to get down to that same measured depth vertically. And so, probably the most repeated question that we get, is what is the secret sauce, what is the magic that Diamondback does that allows execution quarter-over-quarter to just far exceed the competition. It's essentially, the same rock and the same tools, but the culture that we built here at this Company with that laser focus on the conversion process of rock into cash flow, is felt by every employee in the Company. And when you have everyone leaning in the same direction on cost and efficiency, as long as we can continue to give them good rock, they're going to generate the outstanding results that we're known for. So, I know that's a little bit of motherhood and apple pie, but it's -- I'm really proud of the organization for -- through all the cycles we've been through over the last 10 years, what hasn't changed is an unrelenting focus on delivering, best-in-class execution, highest margin barrels at the lowest cost.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that. I'm not going to be in between motherhood and apple pie here in the U.S. So, I'll turn it back. Thanks.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Alright. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning, all and thanks for all the incremental disclosures this quarter.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Derrick.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Building on an earlier question, how should we think about 2024 maintenance capital, run rate, assuming the benefit of deflation and your current operational efficiencies?\nKaes Van't Hof: That's a good question, Derrick. And I'd probably say that maintenance CapEx would be $100 million to $200 million cheaper, 30 wells maybe, Danny.\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. I think, we're kind of looking at it, like, our maintenance our case for 2024 is kind of a maintenance activity case. So, flat activity outfits a little bit of a growth, but, if we were to try and maintain a flat production profile, you'd probably be in the line of 20 to 30 less wells in the year.\nTravis D. Stice: You know, Derrick, while you're on that topic of maintenance CapEx, I might just point you to slide seven, we've had that slide in there a couple of times, but it shows maintenance CapEx, which Danny just defined, is kind of holding, the fourth quarter production flat for next year. And I just want to show you what our breakeven prices are on that slide, $32 a barrel to cover maintenance cap, maintenance CapEx, $40 barrel to cover our base dividend. So, that kind of goes back to my cost and execution comments that ultimately translate into a very protected business model even at low commodity prices.\nDerrick Whitfield: That's great. And as my follow-up, with respect to your non-core asset sales, how should we think about the market value of what's being retained by Diamondback and how that will be realized over time now that you've exceeded your disposal target?\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. Good question, Derrick. We do lay out some of our remaining JVs that we have on slide 26. Yes, I think some of those logically are monetized at some point in the coming years. I don't think we're in a huge rush to do so, but, in most cases, we're kind of a non-op partner to these JVs that do have a ton of value just not something that we can commit to monetizing today.\nDerrick Whitfield: All done, guys. Thanks for your time.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Derrick.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Derrick.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Kevin MacCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\nKevin MacCurdy: Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary on industry consolidation. Digging into your cost structure comments a little bit, now that you've had FireBird and Lario in house for almost a year, can you comment on the level of cost synergies you've created in those transactions or maybe just share with us your analysis of Diamondback costs versus peers. I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of uplift assets get when they're incorporating it to Diamondback in your cost structure?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean, that's a good question, Kevin. I hate to say it, but we didn't win those deals because we were buddies and been left and other people. So, I think we bid the most, but we bid the most because we could underwrite it with the lowest cost, right. At the time, I think some Lario well costs were near $8.5 million, $9.5 million for 10,000 foot lateral, and we were drilling them at [$6.5 million to $7 million] (ph). And so that's kind of been our mantra for a long time. I would just say generally if you split the two deals out, Lario was an execution deal because we knew we could drill those units cheaper, and execute on large scale development. I would say, FireBird is more of a technical deal. And, we had a technical view of that particular area that the basin could move further west, particularly in the northern top portion there'd be some multi-zone development that looks really good. I think we're conservative on the multi-zone potential of the central block. And now feel a little more confident about the Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry and maybe being wind wrapped in that area. And also, with the benefit of that block being so contiguous, we're able to bring a 15,000 foot lateral manufacturing process to that area. So, now we underwrite these deals at our cost structure, which if you look at our cost structure versus others that means we should get more of those properties at the same rate of return because of our ability to execute.\nKevin MacCurdy: Great. That's only one for me. Appreciate taking my question.\nTravis D. Stice: Good question, Kevin.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon of TPH & Co. Your line is now open.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions.\nTravis D. Stice: Morning, Jeff.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: First, one is on the ops and capital allocation side. If you can just speak to any more detail on next year's plan in terms of where you might focus within the Midland Basin, both in terms of geography, but also maybe just less active zones in terms of industry activity that you may be testing more, and if you could speak maybe a bit more onto some of that laterally in the commentary in terms of how that might evolve over the near-term program? That would be helpful as well.\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. Jeff, with these longer cycle projects we have a pretty good view of what the projects look like coming up here in 2024. I'd say generally we're going to be in the range of 11,000 feet average lateral length, probably maybe even a little bit more than that. I would say it's also a very heavy, Martin County development year for us, which is great, large scale, multi-zone development, and some of the best undeveloped resource remaining in the Midland Basin. I'd say, from a testing perspective some more wells can be probably making it into the plan and a lot more Upper Spraberry making it into the plan. We kind of have a couple really good tests and part of our culture is when something works, we implement it very, very quickly. And that's how we kind of see the shallower development picking up the pace in the Northern Midland Basin, particularly that Northwest Martin County area that we feel really good about for adding a new zone.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Okay, great. And then maybe just a housekeeping type question on the non-core asset sales side, particularly on the upstream. I think a few people noted now just how you're exceeding or you've already exceeded the target, before year end here, and it makes sense that there's no need to go out, and do more right away. But just wondering if you could speak to potential opportunities, maybe in terms of longer dated inventory that someone else might find more valuable than theirs, how do you think about opportunities that can near?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. A good question. That ties to something that Danny answered your last question. The number of wells in the Midland Basin will be kind of 85%, 90% of total capital. So, the Delaware Basin still be a small percentage of total capital. I think if I'm getting what your question is, it's what, where does the Delaware Basin sit in the portfolio. I think, for us certainly we start that area of capital a little bit here in the last few years. I think it provides a lot of cash flow and a lot of production which is beneficial to us today. But, as you've seen over the course of the year, it certainly seems like, inventory is coming in a premium. And, there may come a time where someone really, really wants to Delaware position of ours or portions of it but we're not going to sell it for [ASONG] (ph) and PD15, right, PDP. So, I think we're going to hold it for now. And if someone wants to pay for upside in a reasonable, number versus where we trade, we'll take a look at it.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Perfect. Thank you.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nitin Kumar of Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nNitin Kumar: Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Travis, I want to start on slide 11. That you've been espousing the co-development approach for some time and you show pretty solid results, and consistent results since 2020. Just curious, one of your, I guess, peers in the Basin talked about increasing recoveries by 20%, through the use of technology. You guys are at the cutting edge yourself, so I'm curious are you seeing anything out there that can improve recovery factors by that kind of magnitude?\nTravis D. Stice: Nitin, we keep our figure on the pulse of a lot of emerging technologies. We focus our internal expertise on improving recovery. That's not something that's on our radar screen that we're aware of today, but that's not to say that the potential is not there as you look forward in the future. There's a lot of smart guys in our industry. We have a ton of smart guys inside Diamondback, and whether that technology is developed internally or externally, it's widely communicated and quickly followed as particular that kind of result. So, we're focused on improving recovery and I know our peers are doing the same. That's not a today number for sure, though.\nNitin Kumar: I guess my follow-up would be if you are a fast follower you've talked about how volume is an output of your program, your capital allocation framework, in an event that you could improve recoveries that way, would you allow, would you keep activity flat, or do you expect to reduce CapEx and just maintain that volume growth to be in the low-single-digits?\nDaniel N. Wesson: Yes. I mean, I think generally that would be a great problem to have. It really ties to this can you run a SimulFRAC program consistently on that position and those projects and those paths kind of goes all those back to this longer cycle nature of the shale business model. And, I think, we feel really good about four SimulFRAC crews running consistently right now, Nitin, and have the infrastructure to do that. And, if growth exceeded expectations there'll be a good problem to have.\nNitin Kumar: Great. Thanks. That's it for me guys.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade: Good morning. Travis, Kaes and Danny. I want to ask one more question, but maybe from a different angle on the on the A&D outlook. Kaes, I think it was, I think I wrote down what you said that, in your prepared comments or maybe earlier Q&A, that there's very few positions out there that you envy. And so, that makes sense that you guys, your bar is high. But from my seat, it also looks like if you look at the other side of the equation, it looks like, there not a lot of positions you want to buy, but there's also fewer possible, fewer potential buyers out there, particularly for some of these large, large private positions. So, how does the -- I guess do you agree that there's fewer credible buyers some of these big packages that may still be out there. And more broadly, how's the kind of the lineup shifting is your active in data rooms and in processes buyers versus sellers?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. That's an interesting observation Charles, and it's certainly not lost on us. You've had a couple very large buyers do a couple of deals in the basin and out of the basin. They could kind of do whatever they want, it seems like, but, I would just say generally industry consolidation has happened is continuing to happen. I think a lot of the privates are gone, as you mentioned, to logical acquirers. I would just say that there may be less buyers of assets, but they're all very well-funded good operators, big balance sheets, and competitive. So, I think we just have to stick to our zones and our underwriting philosophy, which is our cost structure, our rates return internally, lot of hurdles for commodity price and usually that has resulted in more assets coming to Diamondback because you can underwrite wells drills at $1 million or $2 million cheaper. We can run LOE above cheaper, that's the kind of stuff that accretes to our shareholders.\nCharles Meade: Got it. Thanks for that. That's it for me.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Charles.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to keep on the A&D theme. When we are assessing the potential of a large private or one of these unicorns to potentially consolidate, does it just come back to price, or is there something do you think that they think about in terms of the independent versus major oil business model that could be advantageous to a company with, like, Diamondback who's in Midland and again the lowest cost structures in the industry?\nTravis D. Stice: Yeah. Arun, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about what sellers think. We just think about what is the best opportunity available for our shareholders and creating shareholder value for our shareholders. And you know at the end of the day, I think Diamondback hand on heart as one of the best positions remaining in North America and the best cost structure. And that should be a, a very winning combination for our shareholders for a long time here.\nArun Jayaram: Understood. I want to maybe switch gears and just talk about the DUC efficiency gains, really surprised to see this year the drilling efficiency gains seems like the drilling efficiency gains are outpacing maybe what we're seeing on the completion side. Are you guys recalibrating the call it the rig to frac crew ratio, but give us a sense of, maybe what you're doing on the drilling side for these efficiency gains and maybe help us recalibrate what that drilling the SimulFRAC crew ratio looks like today?\nTravis D. Stice: Yeah. It's interesting. We really haven't thought about the rig to crew ratio in a long time because just changed so much. I think we've moved to a world where we know how many wells we need to drill and how many wells we need to complete in a year to hit numbers. And the drilling side, maybe a year ago that was 15 to 16 rigs for a full year. And now this year, in upcoming, it looks more like 14 to 15. So, the amount of work that our planning team does on the plan and how we're doing relative to plan is pretty astounding and how far ahead they are on these paths. And when we need to pick up a rig and when we need to drop it, you're really kind of just targeting, can we keep those silent track crews busy consistently? And I would guess, I guess the number is kind of in that high threes, almost four rigs to one SimulFRAC through today.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. Arun its Kaes. Our goal is to keep the drilling program ahead of the SimulFRAC fleet and just keep the SimulFRAC fleet moving in efficient just like we want to keep rigs moving from pad to pad without waiting on pack instruction or whatever. So we kind of see them as two different programs altogether, knowing that they're very dependent on each other. But I think the, the drilling and completion teams both this year have really done an excellent job of leaning in and pushing the machine to the limits and finding the little pieces of efficiency gains that can pick up. And we continue as we've always done to tinker and find better ways to execute our development strategy and build a better mousetrap. And when we find different ways to design these wells and execute that. We'll lean into it and continue to chase that the efficiency line.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning and congrats on another good quarter. I want to follow-up on Arun\u2019s question, just on the activity set in the next year. And get some more clarity on the plan for the DUCs. And so it sounds like you could be running, the 14 or 15 rigs. Will you end up drilling, 330 or so wells by running 14 or 15 rigs, or will the base plan for next year contemplate a drawdown of some of those excess DUCs?\nKaes Van't Hof: I don't think we're planning on drawing any down, absent any in the field issues. I think generally, we feel a lot better at this level of DUCs for the size of projects that we have ahead of us. Earlier this year, we were getting pretty close, that the rigs or the frackers were getting pretty close to the rigs getting off location and 20 well pad or 24 well pad or however you want to break it up, you have to have all 24 wells done before you can bring on the drilling side, before you can bring the fracture in. At least that's how we do it. And that's why that kind of 150 number, we mentioned feels like a much more balanced number going forward.\nScott Gruber: I got you. So the inventory count is under normal conditions is just going up. I got it.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. This feels like a good inventory number. Again going back, we're not these aren't the days of two well pads where something bad happens, you can pull out the pad and go somewhere else. These are long cycle mini, Daniel like to call mini offshore projects given the amount of dollars that go into a project before [first oil] (ph) comes online.\nScott Gruber: That makes sense. And in good detail on, all the cost trends across the various, buckets on slide 10. If you think about, going through RFP season for various services, I know you have some longer term contracts in place, but do you think you'll see any continued deflation across any of the major buckets as you go into 2024? Are those starting to stabilize now?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. I think we think, it's kind of stabilizing right now. And then for us, there really is no RFP season, right? RFP seasons every day coming back. If something's cheaper and we can do something cheaper or replace something with something cheaper, it's going to happen right away. It's not going to wait for next season or for the summer. It's going to happen now. So it's a constant RFP season here. And these are all real time costs that the team has to present to Travis on a line by line basis every quarter. And this is a real time look at where we are and where things are headed. As you noticed, we put a Q4 2023 number in there. Just to kind of show where, even we've moved from Q3 to Q4.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani : Hey, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on 2024. If I'm kind of reading this right, it looks like you guys are talking about a rough budget next year of just a hair over $2.5 billion. Sounds like that's kind of flat activity. Just wanted to get a sense of kind of what's assumed in there for inflation or deflation? Are you just kind of assuming sort of current well costs in that number?\nTravis D. Stice: Yeah. I mean, we're always kind of a little conservative here, Leo. So, I would say we're kind of in the range of where we think we are today. Again, we think generally service costs have kind of modelled or flattened out. And, I've seen a major change in rig count. This feels like a pretty good range for next year.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. And then just to follow-up quickly on the M&A topic here. Think you guys have made it pretty clear that you want to continue to be a consolidator over time with your cost advantage. I guess at the same time, just kind of, you guys talk about kind of a $60 type of budgeting case, for oil, obviously, been above there. Is there any scenario where FANG thinks about potentially going the other way, and actually selling at the end of the day?\nTravis D. Stice: You know, Leo, I tried to address that a little bit in my opening comments as one of the first questions and also in my letter. Look, we'll always do the right thing for our shareholders we've been -- I feel like we've done that for 12 years now. But again, what our focus is on delivering our business plan, and we believe in our business model, we believe that there's a meaningful spot in our investment community for a company like Diamondback, and we continue to execute flawlessly. And I think I'm really confident about what our forward plan looks like.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. Thanks.\nTravis D. Stice: Thanks, Leo.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. One, one of the way that to reduce costs, I think the industry is moving for the electrification. And shot at that, wondering if you can give us some idea that how far along on your process in doing so? And secondly, that with the Deep Blue, I think in the past that, you guys are very proud of your water infrastructure and all that. So is that signaling that now you have a change of view of, what kind of infrastructure need to be on by or need to be controlled by Diamondback going forward. So should we just assume that this means that you really don't think that's necessary for you to have control or to own those infrastructure. Thank you.\nTravis D. Stice: Yeah. Good questions, Paul. I'll take the second one first, on the midstream infrastructure. We spent a lot of money building those systems to the specs that we needed. And so, I think we're not turning over a blank canvas. Right? This is a painting that's already been, it's finished finishing touches. And so we feel confident, particularly with a lot of our field team members going over to Deep Blue to run the asset, that will be well, well served as its largest customer and also a large equity holder. So think if we were early in our development plan, might be a different story. But in this case, it's a very well built out system that is kind of readymade to turn over to them to, in our minds, do some more things commercially that we couldn't do as a standalone, water enterprise. And then your other question on electrification, know, certainly a hot topic in the Permian I think, generally electrification means both lower cost and lower environmental footprint. And that's a great thing for us in the basin. And we've done a lot of work ourselves I think the state of Texas and the utilities need to kind of do their part to get, more power out to the Permian to connect to all of us so that we can run off of line power versus different forms of generation in the field. So I think that's going to be a constant battle that we're intently focused on. And, again, it saves us money and improves environmental performance that that feels like a win.\nPaul Cheng: Just curious that, I mean, what percent of your operation now here has already been electric buy in, that way you think is the biggest opportunity over the next one or two years.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yeah. We've got about 90% to 95% of our current production operations, electrified, we've been the biggest opportunities we've been working on to-date, in the production operations world or been electrification of our compression fleet. And I think we're probably 70-ish percent electrified there. So we'll continue to work on getting rid of our gas, gas receipt compressors and putting electric packages, in their place. And then on the DMC side, we've got two SimulFRAC fleets that are, Haliburton, what they call their zoos fleets, are there electric fleets and we've really enjoyed the benefits of those and look forward to continuing to try and electrify the completion world. And then on the drilling side we've got, I think, five or six rigs running right now on line power, and we're continuing to put in the infrastructure that we need to run those rigs off line power, as the supply chain kind of frees up, on the back of COVID and we can get the electrical equipment we need to convert those rigs. So, it's kind of all over. But we're working on it as fast as we can and I anticipate that over the next four or five years, there won't be much of the field that's not electrified.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks.\nTravis D. Stice: I appreciate all the good questions this morning. I hope you find our shareholder letter constructive in in the way that we can help communicate details about our business plan. The last comment I want to make before we sign off is that we have an opportunity this Saturday to recognize all of our veterans across this country on Veterans Day, certainly for all of the veterans that are important by Diamondback, thank you for your service. And then anyone that's on the phone that also dedicated a portion of their lives to our country. I want to tell you, thank you for your service as well. And then, particularly for the Diamondback employees, hopefully, we'll see you at breakfast or lunch ceremonies that we have planned for this Friday. So thank you. You all have a great day and God bless.\nOperator: Alright. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Daniel N. Wesson",
            "content": "Yes. I'll hit the organic growth comment first. Certainly we excluding the Viper deal, we expect it to grow organically. And we expect to grow organically in 2024. I think, the Viper deal provides a little bit of a jump start here in Q4, but think the team's expecting to grow off that number to steady state throughout the next year, just due to the quality of what we've got in front of us. And, on the DUC side we were kind of operating pretty close to the rigs on the completion crews and really needed some flexibility here and that the drilling team's done a really good job this year getting ahead of plan, drilling more wells than expected sooner. With these large pads and large projects you really want to have the flexibility to be able to go somewhere if something bad happens and, that DUC backlog allows that. So I think, 150 plus or minus 10 or 20 wells either way is a pretty good number for our run rate. And, we've kind of set the stage for a world where we run for the SimulFRAC crews consistently throughout the year, they each do about 80 wells a year. And, in our mind that's kind of the most capital efficient development plan we can imagine here. So, that's our backlog, just let Danny sleep a little better at night. And, allows for some flexibility heading into next year. Yes. I mean, I don't think it's necessary, Scott. I think we've positioned the business through both large scale and small scale M&A. It's just kind of been in our DNA for the last 10 years. I'd kind of go back to thinking about what positions in North American shale or in the Midland Basin would be envy, and there are very few particularly with where we sit today and the amount of deals we've done over the years. So, I think it's a fortunate spot to be in with the inventory duration and depth that we have relative to what's out there. I just think Travis's comment is really about knowing who you are. And this Company has been a, acquirer and exploit company that's been able to execute on acquiring and exploiting assets through our low cost structure. And, generally we have had a philosophy that the low cost operator in a commodity based business wins. And, our cost structure is what has created this business to be as big as it is today. Travis, do you want anything to that? Yes. That's a good question, Roger. No, I think it's interesting, we put it to slide in, slide 10 about operational track record in prowess and, I think we sat in this room two or three years ago saying, hey, the drilling guys, they're near the asymptotic curve of drilling these wells. Well, you look at the top left of that chart, they're still taking days out of the average well on a much bigger program, right. These guys are drilling 280 wells in the Midland Basin, two, three, four days faster than they were even two years ago. And, the culture that we built accretes that value to our shareholders. It's not something we model, but it certainly comes our way. So in the field, I think that's part of what is coming our way. I also think, generally we've tested some other zones in the Midland Basin that looked very, very good. We got a couple Upper Spraberry tests in the Northern Midland Basin that looked very good relative to our Middle Sprague Road, Jo Mill development. So, we're excited about that. I think the Wolfcamp D in the Midland Basin is starting to become a primary development zone in some of the basin. And, certainly, there's a lot of excitement about deeper zones in the Midland Basin as well the Barnett and the Woodford that we're on the testing. So I think, the Midland Basin, the [stacked bay] (ph) and the amount of oil in place, just provides a lot of opportunity for future value to accrete to our shareholders that they don't know about today. Travis, do you want anything to add? Yes. I think, we're kind of looking at it, like, our maintenance our case for 2024 is kind of a maintenance activity case. So, flat activity outfits a little bit of a growth, but, if we were to try and maintain a flat production profile, you'd probably be in the line of 20 to 30 less wells in the year. Yes. Good question, Derrick. We do lay out some of our remaining JVs that we have on slide 26. Yes, I think some of those logically are monetized at some point in the coming years. I don't think we're in a huge rush to do so, but, in most cases, we're kind of a non-op partner to these JVs that do have a ton of value just not something that we can commit to monetizing today. Yes. Jeff, with these longer cycle projects we have a pretty good view of what the projects look like coming up here in 2024. I'd say generally we're going to be in the range of 11,000 feet average lateral length, probably maybe even a little bit more than that. I would say it's also a very heavy, Martin County development year for us, which is great, large scale, multi-zone development, and some of the best undeveloped resource remaining in the Midland Basin. I'd say, from a testing perspective some more wells can be probably making it into the plan and a lot more Upper Spraberry making it into the plan. We kind of have a couple really good tests and part of our culture is when something works, we implement it very, very quickly. And that's how we kind of see the shallower development picking up the pace in the Northern Midland Basin, particularly that Northwest Martin County area that we feel really good about for adding a new zone. Yes. I mean, I think generally that would be a great problem to have. It really ties to this can you run a SimulFRAC program consistently on that position and those projects and those paths kind of goes all those back to this longer cycle nature of the shale business model. And, I think, we feel really good about four SimulFRAC crews running consistently right now, Nitin, and have the infrastructure to do that. And, if growth exceeded expectations there'll be a good problem to have."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes. I mean, I think the biggest benefit to the large scale development, Neal, is the consistency of running the rigs in the same spot for a long period of time. But, on the frac side is where we save the most money from a capital perspective, because we're doing -- in some cases, two SimulFRAC crews on the same site at the same time. So, you're saving essentially, $250,000 - $300,000 a well from SimulFRAC. And now we have two of those fleets or e-fleets that run-off lean gas that save kind of another $200,000 - $250,000 of well. So, now this large scale development kind of ties to the longer cycle nature of our business, and that also means we don't want to change the plan every move in oil price. And so, we've had a consistent plan here for a few years now, and the output of that is consistent results on the well productivity per foot. Yes. I mean, I think I kind of said this that we put our next five years up with anybody in North America, and I still stand by that. I think we have another solid, five or ten years beyond that. It's very logical that at some point you're going to have to move down the quality of your inventory. We don't see that in the forward plan today, but if we retain our cost structure and our ability to drill wells $1 million or $1.5 million or $2 million cheaper. Well, as the shale cost curve goes up, we continue to stay at the low end of that cost curve. It's kind of been our mantra for 10 years now. And we started with 50,000 acres an hour at [55000] (ph). And, as that culture and mantra has not changed. And I think that sets us up well for a world, where assets are getting more and more sparse. Yes, it's really all about value, like we talked about last night, if you run your business conservatively from an oil price perspective and accrete value quarterly at $75 to $80, $85 crude, if you're actually building equity value on a conservative basis, right. I kind of said last night to you that, I think generally if you run a quarter like last quarter versus the $60 base case, you're basically building $3, $4 a share of extra intrinsic value. And I think that's what we've done here over the last couple of years in this up-cycle. And, as Travis mentioned, we want to be conservative when buying back stock. We think capital is precious and capital discipline not just applies in the field, but it applies, to returning capital to shareholders. And that's why we've had this flexible return of capital program since we put it in place two and a half years ago. Thanks, Derrick. That's a good question, Derrick. And I'd probably say that maintenance CapEx would be $100 million to $200 million cheaper, 30 wells maybe, Danny. Thanks, Derrick. Yes. I mean, that's a good question, Kevin. I hate to say it, but we didn't win those deals because we were buddies and been left and other people. So, I think we bid the most, but we bid the most because we could underwrite it with the lowest cost, right. At the time, I think some Lario well costs were near $8.5 million, $9.5 million for 10,000 foot lateral, and we were drilling them at [$6.5 million to $7 million] (ph). And so that's kind of been our mantra for a long time. I would just say generally if you split the two deals out, Lario was an execution deal because we knew we could drill those units cheaper, and execute on large scale development. I would say, FireBird is more of a technical deal. And, we had a technical view of that particular area that the basin could move further west, particularly in the northern top portion there'd be some multi-zone development that looks really good. I think we're conservative on the multi-zone potential of the central block. And now feel a little more confident about the Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry and maybe being wind wrapped in that area. And also, with the benefit of that block being so contiguous, we're able to bring a 15,000 foot lateral manufacturing process to that area. So, now we underwrite these deals at our cost structure, which if you look at our cost structure versus others that means we should get more of those properties at the same rate of return because of our ability to execute. Yes. A good question. That ties to something that Danny answered your last question. The number of wells in the Midland Basin will be kind of 85%, 90% of total capital. So, the Delaware Basin still be a small percentage of total capital. I think if I'm getting what your question is, it's what, where does the Delaware Basin sit in the portfolio. I think, for us certainly we start that area of capital a little bit here in the last few years. I think it provides a lot of cash flow and a lot of production which is beneficial to us today. But, as you've seen over the course of the year, it certainly seems like, inventory is coming in a premium. And, there may come a time where someone really, really wants to Delaware position of ours or portions of it but we're not going to sell it for [ASONG] (ph) and PD15, right, PDP. So, I think we're going to hold it for now. And if someone wants to pay for upside in a reasonable, number versus where we trade, we'll take a look at it. Yes. That's an interesting observation Charles, and it's certainly not lost on us. You've had a couple very large buyers do a couple of deals in the basin and out of the basin. They could kind of do whatever they want, it seems like, but, I would just say generally industry consolidation has happened is continuing to happen. I think a lot of the privates are gone, as you mentioned, to logical acquirers. I would just say that there may be less buyers of assets, but they're all very well-funded good operators, big balance sheets, and competitive. So, I think we just have to stick to our zones and our underwriting philosophy, which is our cost structure, our rates return internally, lot of hurdles for commodity price and usually that has resulted in more assets coming to Diamondback because you can underwrite wells drills at $1 million or $2 million cheaper. We can run LOE above cheaper, that's the kind of stuff that accretes to our shareholders. Thanks, Charles. Yeah. Arun its Kaes. Our goal is to keep the drilling program ahead of the SimulFRAC fleet and just keep the SimulFRAC fleet moving in efficient just like we want to keep rigs moving from pad to pad without waiting on pack instruction or whatever. So we kind of see them as two different programs altogether, knowing that they're very dependent on each other. But I think the, the drilling and completion teams both this year have really done an excellent job of leaning in and pushing the machine to the limits and finding the little pieces of efficiency gains that can pick up. And we continue as we've always done to tinker and find better ways to execute our development strategy and build a better mousetrap. And when we find different ways to design these wells and execute that. We'll lean into it and continue to chase that the efficiency line. I don't think we're planning on drawing any down, absent any in the field issues. I think generally, we feel a lot better at this level of DUCs for the size of projects that we have ahead of us. Earlier this year, we were getting pretty close, that the rigs or the frackers were getting pretty close to the rigs getting off location and 20 well pad or 24 well pad or however you want to break it up, you have to have all 24 wells done before you can bring on the drilling side, before you can bring the fracture in. At least that's how we do it. And that's why that kind of 150 number, we mentioned feels like a much more balanced number going forward. Yeah. This feels like a good inventory number. Again going back, we're not these aren't the days of two well pads where something bad happens, you can pull out the pad and go somewhere else. These are long cycle mini, Daniel like to call mini offshore projects given the amount of dollars that go into a project before [first oil] (ph) comes online. Yeah. I think we think, it's kind of stabilizing right now. And then for us, there really is no RFP season, right? RFP seasons every day coming back. If something's cheaper and we can do something cheaper or replace something with something cheaper, it's going to happen right away. It's not going to wait for next season or for the summer. It's going to happen now. So it's a constant RFP season here. And these are all real time costs that the team has to present to Travis on a line by line basis every quarter. And this is a real time look at where we are and where things are headed. As you noticed, we put a Q4 2023 number in there. Just to kind of show where, even we've moved from Q3 to Q4. Thanks, Scott. Yeah. We've got about 90% to 95% of our current production operations, electrified, we've been the biggest opportunities we've been working on to-date, in the production operations world or been electrification of our compression fleet. And I think we're probably 70-ish percent electrified there. So we'll continue to work on getting rid of our gas, gas receipt compressors and putting electric packages, in their place. And then on the DMC side, we've got two SimulFRAC fleets that are, Haliburton, what they call their zoos fleets, are there electric fleets and we've really enjoyed the benefits of those and look forward to continuing to try and electrify the completion world. And then on the drilling side we've got, I think, five or six rigs running right now on line power, and we're continuing to put in the infrastructure that we need to run those rigs off line power, as the supply chain kind of frees up, on the back of COVID and we can get the electrical equipment we need to convert those rigs. So, it's kind of all over. But we're working on it as fast as we can and I anticipate that over the next four or five years, there won't be much of the field that's not electrified."

            "name": "Travis D. Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and good morning to everyone. As Adam mentioned, we released a Shareholder Letter last night that contains much of the narrative we hope to cover again this morning. So with that, we'll just open the lines up for question. Operator? Yes. Neal, that's a good question. Look, the world is certainly in a mess right now across any number of fronts. All of which could potentially move the markets both positively and negatively, both with the supply disruption or even a demand destruction as well too. So, obviously, we can't control any of those items. Again, we simply respond to our shareholders that own our company. That right now return a shareholder model versus a growth model, as we've intimated our plans as we look forward into next year again, look for real efficient capital allocation and as an output of that capital allocation which expect low-single-digit type volume growth. Again, not as an input, but what results from an efficient capital allocation program. Sure. On the development strategy, over time slide, which is slide 11 for those of you that are looking at it online. We tried to demonstrate our evolution from 2015 to today, and we said average wells per project is about 24 wells. I think generally that applies across our Midland Basin. However, not all deposits are equal in terms of the way the shale were laid down across the Midland Basin. So, there will be areas where we can do slightly more than 24 wells, and then areas also where we'll do slightly less than 24 wells, which usually translates to one or two wells less per shale interval. So again, it's a general representation showing the development over time. But that's a good that's a good summary. And then, let's see. What was your second question? Yes, certainly. Again, referencing back to slide 10, we've laid out the biggest elements of cost savings, cost components, and the reductions over time. And again, as you pointed out, it's casing to down 20% or so. It's really, as you look into next year, we feel more of a kind of a steady state run rate on our cost. There'll be some puts and takes on both sides of the equation. Kaes, do you want to add anything? Thanks, Neal. So, Neil, our main focus remains a sustainable in growing base dividend that we think represents the most efficient way for our shareholders to understand what our shareholder return program looks like. Following that is the share repurchase program, which we laid out the -- what we've done in the third quarter in so far in the fourth quarter. And then we honor our commitment to return at least 75% of our free cash flow by making our shareholders hold in the form of variable, which we've seen we did this year. I think the most important thing is when you talk about share repurchases is that you need to have some discipline around that because in my experience, lack of discipline leads to chasing stock repurchases all the way to the top of the cycle. So, we like most of our capital allocation decisions, actually like all of our capital allocation decisions, we hold ourselves accountable to some form of rigorous analytics, and in this case, we continue to run a NAV value at mid cycle oil prices, which is $60 oil, and calculate oil price or calculate stock price, and depending on where our stock is trading relative to that calculation, we either buy more of in the further dislocation we get from that, we buy, we increase or if not then we pivot to a share repurchase -- or to a variable dividend like we did this time around. So, again, it just it's based dividend. Its share repurchases with a degree of caution in a pro-cyclical environment and then honoring our commitment to the form of a variable dividend. Yes. Good question, Neil. The Deep Blue JV was a very big deal for us. It took a long time to pull together. We had built a significant amount of midstream infrastructure over the years and spent a lot of capital doing it. And, we felt it was an opportune time to monetize that in the hands of who we see as operational experts in Deep Blue and the Five Point team. I think they have already proven to have commercial success with third-parties where maybe if you'll the Diamondback business card, you weren't going have the same type of commercial success. I think that sector is certainly ripe for consolidation as well. And I think they're the experts that can get that done. So, that's kind of why we retained the 30% equity interest in the business. We're very confident that they're going to be able to grow the business and generate a good return for our shareholders. Outside of the $500 million of proceeds we got in which is the big winner. There will be some impacts to our cost structure. I would say generally, LOE is going to be up about 8% to 10% versus prior as a company. And then we'll have a lot less midstream CapEx as we don't have very many operated midstream assets. And that'll be kind of canceled out by slightly higher well costs $10 to $20 a foot, depending on the area, as we buy water from the JV. So, all-in-all, we sold the business for a much higher multiple than we trade. And then we're excited to see what they can do in terms of creating value for the 30% that we're retaining. Thanks, Neil. Yes, David. And I appreciate you referencing the Shareholder Letter. I tried to address that head-on. I think just in a more macro sense, we'll always do what's right for our shareholders. I mean, we've got now over a decade of what I think is demonstrating doing the right thing for our shareholders. But, we remain laser focused on delivering on our business plan, and you're right, we have built this Company through an acquirer and exposure strategy. But I think as investors are really starting to understand, we have such a high quality inventory right now, that the bar is pretty high for additional opportunities to add to our inventory that meets those the criteria that we laid out in our Shareholder Letter would sound industrial logics and being able or -- logic and being able to compete for capital right away and then being accretive on those financial measures that are so important to all of this. So, there has been a lot of private equity roll through. And I think, based on lack of our name on those, it just tells you where we view those assets relative to our inventory. Like I said, I'm really pleased with the quality of our inventory. And I think, we're executing on that in a flawless manner. Thanks, David. I think that makes sense. We've talked about the high bar for entry into the Diamondback portfolio. And, there's just, that's just how we view it. And, we're very proud of the inventory we have. And I think what goes along with that durable inventory is how we convert that inventory into cash flow. And again, you see this quarter flawless execution from our teams in converting rock into cash flow. And that's, our cost structure is enviable. Our execution prowess is unmatched. And that makes that makes a big difference when you talk about a profitable oil and gas company like that. Thanks, Scott. Yes. Roger, if you back cast 10 years ago, when we first started this, we're still drilling a few vertical wells. And, I put in the letter that we released last night, just a couple of data points on a 7500 foot lateral well, which has a total depth, total major depth of about what we were drilling vertically when we started. But drilling, we drill those 7500 foot lateral wells in under four days. And when we started, we were drilling it, sometimes it'd take us over 24, 25 days to get down to that same measured depth vertically. And so, probably the most repeated question that we get, is what is the secret sauce, what is the magic that Diamondback does that allows execution quarter-over-quarter to just far exceed the competition. It's essentially, the same rock and the same tools, but the culture that we built here at this Company with that laser focus on the conversion process of rock into cash flow, is felt by every employee in the Company. And when you have everyone leaning in the same direction on cost and efficiency, as long as we can continue to give them good rock, they're going to generate the outstanding results that we're known for. So, I know that's a little bit of motherhood and apple pie, but it's -- I'm really proud of the organization for -- through all the cycles we've been through over the last 10 years, what hasn't changed is an unrelenting focus on delivering, best-in-class execution, highest margin barrels at the lowest cost. Thanks, Roger. Thanks, Derrick. You know, Derrick, while you're on that topic of maintenance CapEx, I might just point you to slide seven, we've had that slide in there a couple of times, but it shows maintenance CapEx, which Danny just defined, is kind of holding, the fourth quarter production flat for next year. And I just want to show you what our breakeven prices are on that slide, $32 a barrel to cover maintenance cap, maintenance CapEx, $40 barrel to cover our base dividend. So, that kind of goes back to my cost and execution comments that ultimately translate into a very protected business model even at low commodity prices. Thanks, Derrick. Good question, Kevin. Morning, Jeff. Thanks, Jeff. Nitin, we keep our figure on the pulse of a lot of emerging technologies. We focus our internal expertise on improving recovery. That's not something that's on our radar screen that we're aware of today, but that's not to say that the potential is not there as you look forward in the future. There's a lot of smart guys in our industry. We have a ton of smart guys inside Diamondback, and whether that technology is developed internally or externally, it's widely communicated and quickly followed as particular that kind of result. So, we're focused on improving recovery and I know our peers are doing the same. That's not a today number for sure, though. Thanks Charles. Yeah. Arun, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about what sellers think. We just think about what is the best opportunity available for our shareholders and creating shareholder value for our shareholders. And you know at the end of the day, I think Diamondback hand on heart as one of the best positions remaining in North America and the best cost structure. And that should be a, a very winning combination for our shareholders for a long time here. Yeah. It's interesting. We really haven't thought about the rig to crew ratio in a long time because just changed so much. I think we've moved to a world where we know how many wells we need to drill and how many wells we need to complete in a year to hit numbers. And the drilling side, maybe a year ago that was 15 to 16 rigs for a full year. And now this year, in upcoming, it looks more like 14 to 15. So, the amount of work that our planning team does on the plan and how we're doing relative to plan is pretty astounding and how far ahead they are on these paths. And when we need to pick up a rig and when we need to drop it, you're really kind of just targeting, can we keep those silent track crews busy consistently? And I would guess, I guess the number is kind of in that high threes, almost four rigs to one SimulFRAC through today. Yeah. I mean, we're always kind of a little conservative here, Leo. So, I would say we're kind of in the range of where we think we are today. Again, we think generally service costs have kind of modelled or flattened out. And, I've seen a major change in rig count. This feels like a pretty good range for next year. You know, Leo, I tried to address that a little bit in my opening comments as one of the first questions and also in my letter. Look, we'll always do the right thing for our shareholders we've been -- I feel like we've done that for 12 years now. But again, what our focus is on delivering our business plan, and we believe in our business model, we believe that there's a meaningful spot in our investment community for a company like Diamondback, and we continue to execute flawlessly. And I think I'm really confident about what our forward plan looks like. Thanks, Leo. Yeah. Good questions, Paul. I'll take the second one first, on the midstream infrastructure. We spent a lot of money building those systems to the specs that we needed. And so, I think we're not turning over a blank canvas. Right? This is a painting that's already been, it's finished finishing touches. And so we feel confident, particularly with a lot of our field team members going over to Deep Blue to run the asset, that will be well, well served as its largest customer and also a large equity holder. So think if we were early in our development plan, might be a different story. But in this case, it's a very well built out system that is kind of readymade to turn over to them to, in our minds, do some more things commercially that we couldn't do as a standalone, water enterprise. And then your other question on electrification, know, certainly a hot topic in the Permian I think, generally electrification means both lower cost and lower environmental footprint. And that's a great thing for us in the basin. And we've done a lot of work ourselves I think the state of Texas and the utilities need to kind of do their part to get, more power out to the Permian to connect to all of us so that we can run off of line power versus different forms of generation in the field. So I think that's going to be a constant battle that we're intently focused on. And, again, it saves us money and improves environmental performance that that feels like a win. I appreciate all the good questions this morning. I hope you find our shareholder letter constructive in in the way that we can help communicate details about our business plan. The last comment I want to make before we sign off is that we have an opportunity this Saturday to recognize all of our veterans across this country on Veterans Day, certainly for all of the veterans that are important by Diamondback, thank you for your service. And then anyone that's on the phone that also dedicated a portion of their lives to our country. I want to tell you, thank you for your service as well. And then, particularly for the Diamondback employees, hopefully, we'll see you at breakfast or lunch ceremonies that we have planned for this Friday. So thank you. You all have a great day and God bless."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Diamondback Energy Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the VP of Investor Relations, Adam Lawlis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis : Thank you, Jules. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice : Good morning, and thank you, Adam. As Adam mentioned, last night we released a shareholder letter in conjunction with our press release, and this is our second quarter in a row we've tried this. I hope you find it useful. We believe that it not only increases the transparency directly to our shareholders but also improves efficiency, and those of you who have followed our story for a long time know how important improving efficiency is to us. So with that, operator, let's move right into questions, if you'll open the line.\nOperator: At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann : Morning, Travis. Guys. Nice quarter. Travis, my first question, maybe get right to it, is on service cost, and we've heard a lot of chatter about. Specifically, could you speak to maybe the current rig and frac rate environment today versus a couple of months ago? And maybe more importantly, what are you all assuming the change in cost for the remainder of the year, and how this could impact the '24 levels?\nTravis Stice : Neal, Good morning That's a good question. When you look at our business partners on the service side, they have always been responsive to declining and increasing rig count, and the Permian Basin rig count continues to decline. And with the discipline we're seeing across the E&P space with the reluctance to increase spending, we believe that we will continue to see a softening in cost on our -- from our friends on the service side. Now with that, that's only part of the calculus. The other part, which we view more as the variable side, we continue to drive cost out of the equation with increased efficiency. And like we talked about in May, we also see continued input costs coming down on steel, cement and other items. So it's hard to forecast into the future, but we definitely believe that we're going to see a softening in many of the costs that we've seen from the first half of the year. And we also continue to rely on the organization to do things more efficiently, which they continue to do quarter-over-quarter.\nNeal Dingmann : So Travis, is it too early to call any deflation for next year at this point?\nDanny Wesson: I think it's premature to call it deflation from where we're headed at the end of the year, Neal. I think high level, we entered the year in the Midland Basin in like in the low 700s a foot, drilling complete and equipped costs, and we'll probably exit the year in the low 600s a foot. Again, we're not calling for a cratering of the service market, we're just calling for a rationalization of it where costs certainly went up into the right for all service lines and raw materials for 7 or 8 quarters, and now that's coming back down to earth a little bit. So we can kind of enter 2024 and rest of 2023 in the low 600s per foot in the Midland Basin. That feels like a pretty good baseline for 2024.\nNeal Dingmann : Great. Great point, guys. And then my second question on capital spend. Specifically, it looked like you slightly increased the midstream and upstream CapEx guidance very, very slightly. But I'm just wondering, are you able to give a little color on maybe how this will be allocated both for the upstream and midstream? And then potential benefits with this slight push in cost, especially noticeable around the midstream, but I'm curious around both, maybe any benefits that we could see from this upturn?\nDanny Wesson: Yes. I'll start with the upstream. We drilled a lot of wells in Q2, right. We've drilled a record amount of wells, 98 wells in the quarter. That would imply we're drilling almost 400 wells a year versus guidance at 340; so a lot of pipe in the ground, a lot of -- lot of footage drilled, almost a little over 1 million -- 1.1 million lateral feet. So it was a good quarter operations-wise, which is why we're slowing down the drilling pace in the second half of the year and building a few DUCs, so that's kind of part of the main bump on the DC&E side. And then on the midstream side, we have a lot of infrastructure in the Midland Basin that most of it is -- does have extra capacity. And if the neighbor needs water or needs to dispose the water and we have that capacity, we will spend a few dollars to connect to that person. So a few unique opportunities came up in Martin County throughout the last three or four months, and we're going to spend some dollars to get a lot of barrels, and that's high payback, high-return midstream spend.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta : Thank you so much, guys. The first question, Travis, is just on the M&A landscape in the Permian. And maybe you could talk about, do you see a role for Diamondback to continue to be a consolidator in the basin? And then also provide an update on the asset sales, as that program has gone very well for you guys?\nTravis Stice : I'll take those in reverse order. If you're talking about the deals that we did earlier in the year, they've been seamlessly integrated with absolutely no issue. I will say that both of those companies we acquired were running more rigs than we're currently running now, which again continues to be the trend as you see acquisitions occur, operators that are acquiring or dropping rigs as they focus on increased profitability. The landscape, Neil, certainly relative to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, there's just really a few opportunities out there, I mean there was a rush primarily on the private equity side to get deals into the market. And relative to what we see right now, it's very, very limited. As to Fang's roll in M&A, we have created a lot of shareholder value through M&A but our discipline has also been noteworthy as well, too. It's not important to win every deal. It's important to win deals that make us not bigger, but better, and so we'll continue to always hold ourselves accountable to that. But I'll go back to my earlier comment that relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year, it's pretty parsed on a go-forward basis.\nNeil Mehta : Thanks, Travis, and the follow-up is just optimal capital structure. We've talked about this in the calls over the years, but just how do you think about what the optimal cash level, leverage level is for the business? And it will help us sort of calibrate the return of capital profile for Q2? Thank you.\nTravis Stice : Sure. The leverage obviously moves around with the oil price, but I think having a leverage ratio of less than one is appropriate for the size and scale of a company of Diamondback size. I do think also with building a little bit of cash on the balance sheet continues to make sense in order to be opportunistic for share repurchases in a countercyclical way. But those are kind of the two inputs that we build our capital structure and return model around.\nOperator: [Operator instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram : Good morning, Travis and team. Both of my questions relate to CapEx. My first question is on your updated guide, you're guiding to an $80 million decline in sequential CapEx in 4Q versus 3Q, which you're pegging as the new baseline. I was wondering if you could help us understand the drivers of the lower CapEx in 4Q versus 3Q?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Arun. I would say 4Q versus 3Q is a combination of lower activity and lower costs going through the system. As you know, we're a cash CapEx payer, so we can see a few months in advance what CapEx is looking like and certainly coming down in the outlines. I would say generally, that's probably the low end of a baseline for the next year. I certainly think that a low 600s a quarter kind of runrate feels okay -- $600 million a quarter run rate feels okay for 2024. It is on the August 1, so we're going to put that in pencil and see where service costs shake out. But certainly, things tend to be moving our way from a well cost perspective. I gave some kind of cost per foot language earlier in the Midland Basin down to the low 600s by the end of the year. Still feels very achievable, and that kind of sets our targets for the upcoming year.\nArun Jayaram : Great. And kind of stole my thunder here on the second question, but your 2024 outlook is to drive low single digits oil growth. I know the Street is now modeling around $650 million per quarter in CapEx, but it sounds like you're comfortable, case as we stand here today, at something in the low 600s.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I'd say that today. Obviously, still a lot of things to shake out, but I think the quality of the inventory that we have coming up as well as the high mineral interest in the core of the basin, completely undeveloped sections and units feels like a very capital-efficient plan. We've kind of been highlighting this for the last couple of years. The guide on in QEP transactions provided a lot of undeveloped inventory that we can bring a large-scale execution machine to, and now we're seeing the benefits of those couple of deals.\nTravis Stice : Arun, just as a reminder, we've been guiding for kind of lower CapEx all year long in the back half, and we're seeing it play out now. And as we laid out on Slide 6 of our investor deck, sort of a forecast by quarter of what that looks like.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is now open. \nDerrick Whitfield : Good morning all and congrats on a strong quarter.\nTravis Stice : Thanks, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield : Staying on 2024, now that you've fully integrated FireBird and Lario, what is the right base level of activity that would support the 2024 outlook from a rig and frac spread perspective?\nDanny Wesson: Yes. I'll kind of highlight what we've done in 2023, and that feels like a good baseline for the floor plan, not forever, but how we think about capital allocation. We have a business where we can run four simul-frac crews efficiently, right? And simul-frac crew on the completion side completes about 80 wells a year. And for us, in this new business model of capital efficiency and profit value over volumes, we're focused on running the most efficient plan possible which would be that four simul-frac crew plan. Absent a major change in commodity price, that's -- the plan is the plan, and that allows the teams to plan their business and also allows us to execute at the lowest cost from a CapEx perspective. So kind of that 15-ish rigs and four simul-frac crews feels like a really good baseline for us.\nTravis Stice : And Derrick, just to add to that, this profitability model that we've been demonstrating now for multiple quarters in a row and the industry has pivoted to, I hope we have been able to demonstrate that volume growth is an output of efficient capital allocation that's laser-like focused on profitability. So as here on August 1, as we're entertaining questions on 2024, the volume growth will be an output of efficient capital allocation that maximizes the value for our capital allocation decisions.\nDerrick Whitfield : Understood. Thanks for that, Travis and as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on well productivity, which you've rightly highlighted on Page 15 as a positive. When you look out to 2024, how do you guys think about well productivity relative to 2023? And then how does that project over the next few years? It feels like you guys have a very deep portfolio that has quite a bit of stability over the next several years.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Derrick. I think generally, we feel very confident in the forward outlook for productivity. I think that's going to be a unique position in North American shale. We've been -- we timed deals very, very well, and we've made the shift to co-development four or five years ago now, and that's resulting in very steady productivity. As you can see within 1% of 2022 levels already in '23. And I would just say flat feels like the baseline, and if it's better than that, that's one for the good guys.\nTravis Stice : Derrick, we continue to lay out on Slide 16 in this deck what our inventory looks like. And as I look into the future, I couldn't be more confident about the long-term quality of our inventory. And in fact, that confidence in the future business plan is part of the reason that we're confident in being able to increase our base dividend. I mean that's, to me, the clearest indication from management to our owners about the future of our business and the quality of our inventory, is our ability to continually increase our base dividend. I think our quarterly CAGR for dividend increases is around 10% since we initiated it in 2018. So I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. \nCharles Meade : Good morning, Travis, Kaes and Adam and the rest of the FANG crew there. Travis, I wonder if you could drill down a little bit on the improved cycle times that's allowing you to increase your gross well count for the year? Is this something that's -- I can think about a few possibilities. Is this something that where you have a couple of rigs that have just increased their performance? Or is this something that's more widespread across your whole rig fleet, like perhaps a bit selection or something like that which is letting every rig just to get through the laterals quicker? What's the driver there?\nTravis Stice : Charles, I wish I could say it was one individual piece of technology that's transferable across our entire rig fleet, but it's much more subtle than that. And I'm going to let Danny give you some specific examples. But we get this question a lot, and it's always phrased in different ways about why does Diamondback do what they do, but the answer remains unchanged. It's the culture that we have that has an extreme focus on cost control and efficiencies. And the reason that that's important to our culture is because when we make those gains in efficiencies, those gains become permanent in part to our future capital allocation decisions, which makes us more competitive for the same dollar that's that we're competing with relative to our peers. And it's not -- again, it's not one or two items. It's thousands of items that are decided upon every one of these rigs. And look, we have a healthy competition among our rigs and completion crews that we incentivized monetarily for efficiency and cost control measures. And Dan, do you want to add some specifics on that?\nDanny Wesson: Yes. I think we've seen certainly our year-over-year days reduced by some measurable percentage. And what it boils down to is the team is measuring every little thing they can on the rig and measuring which way those operational metrics are trending. And when one is not trending in the right direction, they attack it with a fervor that is unlike anything I've ever seen, and that continues to output year-over-year improvements in execution. And this past month, we had a couple of wells that they've drilled at their all-time records for us for 7,500-foot laterals that were sub five-day wells for just over four days TD. And those results are remarkable, and we don't talk about individual well results a lot, but those are the things that we continue to do in the day-to-day of the company that can continue to drive our execution downward.\nTravis Stice : Charles, just one add to that. We just completed our quarterly reviews several weeks ago, and the teams present to us levels of details of measurement that Daniel was talking about, which is almost stunning to me, but we do it almost every quarter. And that is, they measure how long it takes to physically screw pipe together for 300 times for every trip they have to make. And in that measurement of just simply screwing pipe together in five minutes versus the next rig over that was 6 minutes, you think doesn't matter. But you do that several bit trips, bit runs per well, it adds up, and that's the level that our organization focuses on efficiency. And we have a lot of Diamondback employees listening into this call this morning, and I want them to hear that I'm proud of that work that they continue to do and deliver those results of four days, 7,500-foot wells that Danny just alluded to.\nCharles Meade : Thank you, Travis. It reminds me that's saying what gets measured gets done. But second question, and this kind of gets to the capital structure question. I wanted to ask how you view the decision or the trade-off between that the share buybacks and the note buybacks? I'd like to see those no buybacks, and it looks like you guys did some good prices, but sometimes that could perhaps get lost in the -- because it's not technically cash returns to shareholders, but it is a return to shareholder. So how do you guys approach that that look on buying back notes versus shares?\nTravis Stice : Let me talk to you about how we discussed it at the Board level. The primary form of shareholder return is in our base dividend. And we put that in place to be not only a sustainable, but a growing base dividend. And as I talked about earlier this quarter, we increased our base dividend another 5%. And so as you look into the future, that base dividend will remain of paramount importance to us, and we believe that we have that base dividend covered down to $40 a barrel of oil. So I'll just give you some confidence as to that base dividend. The second piece of the equation is share buybacks, and share buybacks are determined based on our future expectation of future cash flows and turned into a stock price so that we can measure where we want to repurchase shares back. And so you can tell from the last several quarters, the fact that we've leaned in all of our discretionary free cash flow after our base dividend to repurchase shares. And in a general sense and not specific, because everybody wants to know what stock price we're using, which we won't say until the quarter is behind us. But the lower the stock price, the more you get share repurchases. The higher the stock price, you tend to purchase less. So I hope that makes sense. And then anything left over from that calculus, Charles, is going to be distributed in the form of a variable dividend because we made a commitment to our owners that we would return 75% of our free cash flow. So I hope that makes sense.\nCharles Meade : Thank you for that elaboration. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra from Benchmark Company. The line is now open.\nSubash Chandra: Hi. Good morning, everyone. The first question is how you think of oil cuts going forward into '24? Is that a function of maybe the zones you're drilling or just spatially where the acreage is located? Or perhaps other factors like gas capture, et cetera?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question. Listen, we're allocating a lot of capital to the Northern Midland Basin where it's very oily particularly early time. I think we kind of guide people to 59%, 60% oil. I think that's probably a fairly good baseline for the next few years. In a world where we're not growing as much, that oil cut stays flat and comes down slightly because the oil declined a little faster than the gas piece. But generally, we had a couple of higher gas cut wells in the Delaware Basin in the beginning of this year that boosted the gas production as a company. But overall, kind of high 50s, 60% in a good quarter would be a good range for oil cut.\nSubash Chandra: Right. Terrific. And the follow-up is, I guess, on asset sales. So they've been largely midstream. How do you think the market now is for upstream assets now that oil has returned back to 80 in the bid ask? And in the cash flow statement, I think there was $140 million, $150 million of asset purchases. Just curious if that's just a flow -- overflow from the first quarter on deals announced already or just immaterial acquisitions?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I'll take that two ways. Generally, on the purchase side, we've been doing a little bit of leasing as well as a little bit of netting up. We try to make our asset teams involved in BD. They're making offers on undeveloped interests and those non-op pieces that we don't own in our development. So they're doing work there. We've been looking at leasing some of the deeper rights in the Midland Basin across some of our positions, so that's tied to some of those purchases in the cash flow statement. And then on the divestiture side, we've divested a good amount of what we deem noncore acreage and acreage that doesn't compete for capital in the next kind of 10 years of development, and have received some good prices there. I'd say we're on the sidelines more on the divestiture side today outside of what would be a very unique offer. Instead, we're more focused on the noncore midstream type divested like the OMOG divestiture we announced this earnings. We didn't increase our noncore asset sale target. We certainly have some more assets that make sense to sell, we'll just most likely be tagging along and not controlling the process.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Your line is now open. \nLeo Mariani : Hi guys.Want to talk a little bit about production here, so second quarter, a very nice beat versus the guidance. I think you guys said that you kind of drilled a record number of wells in the quarter. Looking at third quarter production guide, it does indicate that on a total basis, production should be down a little bit this quarter. Can you just help us kind of think through that dynamic a little bit with kind of record drilling last quarter, but production is coming down? Maybe you guys are kind of holding some wells off in terms of turning them in line until later in the year? What's kind of happening there?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Leo. I kind of see -- we kind of think about the oil guidance is what drives the decisions here at the company. I kind of see Q3 as flat to maybe up a little bit from Q2. But Q2 was a very good quarter from a completions perspective. The drilling side doesn't really drive the production profile. We were probably building a few ducts in the back half of the year to set us up well for the next year. Completion cadence was also high in the first half of the year. I think we completed 89 wells in Q2, come down to kind of 80-ish for Q3 and Q4. So I think, again, the production is the output of smart capital-efficient decisions. If this was 2017 or 2018, we'd be stepping on the accelerator and spending more capital. But instead, we're focused on generating more free cash flow in the second half of the year and returning that cash to shareholders.\nLeo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on capital here. So kind of looking at kind of where you guys were in the second quarter. I mean, it looks like that's going to be the peak. So we should be expecting CapEx to come down, I guess, both in 3Q and in 4Q. How much of that is kind of related to service cost? You just talked about fewer completions in the second half, but is it really fourth quarter where you start to see maybe more service cost benefit? You talked about going from low 700s per foot start the year at a kind of low 6s by the end of the year. So are you starting to get some of that benefit here in 4Q? A similar number of completions, 80, should be down kind of a fair bit on capital here in 4Q? Just help us think of that a little bit.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think right now, we're seeing the benefits of the raw materials decreases coming through the system, mainly pipe, cement, diesel. And now, it's kind of after this call through the -- into Q3 into Q4, some of the true service side rolling through the numbers. As we mentioned, we're a cash CapEx payer, so today, we're paying for activity in June. So we kind of have a good forward outlook that that CapEx is coming down. I think the cost per foot we're seeing on wells put in the ground today is lower even than Q2, and that's all going to translate to a lower average well cost in the -- at the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. \nPaul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys two questions, please. One of your large customers is bragging about how much is their EUR recovery way has improved or is going to improve based on the work that they are doing. Just wondering that, Travis, that in this debate, I mean, are you guys looking into that? Or that -- what does that -- based on today's technology and commodity price, is it economic for you to pursue trying to substantially improve the recoverable way? That's the first question. Second question is on -- yes.\nKaes Van't Hof: Why don't we answer the first one first. I think Diamondback is really a technology company that produces oil, and we spend a lot of time looking at improving EURs, we spend a lot of time looking across the bench-line of what competitors and peers are doing. There's not a ton of secrets in the Permian Basin, so if there is a better mousetrap, we're going to find a way to do it. I think our advantage is that we can do it at a lower cost. So generally, we're constantly pursuing, improving EURs, improving recoveries, improving technologies. You'd expect us to be on our front foot there. I don't think we're going to spend a ton of dollars testing that, but would instead be a fast follower on anything that looks to be working.\nPaul Cheng : Yes. I mean based on what you can see today on the technology and the current pricing, is it profitable that you pursue such activities?\nKaes Van't Hof: I don't think it's possible today. I certainly think there's some people spending money to look at it. But for us, we really want to allocate capital to the best returning projects that we have today. And that for us is high-return, multi-zone development in the Midland Basin.\nPaul Cheng : Great. The second question is on the lateral length You guys have been very successful, continue to lengthen it. I think the third quarter is expecting about 10,800 feet. Based on your existing land position in your portfolio, do you think that there's far more room for you to [indiscernible] is going to be able to push substantially higher than here? Or that we are pretty close to the max, unless that there's some meaningful portfolio changes?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think it's a risk-reward decision, Paul. There are certainly some areas where we can drill longer. I think -- but I think generally, the way our land position is laid out and the way our acreage sits today, that 10,000 to 11,000 range feels about right on average. We'd rather drill a 15,000 footer than 2 7,500 footers. But I think today, we'd rather drill 2 10,000 footers versus 1 20,000 footer. So I think the drilling guys can do it on the drilling side. There's no doubt about that. But it's it's a risk-reward decision because if something bad happens at 18,000 feet, that's expensive mistake. So we'd rather continue to get wells down at 10,000 feet in 8, 9 days consistently versus risking a 30, 40-day well when something goes wrong.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice : Appreciate everyone listening in this morning. Good set of questions. I hope you have a fantastic day. If you've got any questions, just reach out to us at the number provided.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, that concludes today's conference.

            "content": "Yes, Arun. I would say 4Q versus 3Q is a combination of lower activity and lower costs going through the system. As you know, we're a cash CapEx payer, so we can see a few months in advance what CapEx is looking like and certainly coming down in the outlines. I would say generally, that's probably the low end of a baseline for the next year. I certainly think that a low 600s a quarter kind of runrate feels okay -- $600 million a quarter run rate feels okay for 2024. It is on the August 1, so we're going to put that in pencil and see where service costs shake out. But certainly, things tend to be moving our way from a well cost perspective. I gave some kind of cost per foot language earlier in the Midland Basin down to the low 600s by the end of the year. Still feels very achievable, and that kind of sets our targets for the upcoming year. Yes, I'd say that today. Obviously, still a lot of things to shake out, but I think the quality of the inventory that we have coming up as well as the high mineral interest in the core of the basin, completely undeveloped sections and units feels like a very capital-efficient plan. We've kind of been highlighting this for the last couple of years. The guide on in QEP transactions provided a lot of undeveloped inventory that we can bring a large-scale execution machine to, and now we're seeing the benefits of those couple of deals. Yes, Derrick. I think generally, we feel very confident in the forward outlook for productivity. I think that's going to be a unique position in North American shale. We've been -- we timed deals very, very well, and we've made the shift to co-development four or five years ago now, and that's resulting in very steady productivity. As you can see within 1% of 2022 levels already in '23. And I would just say flat feels like the baseline, and if it's better than that, that's one for the good guys. Yes. Good question. Listen, we're allocating a lot of capital to the Northern Midland Basin where it's very oily particularly early time. I think we kind of guide people to 59%, 60% oil. I think that's probably a fairly good baseline for the next few years. In a world where we're not growing as much, that oil cut stays flat and comes down slightly because the oil declined a little faster than the gas piece. But generally, we had a couple of higher gas cut wells in the Delaware Basin in the beginning of this year that boosted the gas production as a company. But overall, kind of high 50s, 60% in a good quarter would be a good range for oil cut. Yes. I'll take that two ways. Generally, on the purchase side, we've been doing a little bit of leasing as well as a little bit of netting up. We try to make our asset teams involved in BD. They're making offers on undeveloped interests and those non-op pieces that we don't own in our development. So they're doing work there. We've been looking at leasing some of the deeper rights in the Midland Basin across some of our positions, so that's tied to some of those purchases in the cash flow statement. And then on the divestiture side, we've divested a good amount of what we deem noncore acreage and acreage that doesn't compete for capital in the next kind of 10 years of development, and have received some good prices there. I'd say we're on the sidelines more on the divestiture side today outside of what would be a very unique offer. Instead, we're more focused on the noncore midstream type divested like the OMOG divestiture we announced this earnings. We didn't increase our noncore asset sale target. We certainly have some more assets that make sense to sell, we'll just most likely be tagging along and not controlling the process. Yes, Leo. I kind of see -- we kind of think about the oil guidance is what drives the decisions here at the company. I kind of see Q3 as flat to maybe up a little bit from Q2. But Q2 was a very good quarter from a completions perspective. The drilling side doesn't really drive the production profile. We were probably building a few ducts in the back half of the year to set us up well for the next year. Completion cadence was also high in the first half of the year. I think we completed 89 wells in Q2, come down to kind of 80-ish for Q3 and Q4. So I think, again, the production is the output of smart capital-efficient decisions. If this was 2017 or 2018, we'd be stepping on the accelerator and spending more capital. But instead, we're focused on generating more free cash flow in the second half of the year and returning that cash to shareholders. Yes. I think right now, we're seeing the benefits of the raw materials decreases coming through the system, mainly pipe, cement, diesel. And now, it's kind of after this call through the -- into Q3 into Q4, some of the true service side rolling through the numbers. As we mentioned, we're a cash CapEx payer, so today, we're paying for activity in June. So we kind of have a good forward outlook that that CapEx is coming down. I think the cost per foot we're seeing on wells put in the ground today is lower even than Q2, and that's all going to translate to a lower average well cost in the -- at the end of the year. Why don't we answer the first one first. I think Diamondback is really a technology company that produces oil, and we spend a lot of time looking at improving EURs, we spend a lot of time looking across the bench-line of what competitors and peers are doing. There's not a ton of secrets in the Permian Basin, so if there is a better mousetrap, we're going to find a way to do it. I think our advantage is that we can do it at a lower cost.

            "content": "I think it's premature to call it deflation from where we're headed at the end of the year, Neal. I think high level, we entered the year in the Midland Basin in like in the low 700s a foot, drilling complete and equipped costs, and we'll probably exit the year in the low 600s a foot. Again, we're not calling for a cratering of the service market, we're just calling for a rationalization of it where costs certainly went up into the right for all service lines and raw materials for 7 or 8 quarters, and now that's coming back down to earth a little bit. So we can kind of enter 2024 and rest of 2023 in the low 600s per foot in the Midland Basin. That feels like a pretty good baseline for 2024. Yes. I'll start with the upstream. We drilled a lot of wells in Q2, right. We've drilled a record amount of wells, 98 wells in the quarter. That would imply we're drilling almost 400 wells a year versus guidance at 340; so a lot of pipe in the ground, a lot of -- lot of footage drilled, almost a little over 1 million -- 1.1 million lateral feet. So it was a good quarter operations-wise, which is why we're slowing down the drilling pace in the second half of the year and building a few DUCs, so that's kind of part of the main bump on the DC&E side. And then on the midstream side, we have a lot of infrastructure in the Midland Basin that most of it is -- does have extra capacity. And if the neighbor needs water or needs to dispose the water and we have that capacity, we will spend a few dollars to connect to that person. So a few unique opportunities came up in Martin County throughout the last three or four months, and we're going to spend some dollars to get a lot of barrels, and that's high payback, high-return midstream spend. Yes. I'll kind of highlight what we've done in 2023, and that feels like a good baseline for the floor plan, not forever, but how we think about capital allocation. We have a business where we can run four simul-frac crews efficiently, right? And simul-frac crew on the completion side completes about 80 wells a year. And for us, in this new business model of capital efficiency and profit value over volumes, we're focused on running the most efficient plan possible which would be that four simul-frac crew plan. Absent a major change in commodity price, that's -- the plan is the plan, and that allows the teams to plan their business and also allows us to execute at the lowest cost from a CapEx perspective. So kind of that 15-ish rigs and four simul-frac crews feels like a really good baseline for us. Yes. I think we've seen certainly our year-over-year days reduced by some measurable percentage. And what it boils down to is the team is measuring every little thing they can on the rig and measuring which way those operational metrics are trending. And when one is not trending in the right direction, they attack it with a fervor that is unlike anything I've ever seen, and that continues to output year-over-year improvements in execution. And this past month, we had a couple of wells that they've drilled at their all-time records for us for 7,500-foot laterals that were sub five-day wells for just over four days TD. And those results are remarkable, and we don't talk about individual well results a lot, but those are the things that we continue to do in the day-to-day of the company that can continue to drive our execution downward."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you, Adam. As Adam mentioned, last night we released a shareholder letter in conjunction with our press release, and this is our second quarter in a row we've tried this. I hope you find it useful. We believe that it not only increases the transparency directly to our shareholders but also improves efficiency, and those of you who have followed our story for a long time know how important improving efficiency is to us. So with that, operator, let's move right into questions, if you'll open the line. Neal, Good morning That's a good question. When you look at our business partners on the service side, they have always been responsive to declining and increasing rig count, and the Permian Basin rig count continues to decline. And with the discipline we're seeing across the E&P space with the reluctance to increase spending, we believe that we will continue to see a softening in cost on our -- from our friends on the service side. Now with that, that's only part of the calculus. The other part, which we view more as the variable side, we continue to drive cost out of the equation with increased efficiency. And like we talked about in May, we also see continued input costs coming down on steel, cement and other items. So it's hard to forecast into the future, but we definitely believe that we're going to see a softening in many of the costs that we've seen from the first half of the year. And we also continue to rely on the organization to do things more efficiently, which they continue to do quarter-over-quarter. I'll take those in reverse order. If you're talking about the deals that we did earlier in the year, they've been seamlessly integrated with absolutely no issue. I will say that both of those companies we acquired were running more rigs than we're currently running now, which again continues to be the trend as you see acquisitions occur, operators that are acquiring or dropping rigs as they focus on increased profitability. The landscape, Neil, certainly relative to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, there's just really a few opportunities out there, I mean there was a rush primarily on the private equity side to get deals into the market. And relative to what we see right now, it's very, very limited. As to Fang's roll in M&A, we have created a lot of shareholder value through M&A but our discipline has also been noteworthy as well, too. It's not important to win every deal. It's important to win deals that make us not bigger, but better, and so we'll continue to always hold ourselves accountable to that. But I'll go back to my earlier comment that relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year, it's pretty parsed on a go-forward basis. Sure. The leverage obviously moves around with the oil price, but I think having a leverage ratio of less than one is appropriate for the size and scale of a company of Diamondback size. I do think also with building a little bit of cash on the balance sheet continues to make sense in order to be opportunistic for share repurchases in a countercyclical way. But those are kind of the two inputs that we build our capital structure and return model around. Arun, just as a reminder, we've been guiding for kind of lower CapEx all year long in the back half, and we're seeing it play out now. And as we laid out on Slide 6 of our investor deck, sort of a forecast by quarter of what that looks like. Thanks, Derrick. And Derrick, just to add to that, this profitability model that we've been demonstrating now for multiple quarters in a row and the industry has pivoted to, I hope we have been able to demonstrate that volume growth is an output of efficient capital allocation that's laser-like focused on profitability. So as here on August 1, as we're entertaining questions on 2024, the volume growth will be an output of efficient capital allocation that maximizes the value for our capital allocation decisions. Derrick, we continue to lay out on Slide 16 in this deck what our inventory looks like. And as I look into the future, I couldn't be more confident about the long-term quality of our inventory. And in fact, that confidence in the future business plan is part of the reason that we're confident in being able to increase our base dividend. I mean that's, to me, the clearest indication from management to our owners about the future of our business and the quality of our inventory, is our ability to continually increase our base dividend. I think our quarterly CAGR for dividend increases is around 10% since we initiated it in 2018. So I hope that helps. Charles, I wish I could say it was one individual piece of technology that's transferable across our entire rig fleet, but it's much more subtle than that. And I'm going to let Danny give you some specific examples. But we get this question a lot, and it's always phrased in different ways about why does Diamondback do what they do, but the answer remains unchanged. It's the culture that we have that has an extreme focus on cost control and efficiencies. And the reason that that's important to our culture is because when we make those gains in efficiencies, those gains become permanent in part to our future capital allocation decisions, which makes us more competitive for the same dollar that's that we're competing with relative to our peers. And it's not -- again, it's not one or two items. It's thousands of items that are decided upon every one of these rigs. And look, we have a healthy competition among our rigs and completion crews that we incentivized monetarily for efficiency and cost control measures. And Dan, do you want to add some specifics on that? Charles, just one add to that. We just completed our quarterly reviews several weeks ago, and the teams present to us levels of details of measurement that Daniel was talking about, which is almost stunning to me, but we do it almost every quarter. And that is, they measure how long it takes to physically screw pipe together for 300 times for every trip they have to make. And in that measurement of just simply screwing pipe together in five minutes versus the next rig over that was 6 minutes, you think doesn't matter. But you do that several bit trips, bit runs per well, it adds up, and that's the level that our organization focuses on efficiency. And we have a lot of Diamondback employees listening into this call this morning, and I want them to hear that I'm proud of that work that they continue to do and deliver those results of four days, 7,500-foot wells that Danny just alluded to. Let me talk to you about how we discussed it at the Board level. The primary form of shareholder return is in our base dividend. And we put that in place to be not only a sustainable, but a growing base dividend. And as I talked about earlier this quarter, we increased our base dividend another 5%. And so as you look into the future, that base dividend will remain of paramount importance to us, and we believe that we have that base dividend covered down to $40 a barrel of oil. So I'll just give you some confidence as to that base dividend. The second piece of the equation is share buybacks, and share buybacks are determined based on our future expectation of future cash flows and turned into a stock price so that we can measure where we want to repurchase shares back. And so you can tell from the last several quarters, the fact that we've leaned in all of our discretionary free cash flow after our base dividend to repurchase shares. And in a general sense and not specific, because everybody wants to know what stock price we're using, which we won't say until the quarter is behind us. But the lower the stock price, the more you get share repurchases. The higher the stock price, you tend to purchase less. So I hope that makes sense. And then anything left over from that calculus, Charles, is going to be distributed in the form of a variable dividend because we made a commitment to our owners that we would return 75% of our free cash flow. So I hope that makes sense. Appreciate everyone listening in this morning. Good set of questions. I hope you have a fantastic day. If you've got any questions, just reach out to us at the number provided."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Gina. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's first quarter 2023 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and stockholder letter, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and Adam mentioned that we released a shareholder letter last night in conjunction with our press release. I hope you find that useful. We believe that it not only increases transparency directly to our shareholders, but also improves efficiency. So we'll move right into questions. Operator, if you would open the line and begin with our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann: First, thanks, Travis, for the new format. Appreciate it. Travis, my first questions for you or Danny, on one of the top [indiscernible] that service costs. Specifically, are you able to quantify how your continued operational efficiencies have recently mitigated the cost? And just wondering how you all think about spot versus long-term contracts in the current environment?\nTravis Stice: I think, Neal, the read through that question is, kind of what the CapEx is going to look like in the back half of the year. And I think there's -- and I will let Danny talk about the specific operational efficiencies we've seen year-to-date, that's offset most of the inflationary pressures. But when we talk about deflation, it's really -- that's raw materials. It's diesel, it's sand, it's steel, particularly on steel, because we're buying our steel needs multiple quarters in advance. So we know what that steel cost is. And it's already down for the future purposes $20 to $25 a foot. And then we've also got the rigs we talked about what we\u2019re involved with a couple of rigs, and that allows us to do -- to look at our entire rig fleet and the cost associated with those rigs and we see rig costs are coming down as well. And then lastly, it's -- while it's not necessarily a CapEx issue, we're seeing improved efficiencies as we've got that second e-fleet that's -- that started last week. And we've also got rid of our two spot frac crews and replace them with one simulfrac crew. So we're seeing $10 to $20 a foot efficiency gains there as well. So regardless, Neal, of what's going on with CapEx, our commitment has always been to be the low-cost leader when it comes to prosecuting our development plan out here, and we've got now almost a decade of demonstrating that. So we anticipate that we're going to continue to do that. And that's what our shareholders should be comfortable in. Danny, do you have some additional color for near-term?\nDanny Wesson: No, I think Travis covered everything that we're -- we've kind of seen on the drilling services side and consumable side, on the drilling side, that\u2019s leading us to see leading edge costs coming down. And then on the completion side, just with the additional efficiencies from the additional e-fleet as well as the replacement simulfrac fleet replacing the two traditional zipper fleets that we took over as far as the two acquisitions at the end of the year.\nNeal Dingmann: Great. Thank you for that. And then my second question for Kaes on shareholder return. Kaes, specifically it seems you all plan to stick to or you are sticking to that 75% free cash flow payout. Can you give me your opinion on maybe why not pay more like some peers and on the capital allocation part of the shareholder return, is that plan still just to see what your stock price is doing versus the mid cycle, or how do you determine that?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neal, we always -- when we upped the shareholder return program to 75% of free cash going back to shareholders, we bought the mix of 75% equity and 25% to the balance sheet was a good mix. We still believe that's a good mix. I think when things are going well, like they have in the last couple of years, 75% feels like a max number to go back to equity while continuing to improve the balance sheet. Really the test of this new business model and returns -- return of capital-based business models when things go south in a potential downturn, that's, I think, the time when we should be allocating more capital to buying back shares, reducing the share count a lot more efficiently than it is even when things are going well at today. So we've kept a flexible return of capital program since the beginning. I think we like that. We want to keep that. And Q1 is an exact reason why we maintain that flexibility. We don't want to blow out the balance sheet to buy back stocks, but we also recognize that when your stock is down significantly in the quarter, variable dividend doesn't matter. And that's what we did in Q1 and allocated a lot more cash to the buyback.\nNeal Dingmann: Glad to see it. Thank you all.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Neal.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs & Co. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. And again, thanks for the new format. The first question was around gas price realizations. Obviously, they were soft in the quarter. There's some one-time dynamics it felt like. But just curious on your views on how local gas pricing is going to play out here? And what protections you guys have built in place in order to mitigate pricing negativity?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neil, good question. I think it's two things, right? There's certainly the unhedged realized gas prices for us that were weaker in the quarter relative to the expectations. Really a lot of that comprised a $15 million true-up payment between contracts that moved from selling at the wellhead to taking on our -- taking kind rights downstream. So that's kind of an intercompany issue, but I recognize it did hit gas presence for the quarter. What we've done from a hedging perspective and from a physical perspective to protect against future gas price loss in the basin, which we think there's going to be periodic points of weakness throughout this year and next. We've hedged all of our Waha exposure in the basin, which is about two-thirds of our gas through the end of 2024. And then the other one-third of our gas gets combination of Henry Hub and Houston Ship Channel prices. And then on the Henry Hub side, we have protected with wide collars with a $3 floor, about two-thirds of our gas this year in 2023 and probably a third of it next year. So in general, I think we tried to give the Street some guidance on future unhedged gas realizations and the hedging piece has been a tailwind for us as gas prices weakened both at Henry Hub and in the basin.\nNeil Mehta: Okay. Thanks for that, Kaes. And then just a follow-up on some of the recent acquisitions that you've done here that you've had them in your portfolio now for a couple of months. Just any update on how they're executing early thoughts on productivity and efficiencies that you're able to realize out of the new assets?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, that's a great question as well. I would say, generally, Lario, we knew what we were getting. That asset is nearby all of our existing production in Martin County. So that's as advertised. I think at the end of the day, when we look back at the FireBird acquisition, in a few years that's going to be one of the better value deals we got. We estimated there's almost 500 locations on that acquisition without even pushing the limit on upside locations. And there's been some well tests where we've co-developed the Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A on the southern part of the position that gives us confidence that some of those upside locations are going to become real locations that we are going to develop over time. Second to that, the ops team, they're going into a new area. We are already completing or drilling a 15,000-foot lateral and sub 10 days on the new field. So everything is going well on both those deals. I would say, generally, over time, FireBird will prove to be one of the better deals we did because of the amount of acreage that came with it and the upside from a geologic perspective.\nNeil Mehta: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, guys. We do appreciate the new format. So that was really helpful. My first question is on CapEx. Your first half CapEx guidance plus the 1Q actual implies around $1.36 billion in spending or about 52% of the budget. You talked about having line of sight to some meaningful declines in service costs. So I was wondering maybe Kaes, if you could describe your confidence on hitting, call it, the midpoint of the range of $2.6 billion for the full year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes.\nArun Jayaram: And how does your cash -- I know you account for CapEx on a cash basis versus accrual basis. How does that influence the timing of CapEx in a rising service price environment versus when it's falling?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question, Arun. On the cash CapEx thing, the prime example was Q2 of 2020, while I don't want to relive that particular quarter, we reduced our rig count from 15 -- or 23 rigs down to 6, and we had to pay for that in the second quarter. So there's a big disconnect between accrued and cash CapEx. Now that's not the issue we faced here, right? We are talking about things at the margin like a $50 million or so reduction in run rate CapEx, which is, in my mind, very achievable based on three things: lower activity, we are going to reduce our rig count by 2 rigs as expected at the end of this quarter through the back half of the year. Second, lower service costs and Travis broke those down into the drilling side, which is a significant reduction in raw materials and a smaller reduction in the service piece of the drilling side. And on the other side of that DC&E line completions down because of efficiencies because of the high grading to two zones [ph] fleets with Halliburton and two simulfrac fleets. And lastly, midstream infrastructure. We spent a lot of money on midstream, building out our Martin County water system that's nearing its end, so that the whole system is connected and infrastructure generally slows down in the back half of the year. So that's the line of sight we have. We feel very confident that those things are coming our way based on what we can see in the accrued numbers that we pay for over the next 45 to 60 days on the cash side and CapEx.\nTravis Stice: Yes. And just again to -- Arun to reiterate my opening comment to the first question is that our commitment to our shareholders remain unchanged to be the low-cost leader in efficiency and in execution. And it's certainly been our track record, and that's what we anticipate going forward. But our commitment hasn't changed regardless of what CapEx does.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot, Travis. My follow-up, team, we've heard about some industry activity and leasing in the Midland Basin in deeper zones. Can you remind us how your leases are structured? Do you have rights to those zones currently? And perhaps this obviously could have some positive implications for VNOM. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how FANG's leases are structured and maybe positive implications for VNOM?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. There's really no one size fits all to leases in the Midland Basin. I would say generally, we have most of our leases cover the Wolfcamp B, which is a deeper zone that's going to get a lot more attention over the coming years and some to a lesser extent, we have the Barnett and Woodford covered now. We've been exploring the Barnett and Woodford on the Eastern - on the Western side of the Midland Basin for a very long time now with our Limelight play. It seems that the Barnett and Woodford Play is going to extend more into the actual basin, and that's something that we're involved in, along with many other large peers testing that zone and looking at it for future development in the end of this decade, into the next decade. We'll say, generally, that's the benefit of owning a lot of minerals is that we have the other side of our business card that is going to have a front seat to leasing any of those deeper rights should they be unleased throughout the basin.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Arun.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning. Turning back to service rates, the service companies have been talking about a bifurcated market here for both rigs and frac pumps and their characterization is that the highly efficient crews, the next-gen kit, especially nat gas fuel rigs and pumps will largely maintain pricing, while it's going to be the legacy equipment and/or lower quality crews where you'll see the more meaningful declines in rates. Is that how you see the market developing here? Or do you see more broad-based reductions in pricing kind of across this spectrum?\nKaes Van't Hof: Scott, I think that's partially true. Certainly, on the frac side, the higher quality equipment, the superspec e-fleet those have real contracts associated with them with less global room on pricing. So that's why we think generally, we make more money or save more money there on the efficiency side. On the rig side, I think generally, the 10% of your market is going away in a quarter or 2, it's going to have an impact on pricing. There's just no doubt about that. So leading edge rates certainly are lower. I think we've also proven in the past to do more with less when it comes to equipment on the rig side, particularly in the Midland Basin, where it's a lot easier to drill in general than other places around the country.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then just turning to operating costs, LOE came in at the low end of the range. We kept the full year and then you mentioned the fixed price contracts for power. Just any color that you can provide on how operating costs should evolve over the course of the year, given the outlook for natural gas and power and other things, chemicals, et cetera, go into operating costs?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Look, I think obviously, we had a very good start to the year on LOE. We still feel good about the midpoint of that range mainly because not because of power, but because of some of our activity is moving to areas where we have water dedicated to third parties, not ourselves. And so that has a little higher rate. And so we expect LOE to trend up a little bit in Q2, Q3 as some of those big pads on third-party areas are developed. But generally, we received a benefit in terms of gas prices on the power side to lock in a lot of power. And I would say generally, we've locked in about 75% of our expected power needs for the foreseeable future that should keep LOE generally lower for longer and less exposed to the price spikes that we saw last summer.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color, Kaes. Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Good morning, Travis, Kaes, Danny and team. Thanks for taking my questions today.\nTravis Stice: Sure. Good morning, David.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Morning. Just longer term from an efficiency gains perspective, you all made some headway and you highlighted the benefits of using e-fleets and moving that second e-fleet this year. How do you think about as we progress into '24 and '25, the mix between simulfrac fleet and e-fleets, if we assume sort of this flattish rig count towards the two to two mix, the expectation for longer-term development?\nDanny Wesson: Yes, David, good question. I think our plan right now looking out into '24, '25 is probably to stick with the kind of 50-50 mix. We would basically have to underwrite the e-fleets and sign up for a longer-term commitment with them which is a little harder to do 100% of your capacity committed for a long-term commitment. But the additional simulfrac fleet as more e-fleets come to market and are available in a, I guess, spot basis, we would certainly migrate to more e-fleets that we have some flexibility around utilization.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Got it. And then my second question just around asset sales. You already did around $773 million or so the date you point out that you've exceeded your target. You guys also highlight the remaining five or so outstanding investments that you're articulating on slide back in the back, mostly on the midstream side might be a source of funds going forward. Could you place like -- is there a high probability that we'll see another asset sale this year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I would place a pretty high probability on that, David. We wouldn't have increased our target from $500 million to $1 billion of noncore divestitures if we didn't have a pretty good line of sight. I can't guarantee it's going to happen today, but certainly there's a few things in the works, either on the JV side or some of the small operated midstream assets that could be up for sale. So we still feel very comfortable with that $1 billion target. I would just say it's tailored more towards midstream versus upstream.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Appreciate it. Thanks for the time guys.\nTravis Stice: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nKaes Van't Hof: Rod, you're on mute if you're on the line.\nTravis Stice: So let's move to the next question, please.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin MacCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\nKevin MacCurdy: Hey, good morning. With the 1Q release, you've kind of given the pictures to figure out what the 4Q '22 or '23 CapEx and activity is. As we look into potential 2024 maintenance CapEx program, is the 4Q activity kind of a good activity and CapEx is a good starting point? Or would you need to add any activity to keep production flat next year?\nKaes Van't Hof: That's a good question, Kevin. I'm not fully ready to commit to 2024 today. But I would say, if we had to commit today, running some sort of plan with for simulfrac crews is probably the most efficient and capital efficient plan we can put together. Now whether that spits out slight growth to flat production is to be determined. But I think generally running this capital efficient plan without changing activity levels too much and letting growth be the output has been, I think, rewarded over the last couple of years with this new business model, and that's kind of where we are circling things going forward.\nKevin MacCurdy: Great. That\u2019s the only question for me. Thanks guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Kevin.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDerrick Whitfield: Good morning all and congrats on a strong start to the year.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Derrick.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Derrick.\nDerrick Whitfield: Building on an earlier question on Waha price weakness, could you perhaps elaborate on the degree of tightness you're projecting with in-basin fundamentals?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Derrick, good question. I think generally, we are going to see very -- a lot of volatility and some pockets of extreme weakness. Obviously, there's a few expansions coming on, three expansions in the back half of this year and the beginning of next year, ahead of a large flat coming on at the end of 2024. I just think there -- the issue to date had been masked in the field as processing capacity in the field was short. Now that that processing capacity is coming on, the tune of bcf a day or more that's going to push the problem downstream to the downstream residue pipes. So I think it's coming, it's going to be pretty weak for periods and then pressure will be relieved a little bit when these expansions come on. But generally, our take is, let's remove our risk to that pricing weakness by hedging everything through 2024 and getting more physical molecules for the Gulf Coast. Ideally, we'd like to have control of all of our molecules to the Gulf Coast, but most of our contracts we inherited from deals that we bought have not come with taking kind rights, and we've worked to improve that over time and control more of our molecules further downstream.\nDerrick Whitfield: Great. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on well productivity, which has been a positive development for you guys. Referencing Slide 14, could you speak to your expectations for 2023 well productivity relative to 2022? And how does that project over the next couple of years as you think about the integration of Lario and FireBird acquisitions?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question. I think we said multiple times to investors, flat to 2022 is probably the base case, and we do a little better. That's one for the good guys. I think we are on pace for that, particularly in the Midland Basin where we've had a really strong start to the year. And I would just say FireBird and Lario only enhance that ability to do that for longer. At the end of the day, as we've said before, the shale cost curve is going up. It's our job to make sure we have the inventory duration and the cost structure to be at the low end of that shale cost curve, which we've done well for the last 10 years, and we expect to do well for the next 10 years.\nDerrick Whitfield: Well done, guys.\nTravis Stice: Yes, Derrick, I think just to reiterate that point that I've made a couple of times now about Diamondback's commitment to our shareholders about maintaining the lead and efficiency and cost execution. It's exactly what Kaes just said.\nDerrick Whitfield: Thanks for the added color, Travis.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nScott Hanold: Hey, thanks. Could you all provide a little bit of color on the cadence of activity moving forward? I mean you all talk about having some larger pads going forward. And you all have had a very smooth production trajectory. Does some of these large pads, will that create some lumpiness? Or is there some timing considerations we need to think about as we see those being developed?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Good question, Scott. I would say internally, it certainly does. This business is not easy to grow consistently and hit numbers consistently. But externally, we think we are going to grow fairly smoothly organically through the back half of the year. In general, our target is to turn about 85 wells to sales a quarter, some quarters are going to be a little higher, some are a little lower based on timing. But in general, that's our job, right. It's -- there's a lot going on beneath the surface, and that's what makes the Diamondback operations team the best in the business.\nScott Hanold: Great. And then if we could talk about M&A a little bit. And it looks like some of the private equity companies are dropping rigs in the Permian. And obviously there have been some sales and talks of more sales coming up. Like what are you all seeing on the private side in terms of activity? And what's your interest level in looking at some of additional M&A opportunities?\nTravis Stice: Yes, we've commented a couple of times about the increase in activity through 2022 was largely driven by independents and the challenge there is depth of inventory, right? And the secondary challenge is how much can increase further beyond their max cadence that they achieved last year. And I think both of those are playing out now. The max cadence may be softening, as you see by rigs getting laid down. And certainly, the inventory depth is getting accelerated with this rapid pace of bringing wells to production. So I think from an M&A perspective, it's going to be an interesting time over the next couple of years as these entities, the small ones, private, just try to figure out a way to monetize. And I think you've also got while their catalyst is unclear, you've also got some small cap public companies that are going to need to figure out some form of exit strategy to be -- continue to be relevant in the future. And then there's always the large private unicorns that's still flowing around out there as well, too. So I really think the next couple of years are going to be interesting in the M&A landscape.\nScott Hanold: Yes. So do you believe though that some of these private equities that have burned through a lot of their acreage? Does that make -- does the inventory factor make it less interesting to you all? Or is there a case to be made if you can buy PDPs cheap enough and kind of manage them down there in interest?\nTravis Stice: Well, Scott, when you do M&A, and if you do it correctly, you want to extend inventory life, you want to make sure that your free cash flow or cash flow accretive and you don't want to impact your balance sheet. So just doing PDP type acquisitions doesn't necessarily fit into that calculus, but it's -- I think that's what you're going to end up seeing with some of these exit strategies or just kind of straight PDP divestitures.\nScott Hanold: Fair enough. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of TPH. Your line is now open.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions.\nTravis Stice: Hi, Jeff.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: The first one is just on commentary and the supplemental release that talked about the trend continuing this year in terms of the large high NRI pads coming on in the Northern Midland Basin. Is there any additional color you can give there in terms of how the mix of the total program going to that type of acreage where you might have much less surrounding development compares to that same mix or waiting to that type of acreage last year and just how to think about that mix over the near-term?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, good question, Jeff. I would say the mix of undeveloped DSUs is probably similar to years past. Now the quality of the location of those undeveloped DSUs is probably a little bit higher this year than in 2022 even. So it was kind of related to our comment on productivity. There's certainly a line of sight to very high productivity this year from development in the middle of Martin County and some of that, we have up to a 6% or 7% NRI on large pads at the Viper level. And so because we report consolidated financials, that is a benefit to the total enterprise, where the high-end development is going to drive organic production growth at the entity.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Great. I appreciate that. And then on the services side, I certainly appreciate the detail just around where you see potential improvements and the timing around that throughout the year. I was just hoping you could speak maybe high-level to how your contracts are set up, I guess, across the services spectrum just to give a sense for how some of these improvements will layer in from Diamondback specifically over the course of the next couple of quarters?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I'd say on the rig size, everything is kind of a rolling 3 to 6-month contracts. So we see -- we can see that our Q2 average day rate is down from Q1 today. And so that's going to continue to come our way on the rig side. On the frac side, our two e-fleets on the simulfrac e-fleets are pretty locked up on pricing. I would say we saw some weakness in the spot frac pricing in Q1 versus Q4. And as we move those other two fleets to simulfrac fleets, I think the more benefit will be on the efficiency side than the price per horsepower side. But generally, a simulfrac fleet saves up $20 or $30 a foot regardless of the price of actual horsepower.\nTravis Stice: Jeff, in addition to that, we talked earlier about purchasing steel multiple quarters in advance. So we are seeing the steel that we are purchasing for our 3Q, 4Q, 1Q costs already coming down. And so while it's not necessarily a service cost deflation, it is a cost deflation that could be as much as $20 or $25 a foot additionally.\nJeoffrey Lambujon: Appreciate it guys. Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJohn Freeman: Good morning, guys.\nTravis Stice: Hey, John.\nJohn Freeman: You all had -- in fourth quarter, when you all are running ahead of schedule and you moved some of those POPs from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, and just given all the commentary on the big efficiency gains on the final fracs as you now go to towards four with funnel fracability, if we end up in a similar spot where you have efficiency gains later this year, is it likely that you all -- and again, it's a first class problem, but would you similarly make a decision like last year where you would sort of, I don't know, pump the brakes is the right word, but maybe slowdown in touch so that the budget is intact? Or do you just sort of plow ahead with the efficiency gains and just bring more wells online?\nKaes Van't Hof: No. Listen, I think we are highly incentivized to hit the budget. I think high incentivized to increase free cash flow, which is part of the new business model, which has used growth for returns, and that's been the mentality. It's been a working mentality that has worked for the last couple of years. So it would be a first class problem. We are still early in the year, but generally that would be the plan now. I think the only nuance to that is we would like to keep rigs running and building DUCs, particularly if rig costs are a little bit lower than they are today.\nJohn Freeman: That's great. And then I really appreciate all the detail and color you've given on the service cost front. So does it sound like -- obviously, things are coming down from the peak levels of 1Q, but is it -- are you all basically indicating that you are on track to potentially have lower total completed well costs by year-end '23 versus year-end '22. Like when you factor in what you're seeing on the cost side, but maybe more importantly the efficiency gains from the simulfracs?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I would say, yes, that's a fair answer. I mean particularly, listen, steel is the biggest driver. I'm not -- we are not forecasting a total capitulation in service costs here. But when steel went up for nine quarters in a row to over $110 a foot, we see in Q3, our steel costs are going to be closer to $90 a foot. So I mean that in itself makes up for a significant percentage of the savings. So I would say, yes, Q4 2023 well costs below Q4 2022 because generally, Q4 '22 and Q1 '23 were the highest.\nJohn Freeman: That\u2019s great. I appreciate it guys.\nTravis Stice: John, listen, just to reemphasize, we run the business to maximize efficiency as well. And so Kaes made the point that whether it's on the rig side or the completion side, we are about efficiency because we think that that's the greatest driver of shareholder value in a business where you don't control the price of the product that you produce.\nJohn Freeman: Thanks, Travis.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nTim Rezvan: Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back Dave's questions previously on asset sales. I'm sure you won't give a good answer on the Bloomberg story about Pecos County. But I think it highlights the number of levers that you can pull to get to $1 billion or more on asset sales. So trying to understand, Kaes, what do you think a good kind of target debt level is? Do you think about it in terms of leverage or an absolute debt metric as you compare yourselves to the large cap peers? And I guess why wouldn't you go bigger than that $1 billion given you're not allocating a lot of capital to the Delaware right now?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Tim, that's a good question. I'm not going to go bigger because we want to beat the number, first of all. But second to that, listen, the Delaware Basin overall still produces a lot of barrels and a lot of cash flow for us. And that's important to the credit ratings. It's important to our free cash flow forecast and all of the above. So I think we have sold a few small things in the Delaware on the acreage side. And the recurring theme of what we sold is that someone paid for upside. So we are not going to sell PDP cheap just to sell PDP. At the end of the day, someone has to pay for upside and pay for a faster pace of development than we were expecting. And that, I think, has been a common theme in the Delaware deals as well as the deal in Glasscock County, not only they pay for PDP, but they paid for some PUDs that didn't compete for us in the next 10 years plan. So if that happens, then we'll look at -- do what's right for our shareholders and look at divesting more in the Delaware Basin. But generally, that production and cash flow has a lot of value to us today.\nTim Rezvan: Okay. And then just getting back to that number in an ideal world, how do you think about what the right debt number is, whether either in debt or in leverage terms for [multiple speakers]?\nKaes Van't Hof: Sorry, I apologize, I forgot to reply to that part of the question. I think we think about that in terms of -- two ways to think about it, right. Not only absolute debt and the leverage ratio, but also duration. And I think we obviously want less debt over time, but we feel comfortable with the amount of duration we have between now and our next maturity, which is 2026. So I'd like to take that out so that Travis won't bother me about it until 2029. And -- but when we have excess free cash flow, we are going to use it to reduce absolute debt. I think in a perfect world, a turn of leverage at a $55 or $50 oil price would be, in my mind, an ideal debt level with no debt due for multiple years before next maturity.\nTim Rezvan: Okay. I appreciate the color. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade: Good day, Travis, Kaes and to the rest of Diamondback team there.\nKaes Van't Hof: Hey, Charles.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Travis, this may be for you. I like the new format as well, but the -- I was also thinking about the shareholder letter. And Travis, in your prepared comments, I think you said you were hoping this format would be more efficient to pick up on a big thing for you this morning. But I was wondering also, does this -- the iteration on your communication style, I mean, does this also reflect an element of maybe dissatisfaction with how either your story is being understood or the traction that you're getting or that you maybe feel like [technical difficulty] that you're not? And if that is true or if that's the case that there's some element of it, what do you think the market might be missing?\nTravis Stice: No, we didn't put this letter in place trying to fix the communication issue. We've got an incredible transparency communication format that we have with our shareholders. We just thought that based on a decade of doing these earnings calls and the lack of attention really paid in the prepared remarks, felt like we could remove that. And we also know that other industries are well ahead of the oil and gas sector by not doing prepared remarks. The other thing is that we could communicate more in this shareholder letter than what we traditionally would put in a truncated CEO quote in the earnings release. And then we didn't have to have anybody spending Sunday night preparing our transcript either as well, too. So I mean, from a staff perspective, there's a lot more efficient there. So no, we did this because we think it's a better way to communicate, not that we need to improve the message or the understanding in our stock price.\nKaes Van't Hof: I think it also allows us to talk directly to our shareholders, right? Because a lot of the times, the sell side is in control and narrative and this allows us to -- so a little bit of the story behind the numbers directly to our shareholders.\nCharles Meade: Insight into your thinking. I appreciate that. And, Kaes, I want to go back to the question on the buybacks. I know this has been addressed at least in one other earlier question. But all other things being equal, I know I recognize they never are, but all other things being equal, is the shift to buybacks that we saw in 1Q, does that kind of signal a durable shift? Or if not a durable shift to durable change in the preference towards buybacks?\nKaes Van't Hof: Listen, I think our preference has always been to buy back shares. Now what we wanted was a governor on what fundamentally are we buying back shares for? Are we buying back oil in the market cheaper than we can buy it in the ground? And that's our NAV versus looking at a deal like Lario or FireBird. So at the end of the day, we are still going to run our NAV at a conservative mid cycle deck, which is $60 oil. And the market has presented us opportunities to buy back shares every quarter since we started this buyback program. So at the end of the day, again, our preference is buybacks, but we have a little bit of a governor on what share price we are going to be aggressive on and Q1 was the perfect example of that.\nTravis Stice: And Charles, we've tried to be mindful of sins of the past, our industry has been known for, which is oil price goes high, free cash flow goes up and share repurchases are done not counter cyclically like we are trying to do so, but in cycle with higher oil prices and that hasn't created a lot of value. So we may not always be perfect in the calculus, but as Kaes pointed out, whether it's the banking crisis here recently or other forms of volatility, we've had an opportunity to purchase $2 billion worth of shares back at roughly $120 a share. So we feel like we are following through on our commitment of not only being flexible in our return program, but also being mindful of the method and the timing at which you repurchase shares.\nCharles Meade: Thank you gentlemen. Appreciate the color.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Roger.\nKaes Van't Hof: Hi, Roger.\nRoger Read: Let's dig into the service cost in deflation, I guess, we could call it at this point. We haven't so used to using inflation. Can you talk to us a little bit as you think about well costs being lower in the fourth quarter, how much of that is efficiencies and how much of that is just a decline in the cost of doing something being drilling rigs or whatever? 50-50, 60-40, 80-20, something like that as well. I was curious.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I would say it's a quarter efficiencies and 75% actual costs. Now of the 75%, I would say two-thirds of that is due to raw materials and a third -- and the other third is due to the actual service piece of the equation.\nRoger Read: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And then the other follow-up question I had was, is there any sort of rule of thumb approach you use as you switch to fleets? Or as you went from the zipper frac to the simulfrac in terms of how do you want to think about it, stages per day, cost per stage, something like that? Again, just trying to understand some of these changes as they get applied all across the entire complex.\nKaes Van't Hof: I will give you the cost estimates, and Danny can give you the efficiencies. I said, generally, a simulfrac fleet is $20 to $30 a foot cheaper than a conventional fleet and an e-fleet is $20 to $30 a foot cheaper than a simulfrac fleet.\nDanny Wesson: Yes. I mean an e-fleet towards utilizing our simulfrac fleets, they're just powered with electric power that we generate on location or that we pull off the grid. So really, the savings on the e-fleet comes from the fuel consumption piece and just being more efficient on location. We do think we see a little bit of disparity between the kind of lateral footage completed per day by the e-fleet versus the diesel simulfrac fleets, but we don't have a just a ton of data yet to quantify that, but we are hopeful that over time, the e-fleets will kind of widen the gap of execution efficiency just because of the lower maintenance and R&M stuff that's required on location.\nTravis Stice: Danny, the difference between zipper and simulfrac in terms of footage per day yield.\nDanny Wesson: Yes, I mean -- so we kind of say simulfrac fleet depending on the jobs can do about twice as much lateral footage per day as a traditional zipper fleet.\nRoger Read: Yes. So very, very large differences. One, just a little clarification on your comments very beginning about locking in some of your electricity costs, being able to predict your LOEs a little better during the summer. Is there any interruptible risk with those contracts? I mean I'm not talking outages, which would affect everybody, but just to get the lower cost or fixed cost, you have to accept the risk of being turned off?\nDanny Wesson: No. It's just a hedge in the market. So it's just a financial hedge, not a physical trade.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani: I just wanted to follow-up quickly on LOE. I just wanted to clarify one of your earlier comments. It sounds like you guys are expecting LOE per barrel decline here in 2Q and 3Q versus where you were in 1Q. Just wanted to make sure I sort of heard that right?\nKaes Van't Hof: No, we expect it to go up to the midpoint of guidance from $5 to midpoint of $5 to $5.50. So going up slightly due to third-party water handling.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. And you're viewing that is somewhat temporary just based on where the rigs are going to be sort of be drilling location wise here in the middle part of the year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, just dependent upon where the completions are. The completions are on a third-party dedicated piece of acreage. The cost is higher than it would have been on a prior Rattler [ph] dedicated piece of acreage.\nLeo Mariani: Right. Okay. And then just on cash taxes. Looking at first quarter, you guys kind of came in below the guidance. So far, I guess, quarter-to-date here in 2Q, commodity prices are kind of flat to down. You guys are expecting cash taxes to kind of increase here in 2Q per the guidance. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color in terms of how the year plays out? I mean do you generally see cash taxes increasing throughout the year? And maybe that just has to do with NOLs that are completely disappearing in your other tax shield that disappears. But -- any other color kind of around that cadence of cash taxes as the year progresses?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think the only real added benefit that Q1 had versus Q2, even if commodity prices were flat is that we closed Lario in the quarter and got to write-off some of that, the hard assets that came with that right away.\nLeo Mariani: All right. So it sounds like it's just M&A driven on the tax shield side and now maybe 2Q is more of a normal representative rate going forward?\nKaes Van't Hof: That's fair.\nLeo Mariani: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our final question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: I just want to add my appreciation with the new format, I think that's great. Two questions, please. First, you've been increasing your overall activity in the Midland over the last several years. So now it's 85%, 15% between the two. Should we assume this is going to be pretty steady and stable for the next several years or that you may start to doing more [indiscernible] maybe sometime over the next 1 or 2 years?\nKaes Van't Hof: I think over the next few years, the 85%, 15% is a very fair yearly estimate. Obviously, some quarters will be higher than others. We want to continue to complete multi-well pads in the Delaware. So you have a quarter like Q1 of 2023, which was higher Delaware when Q4 was 0 wells in the Delaware. But on an annual basis, 85%, 15% feels like the right lateral footage mix.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. And the second question is that you talked about the budget. You feel very comfortable about the midpoint of the full year. Just curious that in that budget, how much is the cost saving or that the -- you're talking about the line of sight of the cost is coming down. How much of them is already or regionally building into that budget? Or that in other words, was that a reasonable probability, you're actually going to be below the midpoint of your budget?\nKaes Van't Hof: I don't know if I'm ready to commit to that today, Paul. We certainly have some work to do, but we have very good line of sight from an activity and a cost perspective that we've seen the peak in well costs and a little bit of a tailwind from the activity of 2 rigs coming down. Now I think that will happen a little bit in Q3 and more in Q4, but it's still early.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. Can you share with us that, I mean, how much of the saving your rate, generally, $1 billion? Or how much is the deflation in the second half that you have [indiscernible] into your budget?\nKaes Van't Hof: I would say if we saw more service cost deflation that would be upside to what we've modeled here.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. [Indiscernible].\nKaes Van't Hof: [Indiscernible] not raw materials.\nPaul Cheng: Okay. [Indiscernible]. Thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn it over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you for joining us this morning. I think another benefit of this new format is to allow more questions based on the amount of questions we had this morning. So, if you have any additional follow-up that you need, just reach out to us using the numbers that we provided earlier. Thanks again for joining. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes, Neal, we always -- when we upped the shareholder return program to 75% of free cash going back to shareholders, we bought the mix of 75% equity and 25% to the balance sheet was a good mix. We still believe that's a good mix. I think when things are going well, like they have in the last couple of years, 75% feels like a max number to go back to equity while continuing to improve the balance sheet. Really the test of this new business model and returns -- return of capital-based business models when things go south in a potential downturn, that's, I think, the time when we should be allocating more capital to buying back shares, reducing the share count a lot more efficiently than it is even when things are going well at today. So we've kept a flexible return of capital program since the beginning. I think we like that. We want to keep that. And Q1 is an exact reason why we maintain that flexibility. We don't want to blow out the balance sheet to buy back stocks, but we also recognize that when your stock is down significantly in the quarter, variable dividend doesn't matter. And that's what we did in Q1 and allocated a lot more cash to the buyback. Yes, Neil, good question. I think it's two things, right? There's certainly the unhedged realized gas prices for us that were weaker in the quarter relative to the expectations. Really a lot of that comprised a $15 million true-up payment between contracts that moved from selling at the wellhead to taking on our -- taking kind rights downstream. So that's kind of an intercompany issue, but I recognize it did hit gas presence for the quarter. What we've done from a hedging perspective and from a physical perspective to protect against future gas price loss in the basin, which we think there's going to be periodic points of weakness throughout this year and next. We've hedged all of our Waha exposure in the basin, which is about two-thirds of our gas through the end of 2024. And then the other one-third of our gas gets combination of Henry Hub and Houston Ship Channel prices. And then on the Henry Hub side, we have protected with wide collars with a $3 floor, about two-thirds of our gas this year in 2023 and probably a third of it next year. So in general, I think we tried to give the Street some guidance on future unhedged gas realizations and the hedging piece has been a tailwind for us as gas prices weakened both at Henry Hub and in the basin. Yes, that's a great question as well. I would say, generally, Lario, we knew what we were getting. That asset is nearby all of our existing production in Martin County. So that's as advertised. I think at the end of the day, when we look back at the FireBird acquisition, in a few years that's going to be one of the better value deals we got. We estimated there's almost 500 locations on that acquisition without even pushing the limit on upside locations. And there's been some well tests where we've co-developed the Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A on the southern part of the position that gives us confidence that some of those upside locations are going to become real locations that we are going to develop over time. Second to that, the ops team, they're going into a new area. We are already completing or drilling a 15,000-foot lateral and sub 10 days on the new field. So everything is going well on both those deals. I would say, generally, over time, FireBird will prove to be one of the better deals we did because of the amount of acreage that came with it and the upside from a geologic perspective. Thank you, Neil. Yes. Yes. Good question, Arun. On the cash CapEx thing, the prime example was Q2 of 2020, while I don't want to relive that particular quarter, we reduced our rig count from 15 -- or 23 rigs down to 6, and we had to pay for that in the second quarter. So there's a big disconnect between accrued and cash CapEx. Now that's not the issue we faced here, right? We are talking about things at the margin like a $50 million or so reduction in run rate CapEx, which is, in my mind, very achievable based on three things: lower activity, we are going to reduce our rig count by 2 rigs as expected at the end of this quarter through the back half of the year. Second, lower service costs and Travis broke those down into the drilling side, which is a significant reduction in raw materials and a smaller reduction in the service piece of the drilling side. And on the other side of that DC&E line completions down because of efficiencies because of the high grading to two zones [ph] fleets with Halliburton and two simulfrac fleets. And lastly, midstream infrastructure. We spent a lot of money on midstream, building out our Martin County water system that's nearing its end, so that the whole system is connected and infrastructure generally slows down in the back half of the year. So that's the line of sight we have. We feel very confident that those things are coming our way based on what we can see in the accrued numbers that we pay for over the next 45 to 60 days on the cash side and CapEx. Yes. There's really no one size fits all to leases in the Midland Basin. I would say generally, we have most of our leases cover the Wolfcamp B, which is a deeper zone that's going to get a lot more attention over the coming years and some to a lesser extent, we have the Barnett and Woodford covered now. We've been exploring the Barnett and Woodford on the Eastern - on the Western side of the Midland Basin for a very long time now with our Limelight play. It seems that the Barnett and Woodford Play is going to extend more into the actual basin, and that's something that we're involved in, along with many other large peers testing that zone and looking at it for future development in the end of this decade, into the next decade. We'll say, generally, that's the benefit of owning a lot of minerals is that we have the other side of our business card that is going to have a front seat to leasing any of those deeper rights should they be unleased throughout the basin. Scott, I think that's partially true. Certainly, on the frac side, the higher quality equipment, the superspec e-fleet those have real contracts associated with them with less global room on pricing. So that's why we think generally, we make more money or save more money there on the efficiency side. On the rig side, I think generally, the 10% of your market is going away in a quarter or 2, it's going to have an impact on pricing. There's just no doubt about that. So leading edge rates certainly are lower. I think we've also proven in the past to do more with less when it comes to equipment on the rig side, particularly in the Midland Basin, where it's a lot easier to drill in general than other places around the country. Yes. Look, I think obviously, we had a very good start to the year on LOE. We still feel good about the midpoint of that range mainly because not because of power, but because of some of our activity is moving to areas where we have water dedicated to third parties, not ourselves. And so that has a little higher rate. And so we expect LOE to trend up a little bit in Q2, Q3 as some of those big pads on third-party areas are developed. But generally, we received a benefit in terms of gas prices on the power side to lock in a lot of power. And I would say generally, we've locked in about 75% of our expected power needs for the foreseeable future that should keep LOE generally lower for longer and less exposed to the price spikes that we saw last summer. Thank you, Scott. Yes. I would place a pretty high probability on that, David. We wouldn't have increased our target from $500 million to $1 billion of noncore divestitures if we didn't have a pretty good line of sight. I can't guarantee it's going to happen today, but certainly there's a few things in the works, either on the JV side or some of the small operated midstream assets that could be up for sale. So we still feel very comfortable with that $1 billion target. I would just say it's tailored more towards midstream versus upstream. Rod, you're on mute if you're on the line. That's a good question, Kevin. I'm not fully ready to commit to 2024 today. But I would say, if we had to commit today, running some sort of plan with for simulfrac crews is probably the most efficient and capital efficient plan we can put together. Now whether that spits out slight growth to flat production is to be determined. But I think generally running this capital efficient plan without changing activity levels too much and letting growth be the output has been, I think, rewarded over the last couple of years with this new business model, and that's kind of where we are circling things going forward. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Derrick. Yes, Derrick, good question. I think generally, we are going to see very -- a lot of volatility and some pockets of extreme weakness. Obviously, there's a few expansions coming on, three expansions in the back half of this year and the beginning of next year, ahead of a large flat coming on at the end of 2024. I just think there -- the issue to date had been masked in the field as processing capacity in the field was short. Now that that processing capacity is coming on, the tune of bcf a day or more that's going to push the problem downstream to the downstream residue pipes. So I think it's coming, it's going to be pretty weak for periods and then pressure will be relieved a little bit when these expansions come on. But generally, our take is, let's remove our risk to that pricing weakness by hedging everything through 2024 and getting more physical molecules for the Gulf Coast. Ideally, we'd like to have control of all of our molecules to the Gulf Coast, but most of our contracts we inherited from deals that we bought have not come with taking kind rights, and we've worked to improve that over time and control more of our molecules further downstream. Yes. Good question. I think we said multiple times to investors, flat to 2022 is probably the base case, and we do a little better. That's one for the good guys. I think we are on pace for that, particularly in the Midland Basin where we've had a really strong start to the year. And I would just say FireBird and Lario only enhance that ability to do that for longer. At the end of the day, as we've said before, the shale cost curve is going up. It's our job to make sure we have the inventory duration and the cost structure to be at the low end of that shale cost curve, which we've done well for the last 10 years, and we expect to do well for the next 10 years. Yes. Good question, Scott. I would say internally, it certainly does. This business is not easy to grow consistently and hit numbers consistently. But externally, we think we are going to grow fairly smoothly organically through the back half of the year. In general, our target is to turn about 85 wells to sales a quarter, some quarters are going to be a little higher, some are a little lower based on timing. But in general, that's our job, right. It's -- there's a lot going on beneath the surface, and that's what makes the Diamondback operations team the best in the business. Yes, good question, Jeff. I would say the mix of undeveloped DSUs is probably similar to years past. Now the quality of the location of those undeveloped DSUs is probably a little bit higher this year than in 2022 even. So it was kind of related to our comment on productivity. There's certainly a line of sight to very high productivity this year from development in the middle of Martin County and some of that, we have up to a 6% or 7% NRI on large pads at the Viper level. And so because we report consolidated financials, that is a benefit to the total enterprise, where the high-end development is going to drive organic production growth at the entity. Yes. I'd say on the rig size, everything is kind of a rolling 3 to 6-month contracts. So we see -- we can see that our Q2 average day rate is down from Q1 today. And so that's going to continue to come our way on the rig side. On the frac side, our two e-fleets on the simulfrac e-fleets are pretty locked up on pricing. I would say we saw some weakness in the spot frac pricing in Q1 versus Q4. And as we move those other two fleets to simulfrac fleets, I think the more benefit will be on the efficiency side than the price per horsepower side. But generally, a simulfrac fleet saves up $20 or $30 a foot regardless of the price of actual horsepower. No. Listen, I think we are highly incentivized to hit the budget. I think high incentivized to increase free cash flow, which is part of the new business model, which has used growth for returns, and that's been the mentality. It's been a working mentality that has worked for the last couple of years. So it would be a first class problem. We are still early in the year, but generally that would be the plan now. I think the only nuance to that is we would like to keep rigs running and building DUCs, particularly if rig costs are a little bit lower than they are today. Yes. I would say, yes, that's a fair answer. I mean particularly, listen, steel is the biggest driver. I'm not -- we are not forecasting a total capitulation in service costs here. But when steel went up for nine quarters in a row to over $110 a foot, we see in Q3, our steel costs are going to be closer to $90 a foot. So I mean that in itself makes up for a significant percentage of the savings. So I would say, yes, Q4 2023 well costs below Q4 2022 because generally, Q4 '22 and Q1 '23 were the highest. Yes, Tim, that's a good question. I'm not going to go bigger because we want to beat the number, first of all. But second to that, listen, the Delaware Basin overall still produces a lot of barrels and a lot of cash flow for us. And that's important to the credit ratings. It's important to our free cash flow forecast and all of the above. So I think we have sold a few small things in the Delaware on the acreage side. And the recurring theme of what we sold is that someone paid for upside. So we are not going to sell PDP cheap just to sell PDP. At the end of the day, someone has to pay for upside and pay for a faster pace of development than we were expecting. And that, I think, has been a common theme in the Delaware deals as well as the deal in Glasscock County, not only they pay for PDP, but they paid for some PUDs that didn't compete for us in the next 10 years plan. So if that happens, then we'll look at -- do what's right for our shareholders and look at divesting more in the Delaware Basin. But generally, that production and cash flow has a lot of value to us today. Sorry, I apologize, I forgot to reply to that part of the question. I think we think about that in terms of -- two ways to think about it, right. Not only absolute debt and the leverage ratio, but also duration. And I think we obviously want less debt over time, but we feel comfortable with the amount of duration we have between now and our next maturity, which is 2026. So I'd like to take that out so that Travis won't bother me about it until 2029. And -- but when we have excess free cash flow, we are going to use it to reduce absolute debt. I think in a perfect world, a turn of leverage at a $55 or $50 oil price would be, in my mind, an ideal debt level with no debt due for multiple years before next maturity. Hey, Charles. I think it also allows us to talk directly to our shareholders, right? Because a lot of the times, the sell side is in control and narrative and this allows us to -- so a little bit of the story behind the numbers directly to our shareholders. Listen, I think our preference has always been to buy back shares. Now what we wanted was a governor on what fundamentally are we buying back shares for? Are we buying back oil in the market cheaper than we can buy it in the ground? And that's our NAV versus looking at a deal like Lario or FireBird. So at the end of the day, we are still going to run our NAV at a conservative mid cycle deck, which is $60 oil. And the market has presented us opportunities to buy back shares every quarter since we started this buyback program. So at the end of the day, again, our preference is buybacks, but we have a little bit of a governor on what share price we are going to be aggressive on and Q1 was the perfect example of that. Hi, Roger. Yes, I would say it's a quarter efficiencies and 75% actual costs. Now of the 75%, I would say two-thirds of that is due to raw materials and a third -- and the other third is due to the actual service piece of the equation. I will give you the cost estimates, and Danny can give you the efficiencies. I said, generally, a simulfrac fleet is $20 to $30 a foot cheaper than a conventional fleet and an e-fleet is $20 to $30 a foot cheaper than a simulfrac fleet. No, we expect it to go up to the midpoint of guidance from $5 to midpoint of $5 to $5.50. So going up slightly due to third-party water handling. Yes, just dependent upon where the completions are. The completions are on a third-party dedicated piece of acreage. The cost is higher than it would have been on a prior Rattler [ph] dedicated piece of acreage. Yes. I think the only real added benefit that Q1 had versus Q2, even if commodity prices were flat is that we closed Lario in the quarter and got to write-off some of that, the hard assets that came with that right away. That's fair. I think over the next few years, the 85%, 15% is a very fair yearly estimate. Obviously, some quarters will be higher than others. We want to continue to complete multi-well pads in the Delaware. So you have a quarter like Q1 of 2023, which was higher Delaware when Q4 was 0 wells in the Delaware. But on an annual basis, 85%, 15% feels like the right lateral footage mix. I don't know if I'm ready to commit to that today, Paul. We certainly have some work to do, but we have very good line of sight from an activity and a cost perspective that we've seen the peak in well costs and a little bit of a tailwind from the activity of 2 rigs coming down. Now I think that will happen a little bit in Q3 and more in Q4, but it's still early. I would say if we saw more service cost deflation that would be upside to what we've modeled here. [Indiscernible] not raw materials. Thank you, Paul."

            "name": "Danny Wesson",
            "content": "No, I think Travis covered everything that we're -- we've kind of seen on the drilling services side and consumable side, on the drilling side, that's leading us to see leading edge costs coming down. And then on the completion side, just with the additional efficiencies from the additional e-fleet as well as the replacement simulfrac fleet replacing the two traditional zipper fleets that we took over as far as the two acquisitions at the end of the year. Yes, David, good question. I think our plan right now looking out into '24, '25 is probably to stick with the kind of 50-50 mix. We would basically have to underwrite the e-fleets and sign up for a longer-term commitment with them which is a little harder to do 100% of your capacity committed for a long-term commitment. But the additional simulfrac fleet as more e-fleets come to market and are available in a, I guess, spot basis, we would certainly migrate to more e-fleets that we have some flexibility around utilization. Yes. I mean an e-fleet towards utilizing our simulfrac fleets, they're just powered with electric power that we generate on location or that we pull off the grid. So really, the savings on the e-fleet comes from the fuel consumption piece and just being more efficient on location. We do think we see a little bit of disparity between the kind of lateral footage completed per day by the e-fleet versus the diesel simulfrac fleets, but we don't have a just a ton of data yet to quantify that, but we are hopeful that over time, the e-fleets will kind of widen the gap of execution efficiency just because of the lower maintenance and R&M stuff that's required on location. Yes, I mean -- so we kind of say simulfrac fleet depending on the jobs can do about twice as much lateral footage per day as a traditional zipper fleet. No. It's just a hedge in the market. So it's just a financial hedge, not a physical trade."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and Adam mentioned that we released a shareholder letter last night in conjunction with our press release. I hope you find that useful. We believe that it not only increases transparency directly to our shareholders, but also improves efficiency. So we'll move right into questions. Operator, if you would open the line and begin with our first question. I think, Neal, the read through that question is, kind of what the CapEx is going to look like in the back half of the year. And I think there's -- and I will let Danny talk about the specific operational efficiencies we've seen year-to-date, that's offset most of the inflationary pressures. But when we talk about deflation, it's really -- that's raw materials. It's diesel, it's sand, it's steel, particularly on steel, because we're buying our steel needs multiple quarters in advance. So we know what that steel cost is. And it's already down for the future purposes $20 to $25 a foot. And then we've also got the rigs we talked about what we're involved with a couple of rigs, and that allows us to do -- to look at our entire rig fleet and the cost associated with those rigs and we see rig costs are coming down as well. And then lastly, it's -- while it's not necessarily a CapEx issue, we're seeing improved efficiencies as we've got that second e-fleet that's -- that started last week. And we've also got rid of our two spot frac crews and replace them with one simulfrac crew. So we're seeing $10 to $20 a foot efficiency gains there as well. So regardless, Neal, of what's going on with CapEx, our commitment has always been to be the low-cost leader when it comes to prosecuting our development plan out here, and we've got now almost a decade of demonstrating that. So we anticipate that we're going to continue to do that. And that's what our shareholders should be comfortable in. Danny, do you have some additional color for near-term? Thanks, Neal. Yes. And just again to -- Arun to reiterate my opening comment to the first question is that our commitment to our shareholders remain unchanged to be the low-cost leader in efficiency and in execution. And it's certainly been our track record, and that's what we anticipate going forward. But our commitment hasn't changed regardless of what CapEx does. Thank you, Arun. Sure. Good morning, David. Thank you. So let's move to the next question, please. Thanks, Kevin. Thank you, Derrick. Yes, Derrick, I think just to reiterate that point that I've made a couple of times now about Diamondback's commitment to our shareholders about maintaining the lead and efficiency and cost execution. It's exactly what Kaes just said. Yes, we've commented a couple of times about the increase in activity through 2022 was largely driven by independents and the challenge there is depth of inventory, right? And the secondary challenge is how much can increase further beyond their max cadence that they achieved last year. And I think both of those are playing out now. The max cadence may be softening, as you see by rigs getting laid down. And certainly, the inventory depth is getting accelerated with this rapid pace of bringing wells to production. So I think from an M&A perspective, it's going to be an interesting time over the next couple of years as these entities, the small ones, private, just try to figure out a way to monetize. And I think you've also got while their catalyst is unclear, you've also got some small cap public companies that are going to need to figure out some form of exit strategy to be -- continue to be relevant in the future. And then there's always the large private unicorns that's still flowing around out there as well, too. So I really think the next couple of years are going to be interesting in the M&A landscape. Well, Scott, when you do M&A, and if you do it correctly, you want to extend inventory life, you want to make sure that your free cash flow or cash flow accretive and you don't want to impact your balance sheet. So just doing PDP type acquisitions doesn't necessarily fit into that calculus, but it's -- I think that's what you're going to end up seeing with some of these exit strategies or just kind of straight PDP divestitures. Thank you, Scott. Hi, Jeff. Jeff, in addition to that, we talked earlier about purchasing steel multiple quarters in advance. So we are seeing the steel that we are purchasing for our 3Q, 4Q, 1Q costs already coming down. And so while it's not necessarily a service cost deflation, it is a cost deflation that could be as much as $20 or $25 a foot additionally. Thanks, Jeff. Hey, John. John, listen, just to reemphasize, we run the business to maximize efficiency as well. And so Kaes made the point that whether it's on the rig side or the completion side, we are about efficiency because we think that that's the greatest driver of shareholder value in a business where you don't control the price of the product that you produce. Thanks, Tim. Good morning, Charles. No, we didn't put this letter in place trying to fix the communication issue. We've got an incredible transparency communication format that we have with our shareholders. We just thought that based on a decade of doing these earnings calls and the lack of attention really paid in the prepared remarks, felt like we could remove that. And we also know that other industries are well ahead of the oil and gas sector by not doing prepared remarks. The other thing is that we could communicate more in this shareholder letter than what we traditionally would put in a truncated CEO quote in the earnings release. And then we didn't have to have anybody spending Sunday night preparing our transcript either as well, too. So I mean, from a staff perspective, there's a lot more efficient there. So no, we did this because we think it's a better way to communicate, not that we need to improve the message or the understanding in our stock price. And Charles, we've tried to be mindful of sins of the past, our industry has been known for, which is oil price goes high, free cash flow goes up and share repurchases are done not counter cyclically like we are trying to do so, but in cycle with higher oil prices and that hasn't created a lot of value. So we may not always be perfect in the calculus, but as Kaes pointed out, whether it's the banking crisis here recently or other forms of volatility, we've had an opportunity to purchase $2 billion worth of shares back at roughly $120 a share. So we feel like we are following through on our commitment of not only being flexible in our return program, but also being mindful of the method and the timing at which you repurchase shares. Thanks, Charles. Good morning, Roger. Danny, the difference between zipper and simulfrac in terms of footage per day yield. Good morning, Paul. Thank you for joining us this morning. I think another benefit of this new format is to allow more questions based on the amount of questions we had this morning. So, if you have any additional follow-up that you need, just reach out to us using the numbers that we provided earlier. Thanks again for joining. Have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Julia. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback's third quarter 2024 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning. I hope you've had a chance to review both the shareholder letter that went out last night as well as the investor day. We'll be covering a lot of that material in today's question session. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann: Morning guys. Nice update last night, Travis. Guys, I'll save all my AI and data center questions this morning for your year-end call and I'll jump into my first question this morning on capital efficiency which again, I think by my calculation you all continue to have better than any other E&P. And so specifically, could you all for your Travis, maybe speak to what you all believe could be your realistic free cash flow per barrel next year or actually looking at, just looking at what your breakeven would be assuming cost operations and well results continue to trend as they've been year-to-date.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neal, we've really focused on free cash flow generation over, CapEx spend in recent years and I expect that trend to continue. I think, with the Endeavor assets under the under the hood, that only improves our free cash flow margin, our reinvestment rate goes lower. Our corporate breakeven, we highlighted went down by two or three dollars a barrel. And I think in a world of a tenuous macro, the lowest break even and the longest duration of inventory is going to pay dividends. There's two things we really look at free cash flow margin, which is the output of the reinvestment rate but also how much CapEx are we spending per barrel of oil produced? And we like to say that we have the highest amount of barrels produced per dollar of CapEx in the business and you expect that trend to continue. So a lot of times a lot of work has been done here integrating two companies very, very quickly. I'm ecstatic about the progress that's been made. We've already learned some things from the Endeavor side and vice versa. And I think that's all going to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders through more free cash flow over a longer period of time.\nNeal Dingmann: Are you willing to put a number on where you see breakeven going at some point next year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I mean I think we laid it out on slide 9. The post dividend breakeven has gone from $40 a barrel to $37 a barrel by our map. I think we've always tried to say that we'd like our base dividend to break even at $40 a barrel. So either our breakeven has gone down or we have more implied capacity to look at the base dividend, which we expect to do early in 2025 outstanding.\nNeal Dingmann: Then my second question on the TRP asset trade, specifically how you all thought about valuation on each side. I'm just wondering on the Delaware PDP side, was that based largely just on reserve value of the assets and then looking at the Midland side. Is that based on a per location or maybe tell me what else I'm missing when you're all thinking about that swap.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. So I'll give you the high level. The operated acreage in the Permian is very, very valuable. And since we did the Endeavour deal, we've been pretty vocal that we're not a seller of the Delaware Basin. I think this trade was pretty unique in that TRP gets to move into the Delaware Basin and test some things in secondary zones. But Diamondback gets 18 DUCs in the Midland Basin, a little more current production, and 55 locations that compete for capital right away. So we're basically moving third and fourth quartile inventory into first and second quartile inventory, all while getting the benefit of capital efficiency from 18 DUCs added to the program and assets in our backyard. So we're looking at other options for other assets like this TRP trade. TRP was the first to move here and we were excited to get a trade done with them because those are pretty hard to do.\nNeal Dingmann: No. Great. Nice deal.\nKaes Van't Hof: From a valuation perspective, I'd say the high level PDP values were pretty similar. I would say we have a lower decline rate that we're selling. We're getting more current production at a higher decline rate, but we're also paying for DUCs, and these 55 top quartile locations, which are worth a lot these days in the Midland Basin.\nNeal Dingmann: Great details. Thanks, Kaes.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Neal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. The line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, team. Travis, you have -- from a Diamondback perspective, it feels like the company has your hands in terms of several cookie jars. In terms of your equity investments, I was wondering if you could help us frame kind of the value creation potential or embedded maybe asset value that we may not be giving you credit for as we think about investments in the epic crude line Deep Blue, and obviously maybe I don't know if I like Neal, I can wait until you're in. I wanted to get your thoughts on this data center kind of opportunity with the surface acres because investors have noted how one of a company who's developing a data center, Reeves county, has a pretty punchy evaluation in the equity market.\nTravis Stice: Sure, lots of questions there, Arun, but thanks for your time this morning. Listen on, on this whole data center deal, we've been listening to our shareholders to try to figure out a way to respond to their questions about can we create more value from our gas stream. And when you look at what we have as a total company, we've got abundant natural gas, we've got abundant surface acreage, over 65,000 acres on a pro forma basis, and there's a need for greater electricity. So rather than continuing to, get low margins on our gas and full boat on electricity, we're trying to figure out a way to be creative. Creative on ways to turn some of that natural gas into more value for our shareholders. The EPIC pipeline was a move that allowed us to increase our ownership almost to a full third, trying to recognize that there's ultimately going to be a need out of the Permian Basin for increased crude capacity. And so, while it's probably not a long-term investment, we think like a lot of our other equity investment methods, we'll be able to turn that into a very nice, very nice return for our shareholders. And in Deep Blue, we just continued to evaluate, the sustainability of the efficiency of that business model and recognize that there's some Endeavor assets that could potentially fit into that as well as we continue to unpack value creation from the pro forma companies.\nArun Jayaram: Great. My follow up is I just wanted to maybe understand on the efficiency gain side of the equation, in your prepared remarks, you commented how you think you can kind of execute your 2025 program with 18 rigs versus maybe a previous expectation of 22 to 24, maybe four frac fleets versus five previously. Understanding you're probably seeing the same amount of footage, what type of dollar per foot or cost gains you get from just running less horsepower and rig and rig lines. Just trying to understand that dynamic.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I mean, we set out when we announced the Endeavor deal thinking that 2025 would need between 22 and 24 rigs. There's been a lot of efficiency on both sides throughout the year. And that 18 rig number is still going to accomplish the same amount of lateral footage as the higher rig count. I think from a rig perspective, it's all about controlling variable costs, right? We also put pipe in the ground. We also use the raw materials, the same raw materials throughout the basin. But Diamondback is able to do that a lot faster. And so, if a rig line is $70,000, $80,000 a day being able to execute with six less rigs, translates to less variable costs in the business. Similar story on the frac side. We think on the frac side, we kind of learned from the Endeavor side about the higher pump rate. We kind of increased our pump rate from 80 barrels a minute up to kind of 90 to 100. That allows us to one complete wells faster. There could be some benefits to the reservoir that we're studying very, very closely. But overall, that also reduces the variable costs needed to run frac crews, which are much more expensive than a rig on a day to day basis. So, I think there will be periods of time where we need to run five simul-frac crews next year. High level, we can see, we see the simul-frac crews completing a little over 100 wells per year per crew. And it's just amazing the efficiencies that both sides of the ledger have squeezed out of the business here in a year where, we keep saying, oh, they're close to the asymptotic curve of efficiency. Well, they blew that out of the water this year. So kudos to the teams and the basin experts executing on our business.\nTravis Stice: Arun, just to add to that. I think from a high level perspective, the message that we really tried to emphasize was that all of the things that Kaes just outlined really describe delivery of synergies not only ahead of time, which we had originally contemplated through the year of 2025, we effectively got all of the synergies delivered now in the fourth quarter of 2024. So it's faster and it's lower. We put a note in there that we're on middle of basin wells. We're now at $600 a foot, and I think these guys got some momentum behind them that we're going to continue to see an improvement in that number. So high level, really proud of the organizations that they've checked their egos and looked at the right way to do things from both perspectives. And what we're seeing early on is some significant synergy deliveries. And I just want to, I know you've already seen these, but I want you to just mention it that we've put our, like we've done in the past, we've put our Synergy scorecard in our investor deck with some details behind it. So if you'll just look at slides 6 and 7, you'll see a lot of the details that Kaes was just highlighting and then also some of the high level comments that I made.\nArun Jayaram: Thanks, Travis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. The line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Thanks guys. Travis, in case I just wanted to ask, just in the context of some of the Synergy scorecard being achieved perhaps a little bit earlier than anticipated and obviously announcing some of the incremental savings, you guys are sort of still kind of standing by that 4.1 to 4.4 budget for next year to kind of keep this 475,000 barrels a day flat. Are we at the point now, I guess what sort of activity does that envision? And just given some of the incremental cost savings that we're seeing, are we trending now to be all the way at the lower end or is there kind of a cushion built in there for some flexibility going into 2026?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, good question, David. We always like a little flexibility. I think given the macro environment, as Travis said in his letter, there's some things we're thinking about for next year. Again, always thinking about free cash flow, generation, overspending, CapEx dollars, but I think we're certainly near the lower end of that original range, 4.1 to 4.4 to get to 480,000 barrels of oil a day next year. That includes the 5,000 barrels a day that Viper guided to in our Tumbleweed acquisition. I think generally if you see, well costs down $25 a lateral foot, we're completing about 5 million lateral feet a year. That's $125 million. So that's certainly going to be taken out of the budget. I do think there's still some of the ancillary spend items that we're refining, combined infrastructure budget, midstream budget, environmental budget, but in general, certainly moving towards the lower end of that range, we guided Q4 to 950 million to 10.50 million of CapEx. I wouldn't want to multiply the lower end of that number by four to get to your 2025 budget. But I'd certainly look at the midpoint or the high end to guide you to next year because I think, a lot of things are heading the right direction. Not only well cost, but well performance. Things like the TRP trade, all that's going to accrue to the benefit of the CapEx budget next year.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate all that color. It makes sense. Perhaps you can get just add a little bit of color just on some of the. I know some others talked about some of the other assets midstream you guys have highlighted obviously the royalty drop down. It seems like in the deck there's some expectation that some monetization is coming in 2025. Can you kind of give a little bit of color on where those processes stand now and when you'd be expecting to see some inflows from there?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. So, the big item is the drop down of mineral interest to Viper. That's actively ongoing. We've been pretty vocal that early 2025 is our goal there. I don't see anything that's taking us off that track. Second is the midstream discussion with our partners at Deep Blue. I think that's a little less important than the Viper drop down at the moment. And then, it's been interesting closing this deal. Mr. Stevens was notorious for having a lot, owning a lot of assets throughout the, throughout the country. We got some small assets in the Bakken, we got a small piece of some offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. So, we're excited to continue to monetize some of those. Some of the smaller assets. I don't think they're going to make a huge dent in the cash number, but they're all little things that you'd expect us to monetize at the right time. I think the other big item is about 15,000 acres in the Delaware basin of both operated and non-operated positions. So we're going to look at that, try to trade and block up where we can. But we're not in the non-op business given our cost structure and we'd likely monetize that into a very healthy market at some point.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Thank you guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. Your 2025 base plan is clear and you mentioned the ability to refine that plan based on the macro environment. Can you talk about how viable that plan is before dis efficiency kick in?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Bob, I think we got a lot of flexibility. I don't think it's the tool, it's the [Indiscernible]. Right. So we can dial things up and back very, very, very easily. I think just generally, if other companies are seeing what we're seeing, this is not a strong macro environment. So I don't know why the discussion of growth or multiyear growth needs to be in the equation. I think Diamondback has learned that our growth profile impacts the macro. And we're very focused on the macro here where almost universally the street is calling for oversupply in 2025. So I think we're building in flexibility to spend less should that come to fruition. But it's not hard to grow volumes in the Permian basin with the assets that we have. So I think what you would expect is, what looks easy on the outside is hard on the inside, but we make it happen.\nBob Brackett: But can it be gradual? Can it be like deferring some wells or does it have to be dropping a rig line or dropping a frac spread? What's the. Can you tweak things around the edge, I guess?\nKaes Van't Hof: Oh yes. I mean, we already do that, Bob. We went into the year running 15 rigs. Endeavour was running 10. Our team was -- 12. Our team was ahead of schedule. We dropped to 10 rigs mid-year because we had drilled more wells than we expected in the first six months of the year. So, dropping rigs, adding rigs, dropping a crew, swapping a crew, that's just what you expect us to do.\nDanny Wesson: And Bob, this is Danny. Our supply chain setups such that we don't really have any, really firm obligations with any kind of significant terms. So we've got flexibility built into our supply chain so that we can pivot to any market conditions or signals that we need to. And it won't be on a week by week basis. But if we see certainly a longer term trend in the market, we'll pivot our activity levels to protect our free cash flow and focus on driving shareholder returns over any kind of growth or production output.\nBob Brackett: Very clear. Thanks.\nDanny Wesson: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. I just love your perspective on the macro. I think, Travis, in your letter and in these comments, you've kind of shared a more cautious view for 2025. Is that a demand driven via supply driven view? And then, you've taken a different tack than some of the majors and other independents. It takes a little bit more of a growth orientation into 2025 in the Permian. Why do you think your strategy is the right strategy?\nTravis Stice: Well, as Kaes outlined, our strategy really is for flexibility. And when you look at the macro right now, it's kind of hard to look at a world that has 4 million to 6 million barrels a day of surplus capacity on the sidelines and try to think we can grow effectively into that. We've learned as an industry and at Diamondback the hard way that, you really need to focus on shareholder returns and free cash flow generation in this industry. And there may be a call for growth at some point in the future and I expect our shareholders would look to us to respond to that call. But it's certainly nothing that we hear or see today. And as Danny alluded to, we've got the flexibility to go any direction we need to go. But with this macro, macro view, we're going to just stay conservative and let volume be the output of cash flow generation.\nKaes Van't Hof: Well, and most importantly, we're focused on per share cash flow and free cash flow. Right. So if the macro is tenuous in 2025, well, per share metrics are going to have to grow through a lower share count. And we've always been about per share metrics, both cash flow and free cash flow. We have a slide in our deck that shows that growth over time. So that's not going to stop. I just think being cognizant of your impact to the global market is important and it's a lesson that Diamondback learned through 2020 and we hope the industry also learns that lesson.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Thanks, Kaes. And thanks Travis. That's the follow up which is just around share buybacks. At different points in the cycle, you've elected towards the variable or dividend oriented strategy versus the buyback. But it's notable that you're really leaning back into the share repurchase program. So can you get to talk about that evolution? Maybe it's the reflection of your thoughts on valuation and maybe being countercyclical if you do think we're in a softer period in 2025, but just your thoughts on the best way to allocate capital and why you're leaning towards the buyback.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I think Travis would echo this comment, but capital allocation is our most important job and we've had a flexible capital allocation philosophy since we started this lower growth, high free cash flow generation business. We've always been able to flex between a buyback and a variable dividend. I would say post Endeavor, we certainly have a business that's worth more combined and diamondback standalone per share. And so that's increased kind of our tolerance for buying back shares at these levels. I mean, I think, should things get improved from here, we buy back less. Should things get significantly worse from here, we lean in and use more of our free cash flow to buy back shares. That's what you'd expect us to do. I think the only thing that's really, going to be steady is base dividend and base dividend growth. But you should expect us to maintain that flexibility between buyback and variable despite our larger size.\nTravis Stice: And I think, Neil, the countercyclicality of share repurchases has proven to be the right strategy in a commodity based business. Our industry over the last 10 years probably has many instances where oil price was high, free cash flow was high, and share repurchases were high. And then oil price cycles down and you end up either issuing shares at the bottom or other unanticipated results. So again, just like we were talking about on the flexibility of our return program, we try to learn from the past and not repeat any mistakes. And that's certainly foundational to our share repurchase program.\nNeil Mehta: Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBetty Jiang: Good morning. So I was wondering if you guys can talk a bit more about the opportunities with the surface acreage and the water being a provider water in the Permian. I mean, these are recurring revenue streams that's clearly getting a fairly high multiple in the market. So what does it take for you to capture these type of new revenue streams? And how meaningful could it be?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Betty, I think there's a lot of land out here in West Texas, a lot of surface. We have about 65,000 acres in our portfolio. We also control a lot of molecules. So I think the mandate, as Travis mentioned earlier from our investors, is to stop selling your gas for zero and pay in full boat for power. And so we're going to find ways to benefit Diamondback shareholders by finding a new local market for our gas, but also insulating part of our business from what we believe to be an increasing power price in Texas over the next 10 years. So if we can cut off that cycle and benefit Diamondback shareholders, we're going to do it. I think the message we kind of put out there is that West Texas, has a lot of land, a lot of surface. It has a lot of gas that's, being sold for less than it should. It's got a lot of water production with that oil production that we have in the basin. And I think that results in a very cheap way to develop power. And the data center operators have not been focused on the Permian yet. There's certainly some conversations that are happening, and we're kind of putting the flag out there that this is a very cheap way to execute their business model while benefiting Diamondback shareholders. So more to come on that we're getting started, but we put a little teaser in the presentation this quarter.\nBetty Jiang: Yes, no, I appreciate that. Maybe my follow up is just how you're thinking about funding these type of investments, whether it be a JV partner with an infrastructure provider, infrastructure sponsor, or -- yes, because the gas power plants are pretty capital intensive to build.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Listen, I think you'd expect us to do similar things to what we've done in the past. Right. Our first wave of equity method investments, which created a lot of value for our shareholders, was based on midstream and pipelines being out of the basin. And we think this can be a similar route. I think it's still early, but I think you'd expect us to lean on the experts as our partners. I think we provide a lot of expertise in how to navigate the basin and navigate the rock, and we'll let our partners on the power side handle their portion of the business.\nBetty Jiang: Makes sense. Thank you for that.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Betty.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\nKevin McCurdy: Hey, good morning. First, congratulations on closing the deal. I know you've been working on that for a long time.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Kevin.\nKevin McCurdy: In your shareholder letter, you highlight the two big operational changes of using clear Fluids and drilling and using simul-fracs for completions of oil wells. I wondered if you could expand on that a little bit. Were those Fang practices that you're bringing to Endeavor acreage and do you have a rough estimate of what percentage of your wells use those techniques in 2024?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Well, for the Diamondback side, all of the wells we drilled and completed in 2024 were using clear fluid. And as of the fourth quarter today, all the rigs that were running are using clear fluid drilling system. And yes, that's a definite and know bring over from the Diamondback side. Simul-frac all of the wells we completed on a standalone basis. Besides the occasional spot crew in 2024, we're using simul-frac. And as of today, on a pro forma company, we're using all simul-frac operations. Four rigs or four crews and three of those are electric.\nKevin McCurdy: Great. Thanks for the detail. That's all for me.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJohn Freeman: Good morning, guys.\nTravis Stice: Hey, John.\nJohn Freeman: The first question I had just when we sort of think about like long-term, about trying to improve the realized gas price in the Permian. I believe in the past we all have done acquisitions. A lot of those came with marketing contracts. You all kind of had to wait for those to roll off before you had control. I believe Endeavor didn't really have any kind of binding marketing contracts. If you sort of think about just the big benefit you're going to now get with just the dramatically bigger scale, maybe ability to kind of get space on future pipe, etcetera, maybe just how you can talk to abilities to kind of leverage that scale to improve pricing?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, good question, John. We do have certainly some flexibility, particularly on the residue gas, natural gas side as well as the crude side. You've seen us make some moves already on the crude side with a little bit of an increased commitment to the EPIC pipeline as well as, increased ownership. So, that fits with our prior strategy of driving value through midstream but protecting ourselves commercially. I think on the gas side we've got a good amount of space on a combination of Whistler and Matterhorns. We have about 250 million a day of space on those pipes. Those were decisions made a couple years ago. We expect to have a good amount of space, about 10% of the pipe on Blackcomb, which is the next pipe from the Whitewater crew that's coming out in a couple years. And that leaves some gas for other opportunities. Our friends at Energy Transfer who bought WTG, we're talking to them about some things about getting our gas out of the basin. And that, kind of leaves a little bit of gas for us to make some of these capital allocation decisions in the basin related to power, also related to our, Verde clean fuels investment. So we heard our investors loud and clear. It's time to stop selling gas at zero and diversify our risk. And that's what we're going to do, particularly as more and more gas gets produced in this basin.\nJohn Freeman: That's great. And then just my follow up question, in the prepared comments you'll talk about, point out sort of the opportunity to implement these kind of shared best practices, if you will, of the of the two companies and you're closely studying kind of various completion designs just in how does that kind of work in practice? Do you all just sort of start to, I guess quite frankly test these in the field or kind of what's the process for maybe implementing some of these changes to see if there is something that sort of has legs that you all could implement across the board?\nTravis Stice: Well, the first thing we did was we had over 650 office moves in the first six days post close onboarded 1,000 employees. And so we physically located a lot of the GGRE teams together. And then since the physical integration, we've started the team integration as well too, where teams are getting together, actually having conversations about, okay, here's what we were doing, here's what you were doing. Now let's try to figure out how we can put those things together in the best way to go forward. And I'm real proud of the organization that as I mentioned earlier, they've kind of just checked their egos at the door and we're really trying to learn, trying to learn the best from both sides. And obviously, some of the pace and requirements for a public company in the 90 day scorecards is a little different than working for a private company. But all things considered, I couldn't be more proud of the way the organization is responding to giving and receiving grace and trying to seek to understand as we put these synergies together and the synergies are going to be delivered as we put these teams together. And I think the scorecard that you've seen, we'll figure out a way to communicate some of these wins over time, but the big ones that we promised in February of this year, we've already delivered. And again, that's also a credit to the organization.\nJohn Freeman: Thanks, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Hey, thanks. Good morning. A lot of it's been hit, but I thought I'd come back on the productivity and efficiency side of things. Maybe just a quick look back for a look forward. But as you think about the improvements, both in terms of drilling speeds, drilling capabilities, lower drilling costs, and then a similar kind of approach on the frac side, how much of it do you think is, call it mechanical changes, meaning going to electric fracs or the higher spec drilling rigs relative to experience and learning curves, the crews themselves. The reason I'm asking is trying to think about if it's mostly mechanical that kind of runs its course, but if it's a combination of factors, then that would indicate we do have further to go in terms of more cost reductions.\nKaes Van't Hof: I think it's a combination, but it's also a mentality that when we see something mechanical that works, it gets implemented right away across the whole portfolio. It's not, hey, we think this works, let's talk about it next fall. If this works, let's do it now. And that's happened on both sides. On the Diamondback side, clearly on the simul-frac plus drilling fluids. And on the Endeavor side, some of their post completion work was really intriguing to us and we've put that into effect right away. So I would say also the consistency of the business model, not having to change the plan for every $10 move in oil price has allowed for large scale consistent development. With a lot of crews having worked for us for three or four years now on the Halliburton side and on the rig side, we have some preferred vendors that have worked with us for a long time. So I think there's certainly more to come. We're not going to give any of these efficiencies back and I think, on top of that, the completion design work that's going on between the two teams is what is probably most exciting to me personally eight weeks in on what can be done to improve well results going forward.\nRoger Read: That makes sense. And this probably comes back a little bit towards Bob's question earlier about what you would do if oil prices were to fall. We were to get an oversupply in 2025. When you think about the productivity and efficiency, it's clear know as we've heard from you and other companies, right. A consistent plan that, allows you to drill and complete wells and minimize, your non-productive time and all that. So as you think about making tweaks along the edge, giving up those productivity and efficiency trends could be, counterproductive to actually saving money in the very near term. What's the right way for us to think about how you'll weigh those decisions if they do, market does force that upon you next year.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Roger, I think it goes back to what Travis said about lessons learned. Right. And I think we have the size, scale and balance sheet to be able to withstand a cycle should it happen. I think the only thing that we would probably change is that at the low point of the cycle, you're going to be putting pipe in the ground cheaper than any point across that entire cycle. So I think we'd probably prefer to build more ducts than maybe in the past and have the balance sheet capacity to do so. But I think that would be the big change. The efficiencies on the frac side, we've proven we can stand up. We stood up two simul-frac crews just this quarter and they're running at KPIs that are similar to the rest of our crews within a pad. So I don't really buy into the losing efficiencies argument when you, when we're based in Midland, we know this basin as well as anybody and we've done this before.\nTravis Stice: Yes, Roger, that's, that's a cultural element that you'll see throughout Diamondback and that what I'm speaking to specifically is we don't ever seed ground once we've taken it. And that's not a function of the service companies. That's not their responsibility, our business partners on that side, it's our responsibilities as you know, supervising and leading those functions to bring back to the table the ground that we had taken so that it isn't lost. And that's a very, very important cultural element to maintaining our best in class execution and low cost operations. And I hope that makes sense, Roger.\nRoger Read: It does. I appreciate the clarity. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nTravis Stice: Good morning.\nPaul Cheng: [Indiscernible] and the team. When you put the two companies together initially you're coming up with a synergy target but that's basically saying that okay -- the D&C cost is higher than you so you can bring it down. But of course indeed also probably doing something better than you guys as you think that you not going to have the big ego. So over the past three months, can you identify a couple of the biggest maybe that what you found that they have done substantially better than you. And can you quantify that? What is the potential saving from those?\nTravis Stice: Yes, I'll let Kaes talk about the specific savings. But we're eight weeks into this and we had our operations review a couple of weeks ago and we're immediately seeing some of the benefits of the Endeavor experience on drill outs, particularly where they've got a better drill out. It costs a little bit more money, but it's done quicker. And then the other one is on completion design. Yes.\nKaes Van't Hof: Combined to combine look at completion designs. Right. So, we've looked across the fence line and what Endeavor was doing for the last five years and then vice versa. And think about it, now we get to answer the questions that could not be answered a couple years ago. Right. So if they're drilling better, in 2022, they were drilling better. Joe Mill Middle Spraberry wells in U.S. and we had a big study on, hey, what's Endeavor doing? And I'm sure, they did similar things looking it up. So again, it goes back to that comment that Travis put in his letter. You can't model those benefits in an Excel spreadsheet, but I can guarantee you that there will be long-term benefits to the amount of data that's being shared between the two companies. And that, is kind of the holy grail of better combined well results. So better combined well results with the lowest cost structure is going to be a pretty impressive combination over the coming years. I think the other thing that we looked at, we have a huge production base, almost 600,000 gross barrels of oil a day. I think there's a lot of work to be done between the two teams on efficiencies and economies of scale on the production operations department. More to come on that that's probably slower to develop than D&C, which is front and center. But there's a lot of things coming our way.\nTravis Stice: And Paul, if you step back from it, it's hard to imagine any company, any single company that has more basin expertise than the pro forma company in Diamondback and Endeavor. And that's what we're seeing is we're seeing these basin experts come together collaboratively and come up with a better, a better solution to the problems. And those better solutions are, always underpinned by execution and cost. And so as Kaes just alluded to, it may be hard to articulate today, but you're going to see it over time as we continue to, to pick up the quarters and dimes and nickels as we put these two companies together in the Basin experts are trying to solve the same problem.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. The second question is that on the payout in the third quarter you did 78% and of course you've been saying about 50% on the free cash flow. If we're looking out over the next couple quarters and if the share price stays relatively close to where we are, how you balance between your desire to quickly get down to 10 billion net debt and payout ratio?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Paul, good question. I think I'll pick the second part first. I think if we're at this, in this kind of stock price environment, you're probably sticking to 50% of free cash, getting returns. And then when you go back to the third quarter, we had a couple things that impacted free cash flow for the quarter. One, we only had Endeavor count for 20 days out of the quarter. So even though the effective date of the deal was January 1st, the public numbers only account for 20 days or 21 days of Endeavor. So really the combined free cash flow of the business was a lot higher than that. But second, the Stevens family decided to sell down some of their shares post close. And we been pretty vocal with our shareholders that those are opportunities for us to commit to a large buyback at one time. And that's what we did with 2 million shares repurchased at one time. So I think that's more the exception than the norm here in this price environment. But that's why we have a strong balance sheet to be flexible, to do things like that, to do things like the TRP trade and still be on our way to 10 billion in net debt very, very quickly.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Can I slick a quick follow up?\nKaes Van't Hof: Sure.\nPaul Cheng: Any idea what's their family intention about their share? They sold 14.4. Are they done or that you think they -- did they indicate that what's their intention?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I don't have an answer to that, Paul, but I do know that we have a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity to participate and support our public shareholders on a consistent basis. I think the only thing that we've said publicly about the Stevens family stockholders is that over time they'd like to get down to where they're voting rights equal their ownership, which is, 25% of the of the business from about, 35% today.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade: Good morning, Travis, Kaes and Danny. I just have one question and I don't think it's been covered. You've covered a lot in your Q&A here, but it's really on OpEx. And I noticed that you've moved down the midpoints of your unit guidance, I think it was $0.10 on LOE and $0.20 on GP&T. And I'm wondering if you could give some maybe kind of portion that up. How much of that is maybe the Diamondback legacy assets doing better? How much of it is actually the contribution from the Endeavor asset base? In that case, it would suggest that the Endeavor assets are lower cost than Legacy Diamondback. Or also maybe it's just early realization of OpEx synergies. And if you give us a sense for that? And then Travis, going back to a point you made in your shareholder letter, you guys are still really, I guess, really optimizing, really analyzing and optimizing for 2025. And if your cost basis has already gotten better for 4Q, what does that suggest for 2025 in your mind?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I'll take the OpEx question first. I think, some things have moved down as a result of combination. I think we're going to be pretty conservative on guiding OpEx, only having 20 days of a combined business. So we're going to do a lot of work refining that over the next three months. I'm confident that we'll find some things that combined will come down on the LOE side. I would say the big difference between Diamondback's cost structure and Endeavors on LOE is that Diamondback sold our water business. So we're paying a third party fee for water disposal and handling versus Endeavor, consolidating that internally. So that's a $0.50, $0.60 delta per BOE by our estimation. That's going to help us combine. On the G&A side, we have a lot more BOEs and not a lot more G&A. So I'd expect that to come down a little bit. But all these things I think we'll get to refine here with Q4 reporting as we see three months of the combined business. And on 2025, Charles, I think we kind of hammered that point that well costs today are at the low end of our prior range. In some cases we're even below that. So what we need to do is focus on a plan that maximizes free cash flow, produces a lot of oil and has a very, very low breakeven. So that work's ongoing. I think things like the TRP trade getting worked into the plan are going to be free cash flow accretive to our stockholders.\nCharles Meade: Thanks for that detail Kaes.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani: Hi, just wanted to ask a little bit more on 2025. I know it's not official guidance and still the outlook, but just kind of looking at where you are, for fourth quarter on production at 840 to 850 and you're basically saying we're reaffirming 800 to 825 for next year. Kind of feels like maybe that's a little conservative. I think maybe gas has been outperforming a bit here. And then also just on 2025, I think the pro forma plan has always been to be sort of flattish on oil per the macro. That kind of makes sense, but certainly sounds like you guys would be willing to kind of let that decline on your end. So just wanted to kind of verify that as if it is a bad macro. Do you see kind of a small decline and a pullback or would you be willing to have a more meaningful decline if oil prices are a disaster next year?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, listen, our base case is still hit 480,000 barrels of oil a day. We got it. Q4 to 470 to 475,000 barrels of oil a day. So base case still hits 480 next year for low fours of CapEx. I think the macro is going to dictate the decision closer to January on what ends up happening. But and your comment about the BOEs. Yes, you're probably right. We're very conservative on the BOE number. I think you can certainly assume closer to 840 to 850 BOEs versus that 800 to 825. At the end of the day, the oil drives the decision here. So we're very, very focused on oil guidance. But BOEs probably will end up being closer to 850 versus that 800, 825.\nLeo Mariani: Okay then just on the tax side, I wanted to see if there's any incremental cash tax benefit at all from Endeavor. I mean, your cash taxes came in, I think below what you guys guided to in 3Q. I know it was only 21 days or so of Endeavor, but do you expect any kind of incremental benefit at all there or is it going to be roughly kind of the same rate going forward?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I don't think it will be material. We'll still be in the kind of high teens, mid to high teens cash tax rate.\nLeo Mariani: Okay, thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Leo.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nScott Gruber: Yes, Good morning. I wanted to come back to being flexible with the 2025 plan. A lot of questions on the how, but I didn't hear about when unless I missed it. But just given your low breakeven, at what oil price do you think about shifting out of maintenance mode? When do you start turning the dial?\nKaes Van't Hof: Well, high level, we're really not in maintenance mode. We're at 470 to 475 oil today we got it at 480 next year. Well, that's 2% growth. It is something. That's kind of the first goalpost. I think the key point is not necessarily how or when. It's that Diamondback is cognizant of this new business model and cognizant of the macro. And if we're not, we're not doing our jobs. So I think being cautious when things are when oil is in the high 60s and you have pockets of geopolitical premium coming in and out is a prudent thing to do. So at the end of the day, the lowest cost operator should be producing the last barrel in the basin. But I think that spreadsheet math is what's gotten this industry in trouble in the past and feels like we're getting ourselves in trouble again. So I think, again, I can't hammer enough that free, free cash flow trumps CapEx at Diamondback these days.\nScott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate it. And then a quick one on just the trends you're seeing in the marketplace. It's really nice to see you guys in at $600 a foot. So quickly, -- and you mentioned some additional deal synergy case caps. But curious because we have a background here of deflation and service costs and tangible item costs. So just how much of that kind of background deflation is baked into that $600 number? Or could that number still continue to trend down above and beyond any additional efficiency and deal synergy caps just from deflation. If you mark-to-market your service contracts today kind of where do you think you could see that $600 number go?\nKaes Van't Hof: I mean we're pretty mark-to-market. That $600 is a real-time number. Certainly, there are wells that are below that number, but we're adding more Wolfcamp D to the plan. That's a more expensive well to drill. There's a couple of Barnett Woodford wells throughout the portfolio. I think in general, the core Wolfberry development is probably below that. Longer laterals also helped us. But that's a pretty real-time look. We don't -- as Danny mentioned earlier, we don't have a lot of long-term contracts. We recontract a lot. We get a lot of market intelligence on the service cost side. And I'd say above that, Scott, I don't see a rig count that's going up in the Permian over the next quarter or so. And so that should continue to delay prices, which should accrue to our shareholders' benefits.\nScott Gruber: Thank you. Good color Kaes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kalei Akamine of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKalei Akamine: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for getting me on. I want to take another shot at 2025 CapEx. First, on the $600 per foot, it's a solid update. And I think it shows the talent of your team to drive that low number even lower. But wondering if you can help ground us. So I'm looking for a couple of pieces. First, can you remind us what's in the original 2025 guide? And then talk about the non-B&C piece embedded in that guide. Do you see any one-off spending to bring the endeavor assets up to your standards? And then whatever that piece is, does that roll in 2026?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean listen, I'll answer it again. I think $625 was kind of our assumed well cost for 2025. Now we're at $600. There are some wells below that. So we'll see what happens over the next couple of months. I'm confident in this team's ability to drive out costs, but we also like to guide fairly conservatively 15 months ahead of 2025 full year. So we like to keep all flexibility on our side. I'd say on the non-DC&E CapEx, the Endeavor assets are as good as ours above ground. I think there's some things probably $50 million, $60 million of environmental CapEx we got to spend next year, which is kind of onetime in nature. I think the combined infrastructure budget will probably be a little higher in 2025 than it will in 2026. We like to think that the infrastructure budget eventually moves closer to 6%, 7% of total capital. And Endeavor has a midstream business that has some CapEx that should we sell the midstream assets to our JV, that CapEx would be removed. So some moving parts. I think high level, the key drivers are heading in the right direction. And I think the combined acreage position should result in lower spend above ground over time than 2025.\nKalei Akamine: Awesome. I appreciate the color. Second question is going to go to Deep Blue. Here, you're targeting maybe Endeavor drop in first half of 2025, it sounds like, in the first deal, you took back $500 million of cash, 30% equity. Kind of wondering about deal structure, what should we expect for the upcoming drop? Will it be all cash? Or do you take back even more equity. And then for the guys that don't follow that space, how does one think about the range of deal multiples and what are assets.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean it's a lot of we'll see. I think our preference is cash and more cash to accelerate deleveraging targets. But we recognize we have a partnership with Deep Blue and they should recognize the same that we are going to work on this business to grow value together. And that doesn't mean -- that means we're not -- we've never been in the business of levering up a sub in exchange for cash at the parent. And so we'll be flexible. I think we've been flexible to date and that business has created a good amount of value already in a year. So a lot of work to do. I'd say that's less of a near-term objective than the drop down. We have a lot of people working very hard on the mineral drop-down, which is a very significant deal for both Diamondback and Viper.\nKalei Akamine: And maybe just a third one, just on the royalties [Indiscernible]. It's a really big chunk when you think about the amount of EBITDA associated with that asset and 8 to 10x, you get to really big numbers real fast. Are you still thinking that could be one package? Or is there a scenario where you break it down into more bite-size pieces.\nKaes Van't Hof: I think our preference is to do most of it at once. I think Viper has a lot of strategic objectives that we'll talk about in about an hour on its call, but I think getting the drop down behind us and showing the size and scale of that business on a combined basis is going to be important to future opportunities at Viper. I think it's amazing Viper today has an interest in 11,000 horizontal wells across the basin. And that's an information advantage that I don't think can be replicated. So I think momentum is very strong at Viper. That's also good for Diamondback shareholders because our ownership value has gone up dramatically this year. But I think our preference get most, if not all, of it done, and be off to the races in 2025.\nKalei Akamine: Great. Thanks, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer question. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thanks again for everyone listening in today and for the good questions. If there's any follow-up questions that you have, just reach out with using the numbers provided. Thanks, and you all have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes, Neal, we've really focused on free cash flow generation over, CapEx spend in recent years and I expect that trend to continue. I think, with the Endeavor assets under the under the hood, that only improves our free cash flow margin, our reinvestment rate goes lower. Our corporate breakeven, we highlighted went down by two or three dollars a barrel. And I think in a world of a tenuous macro, the lowest break even and the longest duration of inventory is going to pay dividends. There's two things we really look at free cash flow margin, which is the output of the reinvestment rate but also how much CapEx are we spending per barrel of oil produced? And we like to say that we have the highest amount of barrels produced per dollar of CapEx in the business and you expect that trend to continue. So a lot of times a lot of work has been done here integrating two companies very, very quickly. I'm ecstatic about the progress that's been made. We've already learned some things from the Endeavor side and vice versa. And I think that's all going to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders through more free cash flow over a longer period of time. Yes, I mean I think we laid it out on slide 9. The post dividend breakeven has gone from $40 a barrel to $37 a barrel by our map. I think we've always tried to say that we'd like our base dividend to break even at $40 a barrel. So either our breakeven has gone down or we have more implied capacity to look at the base dividend, which we expect to do early in 2025 outstanding. Yes. So I'll give you the high level. The operated acreage in the Permian is very, very valuable. And since we did the Endeavour deal, we've been pretty vocal that we're not a seller of the Delaware Basin. I think this trade was pretty unique in that TRP gets to move into the Delaware Basin and test some things in secondary zones. But Diamondback gets 18 DUCs in the Midland Basin, a little more current production, and 55 locations that compete for capital right away. So we're basically moving third and fourth quartile inventory into first and second quartile inventory, all while getting the benefit of capital efficiency from 18 DUCs added to the program and assets in our backyard. So we're looking at other options for other assets like this TRP trade. TRP was the first to move here and we were excited to get a trade done with them because those are pretty hard to do. From a valuation perspective, I'd say the high level PDP values were pretty similar. I would say we have a lower decline rate that we're selling. We're getting more current production at a higher decline rate, but we're also paying for DUCs, and these 55 top quartile locations, which are worth a lot these days in the Midland Basin. Thanks, Neal. Yes, I mean, we set out when we announced the Endeavor deal thinking that 2025 would need between 22 and 24 rigs. There's been a lot of efficiency on both sides throughout the year. And that 18 rig number is still going to accomplish the same amount of lateral footage as the higher rig count. I think from a rig perspective, it's all about controlling variable costs, right? We also put pipe in the ground. We also use the raw materials, the same raw materials throughout the basin. But Diamondback is able to do that a lot faster. And so, if a rig line is $70,000, $80,000 a day being able to execute with six less rigs, translates to less variable costs in the business. Similar story on the frac side. We think on the frac side, we kind of learned from the Endeavor side about the higher pump rate. We kind of increased our pump rate from 80 barrels a minute up to kind of 90 to 100. That allows us to one complete wells faster. There could be some benefits to the reservoir that we're studying very, very closely. But overall, that also reduces the variable costs needed to run frac crews, which are much more expensive than a rig on a day to day basis. So, I think there will be periods of time where we need to run five simul-frac crews next year. High level, we can see, we see the simul-frac crews completing a little over 100 wells per year per crew. And it's just amazing the efficiencies that both sides of the ledger have squeezed out of the business here in a year where, we keep saying, oh, they're close to the asymptotic curve of efficiency. Well, they blew that out of the water this year. So kudos to the teams and the basin experts executing on our business. Yes, good question, David. We always like a little flexibility. I think given the macro environment, as Travis said in his letter, there's some things we're thinking about for next year. Again, always thinking about free cash flow, generation, overspending, CapEx dollars, but I think we're certainly near the lower end of that original range, 4.1 to 4.4 to get to 480,000 barrels of oil a day next year. That includes the 5,000 barrels a day that Viper guided to in our Tumbleweed acquisition. I think generally if you see, well costs down $25 a lateral foot, we're completing about 5 million lateral feet a year. That's $125 million. So that's certainly going to be taken out of the budget. I do think there's still some of the ancillary spend items that we're refining, combined infrastructure budget, midstream budget, environmental budget, but in general, certainly moving towards the lower end of that range, we guided Q4 to 950 million to 10.50 million of CapEx. I wouldn't want to multiply the lower end of that number by four to get to your 2025 budget. But I'd certainly look at the midpoint or the high end to guide you to next year because I think, a lot of things are heading the right direction. Not only well cost, but well performance. Things like the TRP trade, all that's going to accrue to the benefit of the CapEx budget next year. Yes. So, the big item is the drop down of mineral interest to Viper. That's actively ongoing. We've been pretty vocal that early 2025 is our goal there. I don't see anything that's taking us off that track. Second is the midstream discussion with our partners at Deep Blue. I think that's a little less important than the Viper drop down at the moment. And then, it's been interesting closing this deal. Mr. Stevens was notorious for having a lot, owning a lot of assets throughout the, throughout the country. We got some small assets in the Bakken, we got a small piece of some offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. So, we're excited to continue to monetize some of those. Some of the smaller assets. I don't think they're going to make a huge dent in the cash number, but they're all little things that you'd expect us to monetize at the right time. I think the other big item is about 15,000 acres in the Delaware basin of both operated and non-operated positions. So we're going to look at that, try to trade and block up where we can. But we're not in the non-op business given our cost structure and we'd likely monetize that into a very healthy market at some point. Thanks, David. Yes, Bob, I think we got a lot of flexibility. I don't think it's the tool, it's the [Indiscernible]. Right. So we can dial things up and back very, very, very easily. I think just generally, if other companies are seeing what we're seeing, this is not a strong macro environment. So I don't know why the discussion of growth or multiyear growth needs to be in the equation. I think Diamondback has learned that our growth profile impacts the macro. And we're very focused on the macro here where almost universally the street is calling for oversupply in 2025. So I think we're building in flexibility to spend less should that come to fruition. But it's not hard to grow volumes in the Permian basin with the assets that we have. So I think what you would expect is, what looks easy on the outside is hard on the inside, but we make it happen. Oh yes. I mean, we already do that, Bob. We went into the year running 15 rigs. Endeavour was running 10. Our team was -- 12. Our team was ahead of schedule. We dropped to 10 rigs mid-year because we had drilled more wells than we expected in the first six months of the year. So, dropping rigs, adding rigs, dropping a crew, swapping a crew, that's just what you expect us to do. Well, and most importantly, we're focused on per share cash flow and free cash flow. Right. So if the macro is tenuous in 2025, well, per share metrics are going to have to grow through a lower share count. And we've always been about per share metrics, both cash flow and free cash flow. We have a slide in our deck that shows that growth over time. So that's not going to stop. I just think being cognizant of your impact to the global market is important and it's a lesson that Diamondback learned through 2020 and we hope the industry also learns that lesson. Yes, I think Travis would echo this comment, but capital allocation is our most important job and we've had a flexible capital allocation philosophy since we started this lower growth, high free cash flow generation business. We've always been able to flex between a buyback and a variable dividend. I would say post Endeavor, we certainly have a business that's worth more combined and diamondback standalone per share. And so that's increased kind of our tolerance for buying back shares at these levels. I mean, I think, should things get improved from here, we buy back less. Should things get significantly worse from here, we lean in and use more of our free cash flow to buy back shares. That's what you'd expect us to do. I think the only thing that's really, going to be steady is base dividend and base dividend growth. But you should expect us to maintain that flexibility between buyback and variable despite our larger size. Yes, Betty, I think there's a lot of land out here in West Texas, a lot of surface. We have about 65,000 acres in our portfolio. We also control a lot of molecules. So I think the mandate, as Travis mentioned earlier from our investors, is to stop selling your gas for zero and pay in full boat for power. And so we're going to find ways to benefit Diamondback shareholders by finding a new local market for our gas, but also insulating part of our business from what we believe to be an increasing power price in Texas over the next 10 years. So if we can cut off that cycle and benefit Diamondback shareholders, we're going to do it. I think the message we kind of put out there is that West Texas, has a lot of land, a lot of surface. It has a lot of gas that's, being sold for less than it should. It's got a lot of water production with that oil production that we have in the basin. And I think that results in a very cheap way to develop power. And the data center operators have not been focused on the Permian yet. There's certainly some conversations that are happening, and we're kind of putting the flag out there that this is a very cheap way to execute their business model while benefiting Diamondback shareholders. So more to come on that we're getting started, but we put a little teaser in the presentation this quarter. Yes. Listen, I think you'd expect us to do similar things to what we've done in the past. Right. Our first wave of equity method investments, which created a lot of value for our shareholders, was based on midstream and pipelines being out of the basin. And we think this can be a similar route. I think it's still early, but I think you'd expect us to lean on the experts as our partners. I think we provide a lot of expertise in how to navigate the basin and navigate the rock, and we'll let our partners on the power side handle their portion of the business. Thanks, Betty. Thanks, Kevin. Yes, good question, John. We do have certainly some flexibility, particularly on the residue gas, natural gas side as well as the crude side. You've seen us make some moves already on the crude side with a little bit of an increased commitment to the EPIC pipeline as well as, increased ownership. So, that fits with our prior strategy of driving value through midstream but protecting ourselves commercially. I think on the gas side we've got a good amount of space on a combination of Whistler and Matterhorns. We have about 250 million a day of space on those pipes. Those were decisions made a couple years ago. We expect to have a good amount of space, about 10% of the pipe on Blackcomb, which is the next pipe from the Whitewater crew that's coming out in a couple years. And that leaves some gas for other opportunities. Our friends at Energy Transfer who bought WTG, we're talking to them about some things about getting our gas out of the basin. And that, kind of leaves a little bit of gas for us to make some of these capital allocation decisions in the basin related to power, also related to our, Verde clean fuels investment. So we heard our investors loud and clear. It's time to stop selling gas at zero and diversify our risk. And that's what we're going to do, particularly as more and more gas gets produced in this basin. I think it's a combination, but it's also a mentality that when we see something mechanical that works, it gets implemented right away across the whole portfolio. It's not, hey, we think this works, let's talk about it next fall. If this works, let's do it now. And that's happened on both sides. On the Diamondback side, clearly on the simul-frac plus drilling fluids. And on the Endeavor side, some of their post completion work was really intriguing to us and we've put that into effect right away. So I would say also the consistency of the business model, not having to change the plan for every $10 move in oil price has allowed for large scale consistent development. With a lot of crews having worked for us for three or four years now on the Halliburton side and on the rig side, we have some preferred vendors that have worked with us for a long time. So I think there's certainly more to come. We're not going to give any of these efficiencies back and I think, on top of that, the completion design work that's going on between the two teams is what is probably most exciting to me personally eight weeks in on what can be done to improve well results going forward. Yes, Roger, I think it goes back to what Travis said about lessons learned. Right. And I think we have the size, scale and balance sheet to be able to withstand a cycle should it happen. I think the only thing that we would probably change is that at the low point of the cycle, you're going to be putting pipe in the ground cheaper than any point across that entire cycle. So I think we'd probably prefer to build more ducts than maybe in the past and have the balance sheet capacity to do so. But I think that would be the big change. The efficiencies on the frac side, we've proven we can stand up. We stood up two simul-frac crews just this quarter and they're running at KPIs that are similar to the rest of our crews within a pad. So I don't really buy into the losing efficiencies argument when you, when we're based in Midland, we know this basin as well as anybody and we've done this before. Combined to combine look at completion designs. Right. So, we've looked across the fence line and what Endeavor was doing for the last five years and then vice versa. And think about it, now we get to answer the questions that could not be answered a couple years ago. Right. So if they're drilling better, in 2022, they were drilling better. Joe Mill Middle Spraberry wells in U.S. and we had a big study on, hey, what's Endeavor doing? And I'm sure, they did similar things looking it up. So again, it goes back to that comment that Travis put in his letter. You can't model those benefits in an Excel spreadsheet, but I can guarantee you that there will be long-term benefits to the amount of data that's being shared between the two companies. And that, is kind of the holy grail of better combined well results. So better combined well results with the lowest cost structure is going to be a pretty impressive combination over the coming years. I think the other thing that we looked at, we have a huge production base, almost 600,000 gross barrels of oil a day. I think there's a lot of work to be done between the two teams on efficiencies and economies of scale on the production operations department. More to come on that that's probably slower to develop than D&C, which is front and center. But there's a lot of things coming our way. Yes, Paul, good question. I think I'll pick the second part first. I think if we're at this, in this kind of stock price environment, you're probably sticking to 50% of free cash, getting returns. And then when you go back to the third quarter, we had a couple things that impacted free cash flow for the quarter. One, we only had Endeavor count for 20 days out of the quarter. So even though the effective date of the deal was January 1st, the public numbers only account for 20 days or 21 days of Endeavor. So really the combined free cash flow of the business was a lot higher than that. But second, the Stevens family decided to sell down some of their shares post close. And we been pretty vocal with our shareholders that those are opportunities for us to commit to a large buyback at one time. And that's what we did with 2 million shares repurchased at one time. So I think that's more the exception than the norm here in this price environment. But that's why we have a strong balance sheet to be flexible, to do things like that, to do things like the TRP trade and still be on our way to 10 billion in net debt very, very quickly. Sure. Yes. I don't have an answer to that, Paul, but I do know that we have a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity to participate and support our public shareholders on a consistent basis. I think the only thing that we've said publicly about the Stevens family stockholders is that over time they'd like to get down to where they're voting rights equal their ownership, which is, 25% of the of the business from about, 35% today. Yes, I'll take the OpEx question first. I think, some things have moved down as a result of combination. I think we're going to be pretty conservative on guiding OpEx, only having 20 days of a combined business. So we're going to do a lot of work refining that over the next three months. I'm confident that we'll find some things that combined will come down on the LOE side. I would say the big difference between Diamondback's cost structure and Endeavors on LOE is that Diamondback sold our water business. So we're paying a third party fee for water disposal and handling versus Endeavor, consolidating that internally. So that's a $0.50, $0.60 delta per BOE by our estimation. That's going to help us combine. On the G&A side, we have a lot more BOEs and not a lot more G&A. So I'd expect that to come down a little bit. But all these things I think we'll get to refine here with Q4 reporting as we see three months of the combined business. And on 2025, Charles, I think we kind of hammered that point that well costs today are at the low end of our prior range. In some cases we're even below that. So what we need to do is focus on a plan that maximizes free cash flow, produces a lot of oil and has a very, very low breakeven. So that work's ongoing. I think things like the TRP trade getting worked into the plan are going to be free cash flow accretive to our stockholders. Thanks, Charles. Yes, listen, our base case is still hit 480,000 barrels of oil a day. We got it. Q4 to 470 to 475,000 barrels of oil a day. So base case still hits 480 next year for low fours of CapEx. I think the macro is going to dictate the decision closer to January on what ends up happening. But and your comment about the BOEs. Yes, you're probably right. We're very conservative on the BOE number. I think you can certainly assume closer to 840 to 850 BOEs versus that 800 to 825. At the end of the day, the oil drives the decision here. So we're very, very focused on oil guidance. But BOEs probably will end up being closer to 850 versus that 800, 825. Yes, I don't think it will be material. We'll still be in the kind of high teens, mid to high teens cash tax rate. Thanks, Leo. Well, high level, we're really not in maintenance mode. We're at 470 to 475 oil today we got it at 480 next year. Well, that's 2% growth. It is something. That's kind of the first goalpost. I think the key point is not necessarily how or when. It's that Diamondback is cognizant of this new business model and cognizant of the macro. And if we're not, we're not doing our jobs. So I think being cautious when things are when oil is in the high 60s and you have pockets of geopolitical premium coming in and out is a prudent thing to do. So at the end of the day, the lowest cost operator should be producing the last barrel in the basin. But I think that spreadsheet math is what's gotten this industry in trouble in the past and feels like we're getting ourselves in trouble again. So I think, again, I can't hammer enough that free, free cash flow trumps CapEx at Diamondback these days. I mean we're pretty mark-to-market. That $600 is a real-time number. Certainly, there are wells that are below that number, but we're adding more Wolfcamp D to the plan. That's a more expensive well to drill. There's a couple of Barnett Woodford wells throughout the portfolio. I think in general, the core Wolfberry development is probably below that. Longer laterals also helped us. But that's a pretty real-time look. We don't -- as Danny mentioned earlier, we don't have a lot of long-term contracts. We recontract a lot. We get a lot of market intelligence on the service cost side. And I'd say above that, Scott, I don't see a rig count that's going up in the Permian over the next quarter or so. And so that should continue to delay prices, which should accrue to our shareholders' benefits. Yes. I mean listen, I'll answer it again. I think $625 was kind of our assumed well cost for 2025. Now we're at $600. There are some wells below that. So we'll see what happens over the next couple of months. I'm confident in this team's ability to drive out costs, but we also like to guide fairly conservatively 15 months ahead of 2025 full year. So we like to keep all flexibility on our side. I'd say on the non-DC&E CapEx, the Endeavor assets are as good as ours above ground. I think there's some things probably $50 million, $60 million of environmental CapEx we got to spend next year, which is kind of onetime in nature. I think the combined infrastructure budget will probably be a little higher in 2025 than it will in 2026. We like to think that the infrastructure budget eventually moves closer to 6%, 7% of total capital. And Endeavor has a midstream business that has some CapEx that should we sell the midstream assets to our JV, that CapEx would be removed. So some moving parts. I think high level, the key drivers are heading in the right direction. And I think the combined acreage position should result in lower spend above ground over time than 2025. Yes. I mean it's a lot of we'll see. I think our preference is cash and more cash to accelerate deleveraging targets. But we recognize we have a partnership with Deep Blue and they should recognize the same that we are going to work on this business to grow value together. And that doesn't mean -- that means we're not -- we've never been in the business of levering up a sub in exchange for cash at the parent. And so we'll be flexible. I think we've been flexible to date and that business has created a good amount of value already in a year. So a lot of work to do. I'd say that's less of a near-term objective than the drop down. We have a lot of people working very hard on the mineral drop-down, which is a very significant deal for both Diamondback and Viper. I think our preference is to do most of it at once. I think Viper has a lot of strategic objectives that we'll talk about in about an hour on its call, but I think getting the drop down behind us and showing the size and scale of that business on a combined basis is going to be important to future opportunities at Viper. I think it's amazing Viper today has an interest in 11,000 horizontal wells across the basin. And that's an information advantage that I don't think can be replicated. So I think momentum is very strong at Viper. That's also good for Diamondback shareholders because our ownership value has gone up dramatically this year. But I think our preference get most, if not all, of it done, and be off to the races in 2025. Thank you."

            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning. I hope you've had a chance to review both the shareholder letter that went out last night as well as the investor day. We'll be covering a lot of that material in today's question session. Operator, please open the line for questions. Sure, lots of questions there, Arun, but thanks for your time this morning. Listen on, on this whole data center deal, we've been listening to our shareholders to try to figure out a way to respond to their questions about can we create more value from our gas stream. And when you look at what we have as a total company, we've got abundant natural gas, we've got abundant surface acreage, over 65,000 acres on a pro forma basis, and there's a need for greater electricity. So rather than continuing to, get low margins on our gas and full boat on electricity, we're trying to figure out a way to be creative. Creative on ways to turn some of that natural gas into more value for our shareholders. The EPIC pipeline was a move that allowed us to increase our ownership almost to a full third, trying to recognize that there's ultimately going to be a need out of the Permian Basin for increased crude capacity. And so, while it's probably not a long-term investment, we think like a lot of our other equity investment methods, we'll be able to turn that into a very nice, very nice return for our shareholders. And in Deep Blue, we just continued to evaluate, the sustainability of the efficiency of that business model and recognize that there's some Endeavor assets that could potentially fit into that as well as we continue to unpack value creation from the pro forma companies. Arun, just to add to that. I think from a high level perspective, the message that we really tried to emphasize was that all of the things that Kaes just outlined really describe delivery of synergies not only ahead of time, which we had originally contemplated through the year of 2025, we effectively got all of the synergies delivered now in the fourth quarter of 2024. So it's faster and it's lower. We put a note in there that we're on middle of basin wells. We're now at $600 a foot, and I think these guys got some momentum behind them that we're going to continue to see an improvement in that number. So high level, really proud of the organizations that they've checked their egos and looked at the right way to do things from both perspectives. And what we're seeing early on is some significant synergy deliveries. And I just want to, I know you've already seen these, but I want you to just mention it that we've put our, like we've done in the past, we've put our Synergy scorecard in our investor deck with some details behind it. So if you'll just look at slides 6 and 7, you'll see a lot of the details that Kaes was just highlighting and then also some of the high level comments that I made. Well, as Kaes outlined, our strategy really is for flexibility. And when you look at the macro right now, it's kind of hard to look at a world that has 4 million to 6 million barrels a day of surplus capacity on the sidelines and try to think we can grow effectively into that. We've learned as an industry and at Diamondback the hard way that, you really need to focus on shareholder returns and free cash flow generation in this industry. And there may be a call for growth at some point in the future and I expect our shareholders would look to us to respond to that call. But it's certainly nothing that we hear or see today. And as Danny alluded to, we've got the flexibility to go any direction we need to go. But with this macro, macro view, we're going to just stay conservative and let volume be the output of cash flow generation. And I think, Neil, the countercyclicality of share repurchases has proven to be the right strategy in a commodity based business. Our industry over the last 10 years probably has many instances where oil price was high, free cash flow was high, and share repurchases were high. And then oil price cycles down and you end up either issuing shares at the bottom or other unanticipated results. So again, just like we were talking about on the flexibility of our return program, we try to learn from the past and not repeat any mistakes. And that's certainly foundational to our share repurchase program. Thanks, Neil. Yes. Well, for the Diamondback side, all of the wells we drilled and completed in 2024 were using clear fluid. And as of the fourth quarter today, all the rigs that were running are using clear fluid drilling system. And yes, that's a definite and know bring over from the Diamondback side. Simul-frac all of the wells we completed on a standalone basis. Besides the occasional spot crew in 2024, we're using simul-frac. And as of today, on a pro forma company, we're using all simul-frac operations. Four rigs or four crews and three of those are electric. Thanks, Kevin. Hey, John. Well, the first thing we did was we had over 650 office moves in the first six days post close onboarded 1,000 employees. And so we physically located a lot of the GGRE teams together. And then since the physical integration, we've started the team integration as well too, where teams are getting together, actually having conversations about, okay, here's what we were doing, here's what you were doing. Now let's try to figure out how we can put those things together in the best way to go forward. And I'm real proud of the organization that as I mentioned earlier, they've kind of just checked their egos at the door and we're really trying to learn, trying to learn the best from both sides. And obviously, some of the pace and requirements for a public company in the 90 day scorecards is a little different than working for a private company. But all things considered, I couldn't be more proud of the way the organization is responding to giving and receiving grace and trying to seek to understand as we put these synergies together and the synergies are going to be delivered as we put these teams together. And I think the scorecard that you've seen, we'll figure out a way to communicate some of these wins over time, but the big ones that we promised in February of this year, we've already delivered. And again, that's also a credit to the organization. Yes, Roger, that's, that's a cultural element that you'll see throughout Diamondback and that what I'm speaking to specifically is we don't ever seed ground once we've taken it. And that's not a function of the service companies. That's not their responsibility, our business partners on that side, it's our responsibilities as you know, supervising and leading those functions to bring back to the table the ground that we had taken so that it isn't lost. And that's a very, very important cultural element to maintaining our best in class execution and low cost operations. And I hope that makes sense, Roger. Good morning. Yes, I'll let Kaes talk about the specific savings. But we're eight weeks into this and we had our operations review a couple of weeks ago and we're immediately seeing some of the benefits of the Endeavor experience on drill outs, particularly where they've got a better drill out. It costs a little bit more money, but it's done quicker. And then the other one is on completion design. Yes. And Paul, if you step back from it, it's hard to imagine any company, any single company that has more basin expertise than the pro forma company in Diamondback and Endeavor. And that's what we're seeing is we're seeing these basin experts come together collaboratively and come up with a better, a better solution to the problems. And those better solutions are, always underpinned by execution and cost. And so as Kaes just alluded to, it may be hard to articulate today, but you're going to see it over time as we continue to, to pick up the quarters and dimes and nickels as we put these two companies together in the Basin experts are trying to solve the same problem. Thanks again for everyone listening in today and for the good questions. If there's any follow-up questions that you have, just reach out with using the numbers provided. Thanks, and you all have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Lawlis: Thank you, Steven. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter 2024 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice.\nTravis Stice: Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you continue to find the Stockholders Letter that we issued last night, an efficient way to communicate. We spent a lot of time putting that letter together, and there's a lot of material contained in the text. Operator, would you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is now open.\nNeal Dingmann: Good morning, Travis and nice results. Travis, my first question is on sort of the leading capital efficiencies you all continue to highlight. Specifically, you talked about the latest announcement and I think you guys talked about dropping to 10 from 12 rigs and I think what that's even versus 14 a few months ago. And I'm just wondering, are the drilling efficiencies so good that you're able to maintain the pace from nearly 30% rigs than just a few months ago? And just wondering how you anticipate or if you anticipate the same type of efficiency as once you take over the Endeavor assets?\nTravis Stice: Sure. Good question, Neal. The first half of the year was really typified by us doing more with less. And you gave some numbers there, but just to, just to repeat some of those in January of this year, we estimated that we could get 24 wells per rig per year and now we're up to 26 wells per year for the rest of the year. And you see a similar efficiency gain on the completions, where we previously signaled 80 completions per year per crew, and now we're up to over 100 completions per crew per year. Those are simul-frac crews. And look, as we look into the future, one of the things that I get excited about is that these efficiencies are things that we don't get back. And so as we incorporate after close the new assets from Endeavor, I fully anticipate our operations organization combined with Endeavor's operations organization will be able to continue these results. And what's significant about that is when we talked to the market on February 12 announcing this deal, one of the biggest, the biggest synergy that we talked about was being able to apply Diamondback's current D&C cost on a larger asset. And I'm pleased to say today we're significantly below where we were in February. So that just accrues the benefit to our shareholders and, and really supercharges the delivery of the synergies that we were talking about. So, yes Neal, I'm very confident that we'll be able to continue this leading edge capital efficiency on a larger asset base.\nNeal Dingmann: Great to hear. Then I want to ask just quickly, on shareholder return plans, maybe just on sort of broad strokes, specifically, how would your plan vary? I mean, obviously, oil prices are jumping around. It could be anywhere from $90 to $70 environment. I'm just wondering, given your market sort of leading costs that we see on Slide 9, I'm just wondering, depending on where oil prices go, is that just a matter of having more free cash for buybacks and variable dividends or would there be any other changes we see in a high oil price environment versus a lower price environment?\nTravis Stice: Yes Neal, I mean I think the key point here is we've always had a very flexible return of capital program. Since the very beginning, when we put this in place in 2021, we've said we'd like to be able to flex between buying back shares and paying a variable dividends and we take that capital allocation decision very, very seriously. So we're set up in a way where if you have periods of weakness like we've seen over the last week or two, that's when the buyback kicks in. And if it continues to be weak, we'll continue to buy back more shares. That's the benefit of having a low break even on your capital program, low break even on your base dividend, and continuing to generate free cash flow down to much lower numbers than peers or than what the market is used to. So I think we're excited. If things do stay weak, we'll flex that buyback and be aggressive there. And if things improve and we have a good quarter in the 80s or 90s on crude then and we'll pay a big variable dividend. But I think that flexibility has been very, very advantageous to our shareholders over the last three years.\nNeal Dingmann: How low has that breakeven gotten down to?\nTravis Stice: Listen, we were very focused on looking at our base dividend breakeven at $40 crude, so mid-cycle capital costs $40 crude, we could keep production flat. I don't think in a $40 crude scenario we would do that. I think kind of lessons learned from what we've seen through the cycles over the years is that it's okay to let production decline if we were in a very, very weak commodity price scenario. But in that scenario, we should be allocating 100% of our free cash flow or even more to buying back shares, because in that situation, your share price is going to be likely to be very weak. So we're really trying to move the capital allocation decision from the field and the assets to what do you do with your free cash flow and that's I think is a good place to be.\nNeal Dingmann: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning and congrats again on very strong execution here. You've talked about getting that net debt level lower post transaction case. Kaes and Travis, how do you see yourself doing that? Is it through asset sales or through organic free cash flow generation? Just your perspective on the asset sale market recognizing you did some small deals here in the quarter?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neil. I mean, I think when we announced the deal, we were very conscious of the cash stock mix that we put in place for the Endeavor merger. I don't think we put it -- we didn't put so much cash in the deal that we had to be a seller of assets. But what you've seen us do is, sell multiple things now over the last couple quarters that start that up. Right? We sold a little bit of our Viper ownership to take some risk off the table and get some cash in the door. We sold our interest in WTG West Texas Gas to Energy Transfer. That will get some cash in the door. And then little things like our little mono [ph] sale that we did last quarter, all that kind of almost adds up to $1 billion, which on top of free cash flow generation between January 1 and today is going to reduce the cash outflow burden for the Endeavor deal. I think we planned on looking at the deal as a delevering process through free cash flow, but the asset sales are a kicker that accelerates that. And I think we're highly focused on getting to $10 billion as quickly as possible. And then I think things can slow down from there. But I don't think you'll see us be a forced seller of assets post deal close. And I think we're going to be very, very stingy on keeping operated properties in the Permian because they're kind of worth their weight in gold right now.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Makes a ton of sense. And then just your perspective on managing gas price volatility, first of all, what are your latest thoughts on Matterhorn and when that comes in? And then secondly, how do you mitigate some of the risks around gas prices so you can really earn the margin that you deserve on the oil side of the equation?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, that's been a big topic lately and obviously we need to start making more money on our gas in the Permian and Diamondback specifically. If you look back to the history of Diamondback, we've grown through acquisition. A lot of the deals that we've done have come with marketing contracts where we don't control the molecule much further than the wellhead. And so what we've been doing over the last, I'll call it five years, is that as contracts roll off, we've been taking advantage of that and getting taken kind of rights on that molecule. We started with our commitment to Whistler and have grown that. That combined with Matterhorn will have a little bit of gas on both of those. And then I think you saw our press release last week that we're going to be a participant in the next pipeline from those guys, the Blackcomb Pipeline. And I just think that fits the strategy of let's take control of our molecules and see what we can do with them and I don't think that stops at pipeline commitments. We're really looking at power needs in the basin. Things like our Verde gas to gasoline plant and trying to find ways to create a local market here in the Permian, because it's a shame that we continue to sell gas near zero or below zero. So it's on us to continue to improve that portfolio and I think with size and scale and time we'll be able to do that.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Kaes.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. My first question is just on the efficiency gains you highlighted in the letter. It looks like you're pushing you're drilling cycle times to 26 wells per rig and on the completion side, pushing 100 wells per frac fleet, simulfrac fleet. I was wondering, Kaes and Travis, if you could describe what the drivers of that those efficiency gains are and perhaps help us think about what's underwritten in the pro forma $1 billion to $4.4 billion guide for Endeavor for calendar 2025?\nKaes Van't Hof: Sure. On the rig side, we specifically talked about bit and bottom hole assembly improvements and again, that's not necessarily the adoption of some new emerging technology. I think it's really another example of what our guys do really, really good, which is a laser-like focus on every decision that's made. They measure almost every attribute of drilling the well and they seek for improvement and they compete against one well versus the other and we pay bonuses to the crews out there when they execute in a stellar fashion. So it's not something, again, that's easily repeatable and it's not a shelf item that someone can go take, but it's a culture of execution that's always been part of this business. On the completion side, there's been some design changes where we've increased rate, but we've also continued to try to optimize the exact way that we mobilize equipment. We've done some changes on some pipe down hole that allows a greater rate with less friction loss. So, again, it's nothing that's a marquee item, but it's just intense focus on doing what it is that we do, which is really, really execute well when we convert rock into cash flow.\nDanny Wesson: Yes, listen Arun, I mean all these things certainly have accrued to us since we announced the Endeavor merger in February. I think, as Travis mentioned earlier on the call, these are permanent items that aren't going to go away from service cost inflation or deflation. So as we work through the pro forma model, we're probably thinking that we're going to run closer to 18 to 20 rigs next year, versus 22 to 24 a while back, and closer to four to five simul-frac crews versus five plus. So we're certainly modeling these things accruing for the good guys, and it only give us a head start on the promises we made on 2025 numbers.\nArun Jayaram: Great. My followup is just on the raised production guide. You raised your oil guide at the high end by close to 1.5%, just under that and then you took up CapEx. Kaes, one thing that wasn't quite intuitive is that you're completing 7% more feet on a net basis. And so one of the questions that's come in is, would have thought maybe the oil increase would have been a little bit higher based on that level of completed footage. But maybe you could help reconcile that for us this morning.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I mean, I don't think wells are completed like they look to be completed in the spreadsheet. Right? I mean, in 22 well pads, you move one pad from 2023 into 2024 and you got 22 extra wells. So we kind of moved almost, I think, 30 wells from 2023 into 2024. So our well count is a little bit higher than maybe a true level loaded run rate would be. But I think we're also just preparing room for a major acquisition to close. And I think we're doing everything we can on our side to be prepared to hit the ground running and hit numbers right away and do exactly what you would expect us to do. So I think more importantly, it's the more drilled lateral footage for less CapEx that gives us a lot of flexibility in the second half of the year and carry that momentum into 2025.\nArun Jayaram: Makes total sense. Thanks, Kaes and Travis.\nKaes Van't Hof: You bet. Thanks, Arun.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Arun.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDavid Deckelbaum: Hey, Travis, Kaes, Danny and team, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to followup on some of the earlier questions. You've obviously seen a lot of field efficiencies, particularly on the drilling side. You've lowered the Midland footage costs down, I guess 20 some dollars to midpoint. But I'm curious, like as you approach this 3Q to potentially 3Q or 4Q Endeavor closing, are there any parts of the efficiencies that you're seeing that you don't think that you could accomplish with as a synergy here? Because it would seem like that $300 million or so of synergies that you apportioned to just CapEx savings is increasing by the day.\nDanny Wesson: Well, that's why I highlighted, David, that where we are today is much better in performance and execution than where we were just in February when we talked to you about this deal. These are cultural elements, this attention to detail, this focus, this laser-like attention to execution. And we look forward to bringing on our new friends from Endeavor. And look, David, from what we hear from them anecdotally, they're seeing similar efficiency gains as well, too. So when we put the two cultures together, I expect it to be an add or not a detractor when we actually put the two companies together here before too much longer.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate that and then just a followup to that. You've also seen the benefits of longer lateral progression, I guess, relative to your original plan this year. I know one of the things you highlighted with the Endeavor deal was the potential increase of lateral lengths to 15,000 further [ph] and beyond given 100,000 plus number of acres, how do you see the progression, I guess, into next year and then 26 in terms of lateral lengths relative to where we're at today or is this something that's a longer term endeavor?\nTravis Stice: Well, first we're going to have to get the two assets put together, which we obviously can't do that currently. I'll let Kaes answer the synergy question specifically, but I wanted to highlight something that we talked about in our earnings release and our stockholder letter was that we drilled a 20,000 foot lateral well in under eight days, under nine days, seven, eight days. And longer is not going to be a problem. It's just we need to make sure we have the least geometry to be able to drill even longer wells.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I mean, I think, David, on the plan we can't put anything together until post close, but I think the priority for the teams right now is what does the plan look like end of 2024 and into 2025 post close and then what are the projects look like starting to back out to 2025 and into 2026, start to extend laterals. I mean, I think holding the level that we have this year, almost 12,000 feet on average for 300 wells is a pretty stellar number that we should probably look to maintain. I think going much further than that for a full program of 500 plus wells a year is going to be tough to do. But I don't think the guys are scared of drilling to 20,000 feet and if we have those opportunities, we'll take advantage of them.\nDavid Deckelbaum: I appreciate the color, guys.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJohn Freeman: Good morning, guys. First topic I just wanted to followup on is on the return of capital framework. When you look at Slide 6 and just sort of think about, again the efficiency gains that are really impressive, and is over time as that sort of drives that maintenance CapEx or reinvestment rate lower, should we think of maybe the first kind of evolution of that return of capital framework just being that creates like a bigger, I guess for lack of a better word, wedge that can go to that base dividend? Is that more likely kind of the way it would evolve as opposed to maybe increasing that 50% plus that's going to shareholders overall?\nTravis Stice: Yes John, I mean, I think those are two separate decisions, but I think you hit the nail on the head on as efficiencies accrue and our decline rate shallows over time and your balance sheet shrinks over time, that should create room there between your breakeven and your $40 dividend breakeven. So I think that's how we're still going to look at it. I think we see dollar $40 on the E&P side as a very well protected number. We're still going to buy puts at right now we're buying them at $55, $60 crude, but eventually probably reduce the value of our put buying down to closer to $50 just to protect the extreme downside scenario. And I think the rest of the free cash, we did move back from 75% of free cash going to equity down to $50. But that doesn't mean that number is not going to be higher in the future in times of stress. I think in times of stress or significant stress, the number should be a lot higher than 50% of free cash going to equity. And when things are going well, the numbers should be closer to 50, and we'll continue to build a fortress balance sheet. I've been very pleased with the response from our large shareholders on cutting back to 50% of free cash going to equity, because they want us to have a more fortress balance sheet than we even thought going into the deal. So I think that's been a pleasant relief and allows us to build a lot more cash and be ready for the inevitable down cycle in this sector.\nKaes Van't Hof: And John, I think a good way to demonstrate or a good way to visualize the Board's commitment to this sustainable and growing dividend is on Slide 7. Go all the way back to 2018, when we initiated the dividend and you can see on that slide the growth rate. And on the bottom half of that slide, you can see that our commitment has translated into almost $8 billion of capital returned to our shareholders. So it is a meaningful lever that we have as a company and the Board's commitment to continue the sustainable and growing dividend.\nJohn Freeman: That's great. And then just my followup when we take these efficiency gains that have allowed you all to basically pump the brakes on rigs and frac crews in the second half of the year without missing a beat on the original production plan, is there any environment where you all would choose to basically just sort of plow ahead at the run rate you all were on in the first half of the year and just sort of allow production growth to accelerate? Is there any sort of an environment where you would foresee that ever kind of occurring?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, just where we sit right now, John, that's not a logical scenario that we see playing out in the next six months, three, four quarters.\nTravis Stice: Yes, I mean, historically we've tried post-COVID favor free cash flow generation over growth, and I think you've seen that trend continue here with what we're doing in 2024.\nJohn Freeman: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nScott Hanold: Yes, thank you. There's been a lot of talk of good operational efficiencies. Could you maybe pivot in and talk about what you're seeing in terms of, well performance of productivity over the last year. Is it pretty much status quo on apples to apples basis or are you seeing some gains there as well?\nTravis Stice:\nMill. We're: So I think we've had a few really, really good years of well performance. We're always trying to keep pushing the performance side, but I think this year has been a year of cost gains versus well performance gains, but that doesn't mean there's not significant inventory expansion going on across our portfolio.\nEnergen: So I think we've had a few really, really good years of well performance. We're always trying to keep pushing the performance side, but I think this year has been a year of cost gains versus well performance gains, but that doesn't mean there's not significant inventory expansion going on across our portfolio.\nScott Hanold: Thanks for that. And then my follow up question is, you kind of highlighted obviously all the drilling efficiencies again and I think you made a comment that from what you understand, the Endeavor folks are seeing some similar stuff. But can you give us some context like based on what you can see from your understanding at this point? Where is Endeavor relative to where Diamondback is? So just trying to get a sense of should we expect once the merged company comes together, there's still some work to do to get it back, to get it all toward where Diamondback is right now, or is it going to be pretty much just hitting the ground running?\nTravis Stice: Well, it's going to be hard work for sure. It's our job to do that hard work and make it look easy for you guys. There's some decisions that we'll make pretty soon after we combine the two companies. One would be the use of clear drilling fluids and the second would be to put more of the frac operations onto simul-frac. So those are the two biggest levers that have the quickest change. But look, we're also going to, like we've always done, check our egos at the door and make sure we seek to understand what the Endeavor team is already doing. And historically that's generated better results when we seek first to understand and then pick the best path forward with the combined inputs from legacy Diamondback, and the new asset, new management from Endeavor. So we're going to make it look easy, but there's going to be, it's hard work behind the scenes, but I'm really confident that both of the two leadership teams are going to be able to pull this off and make it look good.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I mean, I think from a numbers perspective, the way we're thinking about it is the pro forma business will be running basically kind of 21, 22 rigs off the start, and then by 2025, we'll probably be averaging closer to 18 to 19 combined.\nScott Hanold: It's good color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.\nBob Brackett: Good morning. Following up on those intriguing operational efficiencies, you mentioned the average of 26 wells per rig year, 100 wells per crew. What's the pace setting, rig or crew look like? Is it significantly ahead of that or is there a big opportunity to grab?\nDanny Wesson: Hey Bob, it's Danny. Yes, I mean I think the crews and the rigs are pretty well all within a margin of error of each other in their performance. We've been really pretty active on fleet management over the past few years and continue to optimize our fleet where we see dwindling performance. And the best thing about our operation is the collaboration we have between the teams on sharing best practices on best-in-class rigs. So when we look at the rigs across the board there's always one pace setting rig, but that tends to move around as we share best practices and the other rigs catch up and then another one will pass that rig. So not one unique standout that's driving that number. It's pretty well across the board at that same level of efficiency.\nTravis Stice: We do have a pretty healthy competition between internally and then we also every quarter we look externally and there's a pretty healthy competition. And that's why in our Stockholders Letter, I talked about in this quarter in the Midland Basin the drilling team got over 20,000 feet with a single bit run and that represents a record in the Midland Basin. So I'm sure that record will fall, but it's just part of the culture of evaluate internally and externally and compete to win and that's what our organization does.\nBob Brackett: Yes, very clear. Quick follow up along that line. How do we think about the relative price between pulling on that ROP lever versus reducing nonproductive time or even reducing mob/de-mob time? Are they equal sized prices or is one the more obvious of the three?\nTravis Stice: I think it kind of moves but you're getting to the point in time where, there's the little things we're focusing on now or the efficiency drivers. We talked in the last call about the guys focusing on pipe makeup speeds because that was where they saw the most NPT [ph] time on a well was just how long it takes them to break and make a pipe. And we're constantly looking at where that dead space is in these jobs and trying to attack it. And we don't just attack one dead space, we attack them all at the same time. And I think, you know, NPT [ph] time has been a focus of coming out of the really aggressive activity levels we saw in 2023. And we've really done a good job of reducing NPT time, but there are certainly always things we can focus on there to continue to drive uptime and drive constant performance and not waiting on the sidelines for something to be fixed.\nKaes Van't Hof: And when we look at those details, we do it every quarter for sure. And what Danny is talking about requires a great deal of collaboration across all the teams. And even though I emphasize the competition aspect of what it is that we do, the collaborative aspect is really where this sits home, because when one team finds a solution, it's quickly shared with all the other teams internally. And in a similar fashion, if we find something externally, we would quickly adopt that as well, too.\nBob Brackett: Very clear, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thank you, good morning.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: Congrats on another solid quarter, guys. Just a couple of questions kind of operating focused here. One, if we look at the production beat here in the second quarter, you got it on NGL and gas. We were just sort of curious. We kind of figured maybe you stripped more liquids out of the gas, but then you would have lower gas production. So maybe a little bit of insights into kind of what's lifting the NGL side and keeping the gas production up?\nTravis Stice: Yes, I think on the NGL side, trying to put as much ethane as you can in the NGLs to get them out of the basin, we even probably throughout the second quarter, we saw obviously a lot of gas price weakness. So we did take a couple of our highest GOR wells down for a month or two to ease that pressure. So I think even in the face of that, the gas curve continues to outperform expectations. But we kind of even curtailed a little bit of oil to make sure our gas production was a little bit lower in the quarter, which we kind of have continued in the third. So we just have a lot of gas production out of this basin, and that's kind of why we have such a focus now on trying to generate more value for the gas that we're producing, whether that be in basin or out of basin.\nDanny Wesson: Yes. And just to add to that, the focus on around environmental performance has driven a lot of decisions to not burn gas in the field for energy consumption and instead convert that energy demand to electrical demand. And so you're seeing a lot of gas that would have otherwise been burnt in the field to run our operation being put down the pipeline. And then on top of that, the focus on reducing, flaring those are all things that send gas to sales and get reported as a production number. That's driving some of that increase you're seeing across the basin.\nRoger Read: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just coming back to the drilling efficiencies and the completion efficiencies going from 24 to 26 wells on our completions, can you give us an idea of maybe where the upper 10% or upper quartile is? In other words, I'm trying to think of if 24 went to 26 is the best 30, and that's where you can ultimately go or it's a much tighter dispersion so it's 26 the average best 28, maybe worse, is 24. I'm just trying to get a feel for the further improvements kind of the same idea on the completion side.\nDanny Wesson: I think, it's a good question. It just depends. But we certainly have some rigs that are drilling at a pace of 30 plus wells a year. Just depends on which zones and lateral links and all that kind of stuff. But we're really focusing on pad cycle times and how to reduce the full pad cycle time. These are large pads and give driving flexibility in the plan by reducing that cycle time on the pads is really what's important to us. And so if we have one rig that's outperforming the others in one zone, we want to look at that zone, what that rig is doing and kind of share it with the other rigs so that we can accrue that benefit to all the pad development across our portfolio.\nRoger Read: Got you. And maybe if I could just clarify on that. Three mile laterals versus something less than that as a percentage of total.\nDanny Wesson: I'm sorry, just to rephrase your question, are you asking what's their percentage of three mile laterals to?\nRoger Read: Yes, you said, it depends on what you're drilling and which zones. I was just curious, is there, obviously, it would take not as long to drill a lesser length lateral, but I was just \u2013 is there a percentage that you offer of the much longer lateral wells?\nDanny Wesson: I think our 15,000 footers this year were like at 25%-ish of our development.\nTravis Stice: Yes, listen, the rig per year number is an output of getting 300 wells per year drilled. Right? It's really about net lateral footage or gross lateral footage drilled per year per rig. I think Danny is talking about 30 wells per rig. Well, I think if we're drilling more Wolfcamp D with a particular rig, that rig is going to be a little slower. But I think the general standard Wolfberry development is pushing that upper, upper echelon, but we really see the rig count as the output of what we need to do from a drilling perspective on hitting production guidance.\nRoger Read: All right, thanks for indulging me the extra question, guys.\nTravis Stice: No problem.\nDanny Wesson: Thanks, Roger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Jay of Daniel Energy Partners. Your line is now open.\nGeoff Jay: Hey, guys, just one quick one from me. I'm just kind of curious how you think about the potential for trimul-frac in your portfolio, kind of especially after Endeavor closes.\nTravis Stice: Yes, I mean, we've looked a lot at trimul-frac, and the struggle for us is the infrastructure spend we'd have to implement to get to trimul-frac across our portfolio. And does that additional infrastructure spend, do we recognize the return on that from the efficiency gains from moving from simul-frac to trimul-frac? We think the cost benefit somewhere in the move from simul-frac to trimul-frac, certainly something we would pursue in areas where we have the infrastructure in place to do so. And if we have available enough development in that area, in those areas to dedicate a trimul-frac crew, you would see us move that direction very quickly.\nGeoff Jay: Excellent, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open.\nCharles Meade: Good morning. Travis, Kaes and the rest of the Diamondback team there.\nTravis Stice: Hi, Charles.\nCharles Meade: Travis, yes thank you. I want to -- I think you really tantalized a lot of people with that metric. I really appreciated it, that 24 wells a year, 26 wells a year. But I thought Kaes' comment was really, really interesting in that I've been focused on that. I think other callers have been, but really, that's the output rather than the. It's kind of a manifestation or an indicator rather than a driver, if I understand case correctly and so if that's the right way of looking at it. When I look at the other pieces of your guidance, you've actually increased the lateral length a little bit, and you've increased the well count a little bit. And so is the delta on the drilling side actually a little bit bigger the delta, the improvement you've seen since your initial plan than that 24 over or 26 over 24 would indicate?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean, I think so, Charles. I think the point I was trying to make is that as a public company that has public guidance and quarterly guidance, we really work from guidance backwards, and we make what looks like an easy output on the surface is very difficult below the surface. There's a lot going on in terms of the teams being able to move things around and add rigs here and drop rigs there and the plan isn't always the plan. We got to be nimble and work together as a group. And I think that harmony we have across all of our functions is what makes us pretty unique, particularly also given that we're in one basin. So I would say the drilling improvements this year have been more surprising than the completion improvements because we always kind of thought that drilling was already near the asymptotic curve of what they've been able to do. Not to knock the frac guys, but the drilling improvements probably supersede the frac improvements here today.\nCharles Meade: Thank you for those comments. Kaes, go ahead. That's all from me.\nKaes Van't Hof: That's a little test for the FRAC guys to step it up next quarter.\nCharles Meade: Yes. Glad to put the ball in the tee for you there. Have a great day.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Charles.\nTravis Stice: Thanks, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Cheng: Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nTravis Stice: Good morning, Paul.\nKaes Van't Hof: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Cheng: Travis and Kaes, that we appreciate that about great improvement in your result. But just curious that, I mean, over the next two or three years, if we're looking at the productivity improvement in drilling and completion, is that one or two areas you see as the biggest potential for you and will you be able to also quantify on that? And the second question is that if we look at oil pro forma over the next couple of years, I mean, in order to maintain a flat production post-Endeavor, I mean, how many wells that we need, is it 500, 520, 550 any kind of rough idea? And also that do you have what Endeavor gas pricing right now, are they all in the Waha basin or that they're also spread? Thank you.\nTravis Stice: Well, I'll talk specifically about your look ahead for two to three years and I think if you put it in one bucket, it would be in the down-hole sensing technology that allows the bit to stay in the best rock, the highest percentage of time. And then on the completion side, understanding using downhill sensing, where you can place the most frac energy in the most efficient way that creates the greatest stimulated rock volume. And these sensing technologies are evolving very, very rapidly. I think before too long we'll be able to actually sense in front of the drill bit and drill towards a target rather than drilling past it and making adjustments. And that sounds like a small change, but I think the sensing technology that we're right on the cusp of having some of those problems solved is going to be a real game changer for our industry.\nKaes Van't Hof: Paul, on your well count question, I think kind of low 500 is a good place to start and as low 500 dwells per year, but as you know, the land efficiencies accrue to us and laterals extend and the decline rate shallows a bit, you probably start to get below that 500 number should production stay flat. Now, if things are a market that's conducive to growth, that probably changes, but on a flat basis, it's more capital efficiency, less CapEx, less wells to hit the same numbers longer term.\nPaul Cheng: Great. And Kaes, do you have an idea that what Endeavor gas exposure to Waha?\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. So listen, we've seen what exposure Endeavor has. I do think there's going to be a lot of opportunities for both of us combined to get gas outside of the basin. We got to close the deal first and then we can start making decisions. But I think both companies are aligned that more gas needs to get out of the basin and less exposure to Waha.\nPaul Cheng: Okay, thank you.\nKaes Van't Hof: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH. Your line is now open.\nLeo Mariani: I wanted to followup on some of the comments you made around the share buyback. Obviously you guys had leaned more on the variable dividend in the past quarter, but you certainly kind of indicated from some of your comments here on the call that given the recent pullback in the stock and the sector, the buyback was looking more palatable. I'm just trying to get a sense if you guys are able to start executing on the buyback here post quarter. Are there some restrictions in place with respect to the Endeavor deal that would prevent some of that over the next couple of months until the deal closes?\nTravis Stice: Yes, Leo, I don't think there's any more Endeavor specific restrictions. Obviously, we're now reporting earnings today, so we're in a blackout day. But I think these periods of weakness allow us to step in and we pre wire the buyback for every blackout period. And I think if we continue to see weakness here, we'll get opportunities. We just have a little more flexibility if the windows open versus closed.\nLeo Mariani: Okay, I appreciate that. And then just in your comments here and your guidance for the rest of the year, it looks like third quarter CapEx is coming down some versus 2Q. It certainly sounds like activity is falling a little bit in the second half of the year and some of the OFS cost reductions are kind of rolling through as well. I mean, do you see standalone without Endeavor, CapEx continuing to kind of drop a little bit and activity kind of dropping a little bit in 4Q as well. I'm just trying to get a sense that that's kind of the low point for spend and activity on a standalone basis here.\nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, I think it'll be the low point for spend because we're a cash CapEx reporter. I think the low point for activity will be this quarter. So I think we'll probably bring back our fourth simul-frac crew end of this quarter into the beginning of next quarter. That's all on a standalone basis and probably bring back a rig or two, but not much more than that, so I would say Q3 is the low for activity, Q4 is the low for CapEx.\nLeo Mariani: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: All right, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kalei Akamine of Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKalei Akamine: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of focus on field efficiency, so I'll leave that alone. I want to ask you guys about Deep Blue. The team over there continues to be very acquisitive. It looks like that business has grown about maybe 20% plus or minus over the past year in terms of capacity. Can you talk a little bit about the growth outlook for that business potential Endeavor, drop down included, and maybe help us understand what the scale of the business could be once it matures?\nTravis Stice: Yes. Listen, I think we're very pleased with what the Deep Blue team has done in a short period of time. It's kind of exactly why we did the deal with them. Right? They've got a lot of third party wins, wins that Diamondback wouldn't get if Diamondback was trying to gather someone else's water. And on top of that, a little bit of M&A to boost capacity and reduce costs there. So we're really excited with what they're doing. Endeavor has a very impressive water system that could be a candidate to merge with Deep Blue, but I think that the price has got to be right for Diamondback shareholders, and that's what we're focused on first. But, yes, listen, they're doing a really good job building a sizable business on the water side. And with the amount of water that it takes to run multiple simul-frac crews at the same time, you're moving hundreds of thousands of barrels of water a day at low cost. So very, very impressed with what they're doing. I don't think they're ready to monetize yet. It's a longer term investment for us and we look forward to continuing to support that business.\nKalei Akamine: Okay. From numbers, given the size of Endeavor, does it potentially double the size of that business?\nTravis Stice: It's probably a little less than double, probably about two-thirds the size of the business today. But it adds a lot of capacity and really moves into that Western Martin or Eastern Martin County area and connects the system nicely.\nKalei Akamine: Thanks for that. And then maybe following up on your comments on Wolf D and the Upper Sprayberry, can you talk a little bit about that program for this year? Talk about how you're layering those zones into your development plans, whether they're co-developed with other zones, for example, and if there's any learning to take away from this 2024 program.\nTravis Stice: Yes, I think so, we added the Upper Sprayberry as a test. Well, kind of in the North Martin area, like Kaes mentioned a couple of years ago, really pleased with the performance of that well. This year we've tested it in a co-developed fashion and like Kaes said, we're not seeing any real degradation there. And so what we plan to do going forward is to add that to the development zones for the North Martin area.\nKaes Van't Hof: I think we have some tests that are co-developed and some tests that are standalone. There are certain areas where the Wolfcamp D is significantly deeper than the Wolfcamp B, and we're not seeing communication. And there are some areas where it probably just makes sense to develop it with the stack because of above ground efficiencies.\nTravis Stice: Yes, I think that's right. We tested the Wolfcamp D kind of in that same North Martin area and really not seeing any communication with Wolfcamp B. So we think it's a zone that we can come back and get or where it competes for capital we'll add it to the stack.\nKalei Akamine: That's awesome. I appreciate that, guys.\nTravis Stice: Thank you.\nOperator: All right, thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.\nTravis Stice: Thank you again for everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions please reach out to us using the contact information we\u2019ve previously provided. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes, Neil. I mean, I think when we announced the deal, we were very conscious of the cash stock mix that we put in place for the Endeavor merger. I don't think we put it -- we didn't put so much cash in the deal that we had to be a seller of assets. But what you've seen us do is, sell multiple things now over the last couple quarters that start that up. Right? We sold a little bit of our Viper ownership to take some risk off the table and get some cash in the door. We sold our interest in WTG West Texas Gas to Energy Transfer. That will get some cash in the door. And then little things like our little mono [ph] sale that we did last quarter, all that kind of almost adds up to $1 billion, which on top of free cash flow generation between January 1 and today is going to reduce the cash outflow burden for the Endeavor deal. I think we planned on looking at the deal as a delevering process through free cash flow, but the asset sales are a kicker that accelerates that. And I think we're highly focused on getting to $10 billion as quickly as possible. And then I think things can slow down from there. But I don't think you'll see us be a forced seller of assets post deal close. And I think we're going to be very, very stingy on keeping operated properties in the Permian because they're kind of worth their weight in gold right now. Yes, that's been a big topic lately and obviously we need to start making more money on our gas in the Permian and Diamondback specifically. If you look back to the history of Diamondback, we've grown through acquisition. A lot of the deals that we've done have come with marketing contracts where we don't control the molecule much further than the wellhead. And so what we've been doing over the last, I'll call it five years, is that as contracts roll off, we've been taking advantage of that and getting taken kind of rights on that molecule. We started with our commitment to Whistler and have grown that. That combined with Matterhorn will have a little bit of gas on both of those. And then I think you saw our press release last week that we're going to be a participant in the next pipeline from those guys, the Blackcomb Pipeline. And I just think that fits the strategy of let's take control of our molecules and see what we can do with them and I don't think that stops at pipeline commitments. We're really looking at power needs in the basin. Things like our Verde gas to gasoline plant and trying to find ways to create a local market here in the Permian, because it's a shame that we continue to sell gas near zero or below zero. So it's on us to continue to improve that portfolio and I think with size and scale and time we'll be able to do that. Thanks, Neil. Sure. On the rig side, we specifically talked about bit and bottom hole assembly improvements and again, that's not necessarily the adoption of some new emerging technology. I think it's really another example of what our guys do really, really good, which is a laser-like focus on every decision that's made. They measure almost every attribute of drilling the well and they seek for improvement and they compete against one well versus the other and we pay bonuses to the crews out there when they execute in a stellar fashion. So it's not something, again, that's easily repeatable and it's not a shelf item that someone can go take, but it's a culture of execution that's always been part of this business. On the completion side, there's been some design changes where we've increased rate, but we've also continued to try to optimize the exact way that we mobilize equipment. We've done some changes on some pipe down hole that allows a greater rate with less friction loss. So, again, it's nothing that's a marquee item, but it's just intense focus on doing what it is that we do, which is really, really execute well when we convert rock into cash flow. Yes, I mean, I don't think wells are completed like they look to be completed in the spreadsheet. Right? I mean, in 22 well pads, you move one pad from 2023 into 2024 and you got 22 extra wells. So we kind of moved almost, I think, 30 wells from 2023 into 2024. So our well count is a little bit higher than maybe a true level loaded run rate would be. But I think we're also just preparing room for a major acquisition to close. And I think we're doing everything we can on our side to be prepared to hit the ground running and hit numbers right away and do exactly what you would expect us to do. So I think more importantly, it's the more drilled lateral footage for less CapEx that gives us a lot of flexibility in the second half of the year and carry that momentum into 2025. You bet. Thanks, Arun. Yes, I mean, I think, David, on the plan we can't put anything together until post close, but I think the priority for the teams right now is what does the plan look like end of 2024 and into 2025 post close and then what are the projects look like starting to back out to 2025 and into 2026, start to extend laterals. I mean, I think holding the level that we have this year, almost 12,000 feet on average for 300 wells is a pretty stellar number that we should probably look to maintain. I think going much further than that for a full program of 500 plus wells a year is going to be tough to do. But I don't think the guys are scared of drilling to 20,000 feet and if we have those opportunities, we'll take advantage of them. Thanks, David. And John, I think a good way to demonstrate or a good way to visualize the Board's commitment to this sustainable and growing dividend is on Slide 7. Go all the way back to 2018, when we initiated the dividend and you can see on that slide the growth rate. And on the bottom half of that slide, you can see that our commitment has translated into almost $8 billion of capital returned to our shareholders. So it is a meaningful lever that we have as a company and the Board's commitment to continue the sustainable and growing dividend. Yes, just where we sit right now, John, that's not a logical scenario that we see playing out in the next six months, three, four quarters. Yes, I mean, I think from a numbers perspective, the way we're thinking about it is the pro forma business will be running basically kind of 21, 22 rigs off the start, and then by 2025, we'll probably be averaging closer to 18 to 19 combined. And when we look at those details, we do it every quarter for sure. And what Danny is talking about requires a great deal of collaboration across all the teams. And even though I emphasize the competition aspect of what it is that we do, the collaborative aspect is really where this sits home, because when one team finds a solution, it's quickly shared with all the other teams internally. And in a similar fashion, if we find something externally, we would quickly adopt that as well, too. Yes. I mean, I think so, Charles. I think the point I was trying to make is that as a public company that has public guidance and quarterly guidance, we really work from guidance backwards, and we make what looks like an easy output on the surface is very difficult below the surface. There's a lot going on in terms of the teams being able to move things around and add rigs here and drop rigs there and the plan isn't always the plan. We got to be nimble and work together as a group. And I think that harmony we have across all of our functions is what makes us pretty unique, particularly also given that we're in one basin. So I would say the drilling improvements this year have been more surprising than the completion improvements because we always kind of thought that drilling was already near the asymptotic curve of what they've been able to do. Not to knock the frac guys, but the drilling improvements probably supersede the frac improvements here today. That's a little test for the FRAC guys to step it up next quarter. Thanks, Charles. Good morning, Paul. Paul, on your well count question, I think kind of low 500 is a good place to start and as low 500 dwells per year, but as you know, the land efficiencies accrue to us and laterals extend and the decline rate shallows a bit, you probably start to get below that 500 number should production stay flat. Now, if things are a market that's conducive to growth, that probably changes, but on a flat basis, it's more capital efficiency, less CapEx, less wells to hit the same numbers longer term. Yes. So listen, we've seen what exposure Endeavor has. I do think there's going to be a lot of opportunities for both of us combined to get gas outside of the basin. We got to close the deal first and then we can start making decisions. But I think both companies are aligned that more gas needs to get out of the basin and less exposure to Waha. Thanks, Paul. Yes, I think it'll be the low point for spend because we're a cash CapEx reporter. I think the low point for activity will be this quarter. So I think we'll probably bring back our fourth simul-frac crew end of this quarter into the beginning of next quarter. That's all on a standalone basis and probably bring back a rig or two, but not much more than that, so I would say Q3 is the low for activity, Q4 is the low for CapEx. I think we have some tests that are co-developed and some tests that are standalone. There are certain areas where the Wolfcamp D is significantly deeper than the Wolfcamp B, and we're not seeing communication. And there are some areas where it probably just makes sense to develop it with the stack because of above ground efficiencies."

            "name": "Travis Stice",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you continue to find the Stockholders Letter that we issued last night, an efficient way to communicate. We spent a lot of time putting that letter together, and there's a lot of material contained in the text. Operator, would you please open the line for questions? Sure. Good question, Neal. The first half of the year was really typified by us doing more with less. And you gave some numbers there, but just to, just to repeat some of those in January of this year, we estimated that we could get 24 wells per rig per year and now we're up to 26 wells per year for the rest of the year. And you see a similar efficiency gain on the completions, where we previously signaled 80 completions per year per crew, and now we're up to over 100 completions per crew per year. Those are simul-frac crews. And look, as we look into the future, one of the things that I get excited about is that these efficiencies are things that we don't get back. And so as we incorporate after close the new assets from Endeavor, I fully anticipate our operations organization combined with Endeavor's operations organization will be able to continue these results. And what's significant about that is when we talked to the market on February 12 announcing this deal, one of the biggest, the biggest synergy that we talked about was being able to apply Diamondback's current D&C cost on a larger asset. And I'm pleased to say today we're significantly below where we were in February. So that just accrues the benefit to our shareholders and, and really supercharges the delivery of the synergies that we were talking about. So, yes Neal, I'm very confident that we'll be able to continue this leading edge capital efficiency on a larger asset base. Yes Neal, I mean I think the key point here is we've always had a very flexible return of capital program. Since the very beginning, when we put this in place in 2021, we've said we'd like to be able to flex between buying back shares and paying a variable dividends and we take that capital allocation decision very, very seriously. So we're set up in a way where if you have periods of weakness like we've seen over the last week or two, that's when the buyback kicks in. And if it continues to be weak, we'll continue to buy back more shares. That's the benefit of having a low break even on your capital program, low break even on your base dividend, and continuing to generate free cash flow down to much lower numbers than peers or than what the market is used to. So I think we're excited. If things do stay weak, we'll flex that buyback and be aggressive there. And if things improve and we have a good quarter in the 80s or 90s on crude then and we'll pay a big variable dividend. But I think that flexibility has been very, very advantageous to our shareholders over the last three years. Listen, we were very focused on looking at our base dividend breakeven at $40 crude, so mid-cycle capital costs $40 crude, we could keep production flat. I don't think in a $40 crude scenario we would do that. I think kind of lessons learned from what we've seen through the cycles over the years is that it's okay to let production decline if we were in a very, very weak commodity price scenario. But in that scenario, we should be allocating 100% of our free cash flow or even more to buying back shares, because in that situation, your share price is going to be likely to be very weak. So we're really trying to move the capital allocation decision from the field and the assets to what do you do with your free cash flow and that's I think is a good place to be. Thanks, Arun. Well, first we're going to have to get the two assets put together, which we obviously can't do that currently. I'll let Kaes answer the synergy question specifically, but I wanted to highlight something that we talked about in our earnings release and our stockholder letter was that we drilled a 20,000 foot lateral well in under eight days, under nine days, seven, eight days. And longer is not going to be a problem. It's just we need to make sure we have the least geometry to be able to drill even longer wells. Yes John, I mean, I think those are two separate decisions, but I think you hit the nail on the head on as efficiencies accrue and our decline rate shallows over time and your balance sheet shrinks over time, that should create room there between your breakeven and your $40 dividend breakeven. So I think that's how we're still going to look at it. I think we see dollar $40 on the E&P side as a very well protected number. We're still going to buy puts at right now we're buying them at $55, $60 crude, but eventually probably reduce the value of our put buying down to closer to $50 just to protect the extreme downside scenario. And I think the rest of the free cash, we did move back from 75% of free cash going to equity down to $50. But that doesn't mean that number is not going to be higher in the future in times of stress. I think in times of stress or significant stress, the number should be a lot higher than 50% of free cash going to equity. And when things are going well, the numbers should be closer to 50, and we'll continue to build a fortress balance sheet. I've been very pleased with the response from our large shareholders on cutting back to 50% of free cash going to equity, because they want us to have a more fortress balance sheet than we even thought going into the deal. So I think that's been a pleasant relief and allows us to build a lot more cash and be ready for the inevitable down cycle in this sector. Yes, I mean, historically we've tried post-COVID favor free cash flow generation over growth, and I think you've seen that trend continue here with what we're doing in 2024. Mill. We're: So I think we've had a few really, really good years of well performance. We're always trying to keep pushing the performance side, but I think this year has been a year of cost gains versus well performance gains, but that doesn't mean there's not significant inventory expansion going on across our portfolio. Well, it's going to be hard work for sure. It's our job to do that hard work and make it look easy for you guys. There's some decisions that we'll make pretty soon after we combine the two companies. One would be the use of clear drilling fluids and the second would be to put more of the frac operations onto simul-frac. So those are the two biggest levers that have the quickest change. But look, we're also going to, like we've always done, check our egos at the door and make sure we seek to understand what the Endeavor team is already doing. And historically that's generated better results when we seek first to understand and then pick the best path forward with the combined inputs from legacy Diamondback, and the new asset, new management from Endeavor. So we're going to make it look easy, but there's going to be, it's hard work behind the scenes, but I'm really confident that both of the two leadership teams are going to be able to pull this off and make it look good. We do have a pretty healthy competition between internally and then we also every quarter we look externally and there's a pretty healthy competition. And that's why in our Stockholders Letter, I talked about in this quarter in the Midland Basin the drilling team got over 20,000 feet with a single bit run and that represents a record in the Midland Basin. So I'm sure that record will fall, but it's just part of the culture of evaluate internally and externally and compete to win and that's what our organization does. I think it kind of moves but you're getting to the point in time where, there's the little things we're focusing on now or the efficiency drivers. We talked in the last call about the guys focusing on pipe makeup speeds because that was where they saw the most NPT [ph] time on a well was just how long it takes them to break and make a pipe. And we're constantly looking at where that dead space is in these jobs and trying to attack it. And we don't just attack one dead space, we attack them all at the same time. And I think, you know, NPT [ph] time has been a focus of coming out of the really aggressive activity levels we saw in 2023. And we've really done a good job of reducing NPT time, but there are certainly always things we can focus on there to continue to drive uptime and drive constant performance and not waiting on the sidelines for something to be fixed. Good morning, Roger. Yes, I think on the NGL side, trying to put as much ethane as you can in the NGLs to get them out of the basin, we even probably throughout the second quarter, we saw obviously a lot of gas price weakness. So we did take a couple of our highest GOR wells down for a month or two to ease that pressure. So I think even in the face of that, the gas curve continues to outperform expectations. But we kind of even curtailed a little bit of oil to make sure our gas production was a little bit lower in the quarter, which we kind of have continued in the third. So we just have a lot of gas production out of this basin, and that's kind of why we have such a focus now on trying to generate more value for the gas that we're producing, whether that be in basin or out of basin. Yes, listen, the rig per year number is an output of getting 300 wells per year drilled. Right? It's really about net lateral footage or gross lateral footage drilled per year per rig. I think Danny is talking about 30 wells per rig. Well, I think if we're drilling more Wolfcamp D with a particular rig, that rig is going to be a little slower. But I think the general standard Wolfberry development is pushing that upper, upper echelon, but we really see the rig count as the output of what we need to do from a drilling perspective on hitting production guidance. No problem. Yes, I mean, we've looked a lot at trimul-frac, and the struggle for us is the infrastructure spend we'd have to implement to get to trimul-frac across our portfolio. And does that additional infrastructure spend, do we recognize the return on that from the efficiency gains from moving from simul-frac to trimul-frac? We think the cost benefit somewhere in the move from simul-frac to trimul-frac, certainly something we would pursue in areas where we have the infrastructure in place to do so. And if we have available enough development in that area, in those areas to dedicate a trimul-frac crew, you would see us move that direction very quickly. Hi, Charles. Thanks, Charles. Good morning, Paul. Well, I'll talk specifically about your look ahead for two to three years and I think if you put it in one bucket, it would be in the down-hole sensing technology that allows the bit to stay in the best rock, the highest percentage of time. And then on the completion side, understanding using downhill sensing, where you can place the most frac energy in the most efficient way that creates the greatest stimulated rock volume. And these sensing technologies are evolving very, very rapidly. I think before too long we'll be able to actually sense in front of the drill bit and drill towards a target rather than drilling past it and making adjustments. And that sounds like a small change, but I think the sensing technology that we're right on the cusp of having some of those problems solved is going to be a real game changer for our industry. Yes, Leo, I don't think there's any more Endeavor specific restrictions. Obviously, we're now reporting earnings today, so we're in a blackout day. But I think these periods of weakness allow us to step in and we pre wire the buyback for every blackout period. And I think if we continue to see weakness here, we'll get opportunities. We just have a little more flexibility if the windows open versus closed. Yes. Listen, I think we're very pleased with what the Deep Blue team has done in a short period of time. It's kind of exactly why we did the deal with them. Right? They've got a lot of third party wins, wins that Diamondback wouldn't get if Diamondback was trying to gather someone else's water. And on top of that, a little bit of M&A to boost capacity and reduce costs there. So we're really excited with what they're doing. Endeavor has a very impressive water system that could be a candidate to merge with Deep Blue, but I think that the price has got to be right for Diamondback shareholders, and that's what we're focused on first. But, yes, listen, they're doing a really good job building a sizable business on the water side. And with the amount of water that it takes to run multiple simul-frac crews at the same time, you're moving hundreds of thousands of barrels of water a day at low cost. So very, very impressed with what they're doing. I don't think they're ready to monetize yet. It's a longer term investment for us and we look forward to continuing to support that business. It's probably a little less than double, probably about two-thirds the size of the business today. But it adds a lot of capacity and really moves into that Western Martin or Eastern Martin County area and connects the system nicely. Yes, I think so, we added the Upper Sprayberry as a test. Well, kind of in the North Martin area, like Kaes mentioned a couple of years ago, really pleased with the performance of that well. This year we've tested it in a co-developed fashion and like Kaes said, we're not seeing any real degradation there. And so what we plan to do going forward is to add that to the development zones for the North Martin area. Yes, I think that's right. We tested the Wolfcamp D kind of in that same North Martin area and really not seeing any communication with Wolfcamp B. So we think it's a zone that we can come back and get or where it competes for capital we'll add it to the stack. Thank you. Thank you again for everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions please reach out to us using the contact information we've previously provided. Thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Danny Wesson",
            "content": "Yes, listen Arun, I mean all these things certainly have accrued to us since we announced the Endeavor merger in February. I think, as Travis mentioned earlier on the call, these are permanent items that aren't going to go away from service cost inflation or deflation. So as we work through the pro forma model, we're probably thinking that we're going to run closer to 18 to 20 rigs next year, versus 22 to 24 a while back, and closer to four to five simul-frac crews versus five plus. So we're certainly modeling these things accruing for the good guys, and it only give us a head start on the promises we made on 2025 numbers. Well, that's why I highlighted, David, that where we are today is much better in performance and execution than where we were just in February when we talked to you about this deal. These are cultural elements, this attention to detail, this focus, this laser-like attention to execution. And we look forward to bringing on our new friends from Endeavor. And look, David, from what we hear from them anecdotally, they're seeing similar efficiency gains as well, too. So when we put the two cultures together, I expect it to be an add or not a detractor when we actually put the two companies together here before too much longer. Hey Bob, it's Danny. Yes, I mean I think the crews and the rigs are pretty well all within a margin of error of each other in their performance. We've been really pretty active on fleet management over the past few years and continue to optimize our fleet where we see dwindling performance. And the best thing about our operation is the collaboration we have between the teams on sharing best practices on best-in-class rigs. So when we look at the rigs across the board there's always one pace setting rig, but that tends to move around as we share best practices and the other rigs catch up and then another one will pass that rig. So not one unique standout that's driving that number. It's pretty well across the board at that same level of efficiency. Yes. And just to add to that, the focus on around environmental performance has driven a lot of decisions to not burn gas in the field for energy consumption and instead convert that energy demand to electrical demand. And so you're seeing a lot of gas that would have otherwise been burnt in the field to run our operation being put down the pipeline. And then on top of that, the focus on reducing, flaring those are all things that send gas to sales and get reported as a production number. That's driving some of that increase you're seeing across the basin. I think, it's a good question. It just depends. But we certainly have some rigs that are drilling at a pace of 30 plus wells a year. Just depends on which zones and lateral links and all that kind of stuff. But we're really focusing on pad cycle times and how to reduce the full pad cycle time. These are large pads and give driving flexibility in the plan by reducing that cycle time on the pads is really what's important to us. And so if we have one rig that's outperforming the others in one zone, we want to look at that zone, what that rig is doing and kind of share it with the other rigs so that we can accrue that benefit to all the pad development across our portfolio. I'm sorry, just to rephrase your question, are you asking what's their percentage of three mile laterals to? I think our 15,000 footers this year were like at 25%-ish of our development. Thanks, Roger."

Can you spend more time on that? And as it relates to that, how do you think about the timing of debottlenecking Permian gas? \nTravis Stice: Well, from a macro perspective, I think we've been pretty clear that we're going to continue to need pipes being built about every 12 to 18 months out of the Permian to accommodate the associated gas that goes along with just 6 million barrels a day that we produce out here. Natural gas is right now being almost like a waste product, and we've got it. This -- when matter workup zone this fall, we'll see some of that reverse. But Kaes, do you want to give them some description of what we're doing in the rest of the gas? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neil, I mean, this will be long term, we want to be able to contribute to more pipes. We've done that in the last couple of years with commitments on Whistler and  Matterhorn. We've relinquished taking kind rights in other areas to commit to other pipes that were built. As Travis said, we just need to do more. And I think with our size and scale and balance sheet, we should be taking a leadership position on these new pipes. We've talked to a lot of people that are working on them today, and it seems that there are projects in the works that will help the bottleneck past the end of this year. But as we control or have the ability to control more gas flows on our side, as contracts roll off, et cetera, we're going to keep pushing on more pipes and more markets out of this basin. \nNeil Mehta: Yes. And then the second is capital efficiency. You talked about the 10% improvement that you're expecting per lateral foot. So just talk about what you're seeing real time in terms of deflation. And then also, what are those the next steps in terms of driving your cost structure lower as we think about efficiency of fleet? \nTravis Stice: Well, I think the deflationary pressures we continue to see in the Permian are being driven by the decline in the rig count and the decline in the completion crew count. Those will be tailwinds for us as we look through the rest of this year. But also without regards to those deflationary impacts, we continue to push the envelope on our D&C operations where we're getting -- I think we averaged almost 13,000 feet for the quarter this year, and we continue to get these wells drilled faster and then our completion crews continue to push the envelope on the number of lateral feet that are completed in a 24-hour period. So we're working on the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency and really like the way the rest of the year sets up for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun  Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. \nArun Jayaram: Travis, you and the team had highlighted up to $550 million of annualized synergy capture in the transaction in the Midland Basin, including a 150-foot decline. And do you see any cost in the Midland Basin to that $600 million to $650 million range? Maybe a follow-up to Neil's question, but where are you seeing kind of leading-edge cost today in the Midland Basin as you continue to push those lateral links a bit longer? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, this is Kaes. I think the combination of those longer laterals, 12,000-plus with some efficiencies on the completion side that we probably weren't expecting going into the year as well as some softening on the service side makes us feel pretty good that we're in the lower half of that $600 to $650 a foot in the Midland Basin. As you know, 90% of our capital is being allocated to that basin. So with those costs trending in the right direction, I think on a real-time basis, closer to $600 a foot, we feel really, really good about our plan this year as well as carrying that momentum into a Q4 close. The Endeavor deal and into 2025. Very clearly, we laid out some strong synergy targets and a very strong capital-efficient 2025 plan, and we still feel very, very confident in that plan. \nArun Jayaram: Great. Kaes, looking at the quarter, you didn't really -- how many activity in terms of [ TILs ] in the Delaware Basin. Can you give us some thoughts on the Delaware program? I know it's 10% of the program, but what's your thoughts on the Delaware as we think about moving on into the back half of this year and into next year? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Listen, there's still a place for the Delaware program. There are still some really good projects coming up in Q2. I think we have a project in that Romeo area, Northern East County that's going to be very good. I think generally, with large pad development, you're going to see pockets of development in the Delaware rather than consistent development because we want to go over there and complete multiple wells, multiple pads in a row and keep that capital efficiency high versus the Midland Basin where 3 or 4 simul-frac crews are going to be running at all times. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. \nDavid Deckelbaum: Maybe this question is for both of you guys. But considering the positioning a bit early with the debt that you raised earlier this month, now the expectation that the deal will close at the end of the year with Endeavor. You talked about kind of the synergy expectations in the last series of questions. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that initial sort of noncore sale asset target and maybe some of the updated timing around those thoughts, considering the market's changed a bit, especially around the cash consideration portion? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think what's changed is just timing, right? I think the projects we see as noncore asset sales or the asset sales to subsidiaries we have is still the same. Endeavor has a really good midstream business that would fit well with our midstream JV. They have a significant mineral business that I think is going to be a game changer for Viper if those 2 businesses are combined. And our strategy to execute on those trades has not changed. It's just been pushed out to the right. So on top of that, there's an $8 billion cash consideration, that continues to be worked down with free cash flow between sign and close. \n I think that just means, we have to pony up less cash at close in Q4. And we raised the money a couple of weeks ago because we were preparing to potentially close the deal as early as today. Unfortunately, the deal has been pushed out due to regulatory review, but we had to be ready to fund the deal, and that's where we were. Fortunately, the bond deal was pretty well-timed. We're actually earning very minimal negative carry on the cash that we have sitting at the banks today, and we'll be ready to use it when we close in a couple of quarters. \nDavid Deckelbaum: Maybe just to follow up a little bit more on just the gas pipeline side. Just for my own edification, just some clarity. Just you highlighted you didn't have any issues with egress. You have Matterhorn coming online in the third quarter. Is there a point as you look forward, where you anticipate egress issues? Or is this more appearing to be just more proactive to get involved with taking on firm capacity in future pipelines? Do you need to take a more active role beyond that? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Well, I mean, we're facing them right now, egress issues, right, not on the physical side, but it's really on the price side. So I think if we can remove the pricing aspect of pricing modules in Waha versus pricing them further downstream and just paying a fixed fee on the pipe. That to us is a risk mitigation strategy that makes sense for Diamondback shareholders. So I think we see the gas forecast continuing to increase. If you do look back the big public third-party services and what they thought gas production was going to be in 2024, they've all been wrong. So it's always been more gas sooner. And so for us, we need to handle that physically where we can. And with our balance sheet and size and scale, we can sign those 10-year deals because we know we're going to be around to produce for a very, very long time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. \nScott Hanold: I'm just going to stick on the gas team as well because it is very topical, but it sounds like, and just correct me if I'm wrong, you guys feel good about your development program on a Diamondback stand-alone basis as well as with Endeavor with gas capacity, at least for the foreseeable future and just confirm that's correct? And if you could also maybe opine on just broader Permian in general, do you expect other operators to see some physical constraints not being able to get their gas out and potential shut-ins related to that? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Scott, we're 100% confident in our plan. I think we have a lot of visibility. We have more and more physical space coming our way. Every molecule is moved to date. I don't like the speculation blame game in the Permian about who's going to be able to move or not. I'm focused on Diamondback, and we're going to be in really good shape. \nScott Hanold: Okay. Fair enough. And then my next question is on stock buybacks. Obviously, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit more tempered until the deal closes with Endeavor, but can you give us your thought process on buybacks post-merger and how you think about the intrinsic value of the combined company? And what mid-cycle price makes sense to underpin that? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think philosophically, part of the move back to 50% of free cash flow returned every quarter allows us to build more cash, pay down debt faster, but also make the bigger bets on buybacks, right? In a single quarter, if you're having to distribute 75% of your free cash flow, you don't get to really make the big bet on the buyback at the right time. And so this flexibility will allow us to do that. Clearly, we've been a little limited on buybacks since announcing the deal. I would expect that to stay about the same here in the second and third quarters depending upon the market. \n If we see some weakness, we're going to step in and support the stock. But longer term, we want to make the 9-figure, 10-figure bets on buybacks at the right time, and that's the flexibility we want on capital return. I think we still see kind of mid-cycle in the $60 to $70 range. I think we were firmly 60 for a long time. We're probably closer to $70, $20 and $2 or $3 gas. And in the combined business, you look at what we have with Endeavor, there's a significant amount of inventory and a lot of NAV accretion. So -- and probably a lower combined cost of capital. So I think we feel like we can raise that buyback up a little bit, but we're probably going to be cautious until we close. \nScott Hanold: Yes. Just to clarify a couple of points. Just broadly speaking, how much accretion do you all feel Endeavor added? And can you give us a sense of like when you think about cost of capital, like what were you kind of thinking before when you did intrinsic value. Was it like a 10% kind of flat? Or do you get a little bit more scientific with that? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. We've always been a little higher than 10%. I think in after-tax [PV-12] felt like at a mid-cycle price, felt like a very conservative price to buy back shares. And that also makes sure we don't get trapped into a positive feedback loop of buying back shares all the way to the top. So I think an after tax, 12% rate of return in this business is a really good rate of return at a mid-cycle price, and that keeps you in a good spot through the cycle. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. \nRoger Read: Yes. I'd like to come back on the, let's call it, efficiencies and lower costs. Obviously, some part of that, as you mentioned, was service competition, rig on rig, crew on crew lowering costs. But if you look at the underlying improvements you cite e-fracs over a diesel frac, kind of where do you think we are in terms of running through continued efficiencies there as we, let's say, alter the equipment, maybe alter the methods of doing some of the wells and with the danger of crossing the line here to post Endeavor, kind of what you see as maybe a year or 2 out in terms of continued efficiency gains. \nDaniel Wesson: Yes. Good question. We are continuing to drive costs out of the business through our operational plan and execution. On the completion side, A lot of that's going to come in the way of getting any fleets off of generated power and on to some form of grid power where we can recognize a lower energy source cost. We're continuing to try to drive days out of our execution, and we're kind of on the asymptotic slope of that efficiency gains that we are getting to a point where the fixed cost of the wells are a significant -- significantly larger portion of the cost of the well than the variable cost. So we're getting to a point where the variable costs that we're going to impact our pennies and nickels and not as much the dollars anymore and to get those large chunks, we're going to have to think about doing things differently as far as the physical plan for the wells and what we are going to consume as part of the fixed cost of the wells. \nTravis Stice: Roger, I give our guys some joke with them a little bit on the drilling side because they're almost to the point where they're spending more time screwing pipe together and unscreen pipe together than they are actual rotating hours and the lateral, not quite, but they keep certainly pushing the envelope. And really, if you go back to what we said during the acquisition announcement with the merger announcement with Endeavor, we talked about $150 a foot. $100 of that foot was from just simply going to a simul frac and the other $50 a foot was going to clear fluids. And really, that's what we're doing today. So we emphasized at the time. That's not a big stretch. It's just simply doing what we're doing today on a new set of assets. And in Dan's comments, we're spot on as well. \nRoger Read: Got you. So we just need somebody to come up with the next better mousetrap out there for the step functions. I appreciate that. \nKaes Van't Hof: Listen, Roger, one other comment on that. I mean the guys are so good on the drilling side now. They're measuring how thick the threading is between casing and on the drilling side to say, \"Can I screw that pipe together half a second faster versus what I used to do.\" I mean it is down to the absolute second on-site to reduce those variable costs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. \nJohn Freeman: Just following up on these efficiency drivers. Obviously, in the quarter, the wells that you all completed, the 101 wells, they were right in line on the lateral length of what your guidance was for the full year around that 11,500 feet. But obviously, you all point out the 69 wells that you all drilled in the Midland Basin that were significantly longer than that over $13,000 a foot, obviously, first-class problem given the capital efficiency you're seeing on these longer laterals. But should we still use that full year guide of 11,500-foot average for the year? Is that still applicable? Or should we consider that probably moving up relative to the original guide? \nDaniel Wesson: Yes, John. I think in the first quarter, those longer laterals were really just a function of where we were completing the wells that average lateral length of 11,500 is what we expect to see for the rest of the year. \nJohn Freeman: Okay. And then just shifting gears a little bit on the topic of, I'm trying to get a sense of like how much you are able to do sort of in advance of the Endeavor deal closing. And I know that in those initial efficiencies that you all laid out, things like, maybe pricing power supply chain, things like that weren't even necessarily priced into those initial synergies. So I'm trying to get a sense of like how much can you all do in advance in terms of negotiating with some of your service providers in anticipation of sort of a larger combined entity buying in bulk, things like that, like how much of that, if at all, can you do in advance or you just kind of have to sit and kind of wait until the deal closes to kind of get running on that stuff? \nTravis Stice: Yes, John, we got to operate as separate companies until the deal closes, and those things will come to the benefits of the combined company, but certainly can't influence any outcomes until deals were closed. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. \nNeal Dingmann: Travis, my question for you, okay, is just on the marketing side. You are looking not only from a capital efficiency, but it seems like from a takeaway, you all continue to get better and better sort of realized margin. I'm just wondering, now with the larger size, or I guess when that closes, what type of benefits will you continue to see the benefits on the back end that you've been seeing on the company? Because it seems like noticeable that a lot of your margins and all just on the marketing side continue to improve. \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Neal, I mean, I think -- I don't think we're going to see much more improvement. I think it's -- for us, it's more about risk aversion, right, and having our barrels and molecules go to different, bigger markets downstream. So we have a lot of oil that goes to the Gulf Coast in Corpus and is exported. We now have a good amount of oil going to Houston feed refineries there. So I think we've kind of grown up as a company in terms of marketing. And very clearly, mistakes for May 5, 6, 7 years ago when the Permian got tight, and we're just not looking to make those mistakes again. So with our size and scale, we're going to be contributing to oil pipes, contributing to new gas pipes. \n We've made some investments in gatherers and processors and many midstream investments throughout the years here that 1 made our shareholders' money on the investment side, but to protected us on the commercial side. So I'd expect that trend to continue as we get bigger. \nNeal Dingmann: That Kaes, you're saying you'll continue to contract more of those longer-term marketing contracts then? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I think our philosophy is to get our barrels to the most liquid bigger market and very clearly, selling within Midland or in the Midland market has not always been the most beneficial to our shareholders. There are pockets of time when the Midland market is very loose, but there are also periods where it gets very, very tight. So the way we see this physical marketing protection is a long-term insurance policy to make sure our barrels move to the right market. \nNeal Dingmann: Okay. And then just quickly on project size. You all continue to do a fantastic job not only that you have the larger projects, let's call it, on average, 6, 4-well pads, things on that nature, but you seem to have the flexibility that the larger and oftentimes the majors don't on those projects. Will that continue to be sort of the standard for you all going forward on these larger projects where -- and you'll maintain that flexibility or maybe you could just hit on that briefly. \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean you can go on for hours about that. I mean, that ties the culture, right? And our biggest benefit at Diamondback is that we have a small company dynamic culture with a large asset base that's now growing larger. So we are going to have to make sure we maintain that gritty quick, fast-moving adaptive culture to a larger asset base. I'm fully confident that we have the exec team and employee base to both at Diamondback and Endeavor to do that. And I think these big projects, there's a lot of capital being put in the ground before first oil sometimes upwards of $250 million, $300 million, but as long as you have the ability to move crews and rigs within a quarter, within a year, keep hitting numbers, we're going to keep doing that at a larger scale. \nTravis Stice: And Neal, as we built this company over the last 10 years, we've always maintained a couple of constants. One is the fact that we keep a real flat organization. And we keep a non-siloed organization as well too. And the only way that you can grow an organization and maintain that effectively is to have an unreasonable level of trust. And as we encourage our -- the Endeavor employees to come over, we're going to be demonstrating this high level of trust because it's going to be a very important part of our evolving culture as a much larger company. But those 2 things will stay the same, flat organization, no silos. \nNeal Dingmann: Look forward to the new assets, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. \nDerrick Whitfield: Congrats on another solid brand. With my first question, I wanted to focus on the second request from the FTC at a high level. Art Research indicates that most of the larger transactions have received that. Is that consistent with how you're thinking about it? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, that's consistent. \nDerrick Whitfield: All right. Terrific. And then shifting over to ops. So during the quarter, you completed 3 additional Upper Spraberry wells.  Based on those results and some from last year, could you speak to how the interval competes in your portfolio and if it's likely to get added to your inventory charts on Page 21? \nDaniel Wesson: Yes, Derrick. We followed up this year with -- in Q1 with 3 additional Upper Spraberry completions kind of following up that success that we had in the North Martin area with that first test. And we really like the initial results from those wells. And I think that from a cost perspective, we're seeing those costs be pretty competitive. And I think we'll probably look at adding that development to subsequent developments in the future. \nKaes Van't Hof: I think to fill this up to the top of that, Derrick. If you start to add in zones like Upper Spraberry, Wolfcamp D, we've got some really good Wolfcamp D tests in some of those same pads. If you start to add those in and you don't see degradation on a corporate basis in terms of the cume curves that everyone looks at so closely every year. That's inventory extension in our existing asset base. And with the combination of us and Endeavor, adding in zones like the Upper Spraberry, Wolfcamp D into full-scale development, only extends the duration of what we can do here in the Midland Basin. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. \nPaul Cheng: Travis, is that in your presentation, you have an interesting statement on the ESG, you intend to eventually invest in income-generating projects that are expect to more directly offset remaining Scope 1 emissions. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how big is the kind of investment? Are you expecting that to become a new division or that a new business for you? Or that is -- when it is going to be pretty small scale and result pay over the too much attention on that. That's the first question. \n The second question is interestingly that the E&P producer, no one really talking much about AI, but the service provider, now it's number they start to brand about say, how AI is going to drive their revenue and it's going to allow the improvement of EUR and productivities -- of the well productivity. So just curious that is Diamondback, you guys have been always do a lot on the technology. Have you tested on the AI application and whether that you see that going to be meaningfully change your EUR or your well productivities. \nTravis Stice: Well, the first emphasis on AI has been not degenerative AI, but using AI to process data information a lot quicker. And so, look, we're really excited about the long-term implications of AI on our industry, whether that translates to improvements in AUR or improvements in efficiencies or hopefully both, I think, is yet to be determined. But it's one of those things that we're trying to be fast followers on. This is arena of our industry that's moving incredibly fast. These electric frac fleets that we're using right now actually are accumulating more information than we can process. So we're storing some of that information and hoping to use smart algorithms or AI to help us process that information in a more usable and more real-time fashion.  Kaes, this first question was the income-generating tech to offset that. \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. I mean we have a subsidiary snake company called Cottonmouth Ventures, that's kind of our new ventures snake, I'll call it. But it's not a huge business today. I think one of the more exciting projects we're working on is with our Verde Clean Fuels partnership where we are in the scoping phase of building a plant, a gasoline plant in the basin that's going to be tapped into one of the pipelines that we are participant in. That plant will convert 35 million cubic feet a day of gas -- natural gas, lean gas into 3,000 barrels a day of gasoline. \n So that, I think, fits our model of, if we can contribute molecules and expertise to a project, not just capital, but the other things, to drive value. We're going to look at it. I would say that project might FID by the end of this year and be up and running in a couple of years, and that might be a good little offtake for 35 million a day of gas. And if it works, we're going to build more of them. \nTravis Stice: Paul, when you look at the capital program, it's going to spend between $4 billion and $5 billion a year on a pro forma basis. The percent of that, that we're going to allocate to income-generating projects is probably pretty small and that in an individual sense, it will probably have a larger impact, but I wouldn't expect it to move up to the noticeable level on a company that's spending between $4 billion and $5 billion a year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. \nLeo Mariani: I just wanted to touch base on sort of activity cadence this year. It looks like you guys had kind of 89 first quarter completions, all in the Midland, but that's a pretty healthy percentage, about 32% of your full year budget on completions.  Is there some anticipation that maybe some slowdown as the year goes and just seem like a quicker pace than I expected here in the first quarter. \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes, Leo, a couple of things. I think we're having a pretty good end of the year last year into Q4, and so we pushed completions into Q1. So Q1 looks a little high relative I think generally you can think about that 70 to 80 overall completion a quarter as the base case. Q2 might be a little towards the high end there. But because we're a little bit ahead of plan in terms of efficiencies and timing we're probably going to reduce our frac crew count by 1 for a period of time over the summer as well as kind of get down into that 12, 13 rigs on the drilling side to complete -- to drill the same number of wells. So we look at the plan almost weekly with the planning team. And I think, generally, the efficiencies have led to less overall activity, more capital efficiency and setting us up well for this potential close here in Q4 with Endeavor. \nLeo Mariani: No, that's helpful color. And then just shifting over to asset sales. You obviously talked a little bit about sort of when the Endeavor deal closes, maybe moving some midstream assets into your Deep Blue JV and also a drop-down to Viper. Outside of some of the Endeavor-related asset sales, is there anything else that you guys are sort of working on. You talked about raising cash for, just from free cash flow here over the next handful of months until the deal closes. But just trying to get a sense if you guys are looking at other asset sales in the interim. \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. Not many. We sold a piece of our Viper ownership in the first quarter, and that plugged another $450 million of cash on the balance sheet. And I think I'll go back to when we structured this deal. We certainly do not want to put so much cash into the deal with Endeavor that we had to be a seller of assets, and that's exactly what we've done. Now I think we've had some price help here in the last couple of months that has boosted free cash flow and reduced the cash portion of the transaction. And listen, I think the price has got to be right for any asset sale, whether it's the Deep Blue, Viper or otherwise. And we're going to be patient post-close. I do think those assets make sense in other hands, but it's got to be the right value. \nLeo Mariani: Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask about your production kind of severance tax here. You give the guiding to kind of 7% of revenue. It's kind of come in below that the last handful of quarters, closer to 5% to 6%. Just wanted to see what was kind of going on there. Maybe that was kind of anomalous in the last handful of quarters and 7% the right number going forward? \nKaes Van't Hof: Yes. It was just higher than that before then, a couple of quarters before that, and we had to work off the accruals. That number has been 7% for 10 years. We had a consultant that told us it was going to be higher last year, and that consultant is no longer working for us, but it's going to be 7% on an annual basis on average. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Travis Stice. \nTravis Stice: Thank you again to everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thank you, and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kaes Van't Hof",
            "content": "Yes, Neil, I mean, this will be long term, we want to be able to contribute to more pipes. We've done that in the last couple of years with commitments on Whistler and  Matterhorn. We've relinquished taking kind rights in other areas to commit to other pipes that were built. As Travis said, we just need to do more. And I think with our size and scale and balance sheet, we should be taking a leadership position on these new pipes. We've talked to a lot of people that are working on them today, and it seems that there are projects in the works that will help the bottleneck past the end of this year. But as we control or have the ability to control more gas flows on our side, as contracts roll off, et cetera, we're going to keep pushing on more pipes and more markets out of this basin. Yes, this is Kaes. I think the combination of those longer laterals, 12,000-plus with some efficiencies on the completion side that we probably weren't expecting going into the year as well as some softening on the service side makes us feel pretty good that we're in the lower half of that $600 to $650 a foot in the Midland Basin. As you know, 90% of our capital is being allocated to that basin. So with those costs trending in the right direction, I think on a real-time basis, closer to $600 a foot, we feel really, really good about our plan this year as well as carrying that momentum into a Q4 close. The Endeavor deal and into 2025. Very clearly, we laid out some strong synergy targets and a very strong capital-efficient 2025 plan, and we still feel very, very confident in that plan. Yes. Listen, there's still a place for the Delaware program. There are still some really good projects coming up in Q2. I think we have a project in that Romeo area, Northern East County that's going to be very good. I think generally, with large pad development, you're going to see pockets of development in the Delaware rather than consistent development because we want to go over there and complete multiple wells, multiple pads in a row and keep that capital efficiency high versus the Midland Basin where 3 or 4 simul-frac crews are going to be running at all times. Yes. I think what's changed is just timing, right? I think the projects we see as noncore asset sales or the asset sales to subsidiaries we have is still the same. Endeavor has a really good midstream business that would fit well with our midstream JV. They have a significant mineral business that I think is going to be a game changer for Viper if those 2 businesses are combined. And our strategy to execute on those trades has not changed. It's just been pushed out to the right. So on top of that, there's an $8 billion cash consideration, that continues to be worked down with free cash flow between sign and close. \n I think that just means, we have to pony up less cash at close in Q4. And we raised the money a couple of weeks ago because we were preparing to potentially close the deal as early as today. Unfortunately, the deal has been pushed out due to regulatory review, but we had to be ready to fund the deal, and that's where we were. Fortunately, the bond deal was pretty well-timed. We're actually earning very minimal negative carry on the cash that we have sitting at the banks today, and we'll be ready to use it when we close in a couple of quarters. Yes. Well, I mean, we're facing them right now, egress issues, right, not on the physical side, but it's really on the price side. So I think if we can remove the pricing aspect of pricing modules in Waha versus pricing them further downstream and just paying a fixed fee on the pipe. That to us is a risk mitigation strategy that makes sense for Diamondback shareholders. So I think we see the gas forecast continuing to increase. If you do look back the big public third-party services and what they thought gas production was going to be in 2024, they've all been wrong. So it's always been more gas sooner. And so for us, we need to handle that physically where we can. And with our balance sheet and size and scale, we can sign those 10-year deals because we know we're going to be around to produce for a very, very long time. Yes, Scott, we're 100% confident in our plan. I think we have a lot of visibility. We have more and more physical space coming our way. Every molecule is moved to date. I don't like the speculation blame game in the Permian about who's going to be able to move or not. I'm focused on Diamondback, and we're going to be in really good shape. Yes. I think philosophically, part of the move back to 50% of free cash flow returned every quarter allows us to build more cash, pay down debt faster, but also make the bigger bets on buybacks, right? In a single quarter, if you're having to distribute 75% of your free cash flow, you don't get to really make the big bet on the buyback at the right time. And so this flexibility will allow us to do that. Clearly, we've been a little limited on buybacks since announcing the deal. I would expect that to stay about the same here in the second and third quarters depending upon the market. \n If we see some weakness, we're going to step in and support the stock. But longer term, we want to make the 9-figure, 10-figure bets on buybacks at the right time, and that's the flexibility we want on capital return. I think we still see kind of mid-cycle in the $60 to $70 range. I think we were firmly 60 for a long time. We're probably closer to $70, $20 and $2 or $3 gas. And in the combined business, you look at what we have with Endeavor, there's a significant amount of inventory and a lot of NAV accretion. So -- and probably a lower combined cost of capital. So I think we feel like we can raise that buyback up a little bit, but we're probably going to be cautious until we close. Yes. We've always been a little higher than 10%. I think in after-tax [PV-12] felt like at a mid-cycle price, felt like a very conservative price to buy back shares. And that also makes sure we don't get trapped into a positive feedback loop of buying back shares all the way to the top. So I think an after tax, 12% rate of return in this business is a really good rate of return at a mid-cycle price, and that keeps you in a good spot through the cycle. Listen, Roger, one other comment on that. I mean the guys are so good on the drilling side now. They're measuring how thick the threading is between casing and on the drilling side to say, \"Can I screw that pipe together half a second faster versus what I used to do.\" I mean it is down to the absolute second on-site to reduce those variable costs. Yes, Neal, I mean, I think -- I don't think we're going to see much more improvement. I think it's -- for us, it's more about risk aversion, right, and having our barrels and molecules go to different, bigger markets downstream. So we have a lot of oil that goes to the Gulf Coast in Corpus and is exported. We now have a good amount of oil going to Houston feed refineries there. So I think we've kind of grown up as a company in terms of marketing. And very clearly, mistakes for May 5, 6, 7 years ago when the Permian got tight, and we're just not looking to make those mistakes again. So with our size and scale, we're going to be contributing to oil pipes, contributing to new gas pipes. \n We've made some investments in gatherers and processors and many midstream investments throughout the years here that 1 made our shareholders' money on the investment side, but to protected us on the commercial side. So I'd expect that trend to continue as we get bigger. Yes. I think our philosophy is to get our barrels to the most liquid bigger market and very clearly, selling within Midland or in the Midland market has not always been the most beneficial to our shareholders. There are pockets of time when the Midland market is very loose, but there are also periods where it gets very, very tight. So the way we see this physical marketing protection is a long-term insurance policy to make sure our barrels move to the right market. Yes. I mean you can go on for hours about that. I mean, that ties the culture, right? And our biggest benefit at Diamondback is that we have a small company dynamic culture with a large asset base that's now growing larger. So we are going to have to make sure we maintain that gritty quick, fast-moving adaptive culture to a larger asset base. I'm fully confident that we have the exec team and employee base to both at Diamondback and Endeavor to do that. And I think these big projects, there's a lot of capital being put in the ground before first oil sometimes upwards of $250 million, $300 million, but as long as you have the ability to move crews and rigs within a quarter, within a year, keep hitting numbers, we're going to keep doing that at a larger scale. Yes, that's consistent. I think to fill this up to the top of that, Derrick. If you start to add in zones like Upper Spraberry, Wolfcamp D, we've got some really good Wolfcamp D tests in some of those same pads. If you start to add those in and you don't see degradation on a corporate basis in terms of the cume curves that everyone looks at so closely every year. That's inventory extension in our existing asset base. And with the combination of us and Endeavor, adding in zones like the Upper Spraberry, Wolfcamp D into full-scale development, only extends the duration of what we can do here in the Midland Basin. Yes. I mean we have a subsidiary snake company called Cottonmouth Ventures, that's kind of our new ventures snake, I'll call it. But it's not a huge business today. I think one of the more exciting projects we're working on is with our Verde Clean Fuels partnership where we are in the scoping phase of building a plant, a gasoline plant in the basin that's going to be tapped into one of the pipelines that we are participant in. That plant will convert 35 million cubic feet a day of gas -- natural gas, lean gas into 3,000 barrels a day of gasoline. \n So that, I think, fits our model of, if we can contribute molecules and expertise to a project, not just capital, but the other things, to drive value. We're going to look at it. I would say that project might FID by the end of this year and be up and running in a couple of years, and that might be a good little offtake for 35 million a day of gas. And if it works, we're going to build more of them. Yes, Leo, a couple of things. I think we're having a pretty good end of the year last year into Q4, and so we pushed completions into Q1. So Q1 looks a little high relative I think generally you can think about that 70 to 80 overall completion a quarter as the base case. Q2 might be a little towards the high end there. But because we're a little bit ahead of plan in terms of efficiencies and timing we're probably going to reduce our frac crew count by 1 for a period of time over the summer as well as kind of get down into that 12, 13 rigs on the drilling side to complete -- to drill the same number of wells. So we look at the plan almost weekly with the planning team. And I think, generally, the efficiencies have led to less overall activity, more capital efficiency and setting us up well for this potential close here in Q4 with Endeavor. Yes. Not many. We sold a piece of our Viper ownership in the first quarter, and that plugged another $450 million of cash on the balance sheet. And I think I'll go back to when we structured this deal. We certainly do not want to put so much cash into the deal with Endeavor that we had to be a seller of assets, and that's exactly what we've done. Now I think we've had some price help here in the last couple of months that has boosted free cash flow and reduced the cash portion of the transaction. And listen, I think the price has got to be right for any asset sale, whether it's the Deep Blue, Viper or otherwise. And we're going to be patient post-close. I do think those assets make sense in other hands, but it's got to be the right value. Yes. It was just higher than that before then, a couple of quarters before that, and we had to work off the accruals. That number has been 7% for 10 years. We had a consultant that told us it was going to be higher last year, and that consultant is no longer working for us, but it's going to be 7% on an annual basis on average."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining again this morning. I hope you continue to find the stockholders' letter that we issued last night in an efficient way to communicate. We spend a lot of time putting that letter together, and there's a lot of material in that. So operator, with that as a brief introduction, would you please open the line for questions? Well, from a macro perspective, I think we've been pretty clear that we're going to continue to need pipes being built about every 12 to 18 months out of the Permian to accommodate the associated gas that goes along with just 6 million barrels a day that we produce out here. Natural gas is right now being almost like a waste product, and we've got it. This -- when matter workup zone this fall, we'll see some of that reverse. But Kaes, do you want to give them some description of what we're doing in the rest of the gas? Well, I think the deflationary pressures we continue to see in the Permian are being driven by the decline in the rig count and the decline in the completion crew count. Those will be tailwinds for us as we look through the rest of this year. But also without regards to those deflationary impacts, we continue to push the envelope on our D&C operations where we're getting -- I think we averaged almost 13,000 feet for the quarter this year, and we continue to get these wells drilled faster and then our completion crews continue to push the envelope on the number of lateral feet that are completed in a 24-hour period. So we're working on the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency and really like the way the rest of the year sets up for us. Roger, I give our guys some joke with them a little bit on the drilling side because they're almost to the point where they're spending more time screwing pipe together and unscreen pipe together than they are actual rotating hours and the lateral, not quite, but they keep certainly pushing the envelope. And really, if you go back to what we said during the acquisition announcement with the merger announcement with Endeavor, we talked about $150 a foot. $100 of that foot was from just simply going to a simul frac and the other $50 a foot was going to clear fluids. And really, that's what we're doing today. So we emphasized at the time. That's not a big stretch. It's just simply doing what we're doing today on a new set of assets. And in Dan's comments, we're spot on as well. Yes, John, we got to operate as separate companies until the deal closes, and those things will come to the benefits of the combined company, but certainly can't influence any outcomes until deals were closed. And Neal, as we built this company over the last 10 years, we've always maintained a couple of constants. One is the fact that we keep a real flat organization. And we keep a non-siloed organization as well too. And the only way that you can grow an organization and maintain that effectively is to have an unreasonable level of trust. And as we encourage our -- the Endeavor employees to come over, we're going to be demonstrating this high level of trust because it's going to be a very important part of our evolving culture as a much larger company. But those 2 things will stay the same, flat organization, no silos. Well, the first emphasis on AI has been not degenerative AI, but using AI to process data information a lot quicker. And so, look, we're really excited about the long-term implications of AI on our industry, whether that translates to improvements in AUR or improvements in efficiencies or hopefully both, I think, is yet to be determined. But it's one of those things that we're trying to be fast followers on. This is arena of our industry that's moving incredibly fast. These electric frac fleets that we're using right now actually are accumulating more information than we can process. So we're storing some of that information and hoping to use smart algorithms or AI to help us process that information in a more usable and more real-time fashion.  Kaes, this first question was the income-generating tech to offset that. Paul, when you look at the capital program, it's going to spend between $4 billion and $5 billion a year on a pro forma basis. The percent of that, that we're going to allocate to income-generating projects is probably pretty small and that in an individual sense, it will probably have a larger impact, but I wouldn't expect it to move up to the noticeable level on a company that's spending between $4 billion and $5 billion a year.
