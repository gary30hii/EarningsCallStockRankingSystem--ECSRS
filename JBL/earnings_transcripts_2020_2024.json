In these materials, you will find the earnings information that we cover during this conference call. Before handing the call over to Mike, I would now ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website beginning with our forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected first quarter net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you, Adam and good morning everyone. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Both segments executed extremely well and delivered financial results that came in well above the guidance we provided on June 19. The overperformance was driven mainly by two factors. First, during Q4, we experienced fewer corporate-related disruptions than we anticipated in June, which resulted in higher than expected throughput in our plans, a more efficient supply chain and lower corporate related expenses. And second, our teams in both segments quickly moved to capitalize on upside demand, mainly in the mobility, 5G wireless and cloud end-markets. The compounding effects of higher than expected sales, improved productivity and lower costs allowed us to deliver strong revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in Q4 well above our expectations in June. With that, I will now review our Q4 and fiscal \u201820 financial results. Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $197 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44. Core operating income during the quarter was $255 million, well above our expectations in June, driven mainly by the aforementioned higher sales and lower COVID-related impact that came in approximately $25 million lower than anticipated. Net interest expense during the quarter was $46 million. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.98, an 11% improvement over the prior quarter. For the full fiscal year, net revenue was $27.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. FY \u201820 GAAP operating income was $500 million, with GAAP net income of $54 million. GAAP net diluted earnings per share, was $0.35 for the year. Core operating income was $864 million, representing a core operating margin of 3.2%. Core diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.90. Now, turning to our fourth quarter and FY \u201820 segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $2.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. This growth was mainly due to our mobility and healthcare end markets. Core margins for the segment improved 60 basis points year-over-year to 3.5%. Revenue for our EMS segment increased by 8% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, driven mainly by the semi-cap, 5G wireless and cloud end-markets. Core margins for the segment were 3.5% during the quarter. For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $10.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year mainly due to our healthcare business. Core margins for the segment were 3.9%. Moving to EMS, in FY \u201820, revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to $16.6 billion as our value proposition continues to be well received in the areas of 5G wireless, cloud and semi cap. Core margins for the segment were 2.7%. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q4, inventory days came in better than expected at 56 days, a decline of 11 days sequentially. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $241 million and for the full fiscal year came in as expected at $796 million. Our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong coming in at $687 million. As a result, the strong fourth quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $461 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.7x and cash balances of $1.4 billion. To further strengthen our balance sheet during Q4, we issued a $600 million 3% senior note maturing in January of 2031. We used the proceeds to redeem our $400 million 5.625% senior notes due in December 2020. We ended Q4 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity along with our quarter end cash balance, Jabil ended Q4 with access to more than $5.2 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility to navigate the current market environment. During Q4, we repurchased approximately 760,000 shares for $25 million bringing our total year-to-date repurchases to $215 million. In closing, I am very pleased with our strong execution and resiliency in a challenging environment and are encouraged by the positive momentum we carry into fiscal \u201821. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I will begin by offering my sincere gratitude to all of you here at Jabil. Thanks for hanging in there during these trying times, while never compromising the safety of our people. Your response, stamina and attitude had been amazing and so appreciated. Again, thank you all. Today is our third consecutive year, where we not only share our results and give a quarterly guide, but we also provide a complete outlook for the year ahead. So, I will get us started with thoughts on our outlook and Mike will offer additional detail during his follow-on remarks. Moving to Slide 11, I will offer a few thoughts on our approach beginning with diversity and inclusion. Being that Jabil is a service business, we know that each employee is critical to our success. We also know that each employee has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, all day and everyday. We operate our business in 30 plus countries, employing people that don\u2019t look the same, don\u2019t talk the same, people that practice different religions have different sexual orientations, people with physical limitations and neuro diversities. Diversity and inclusion is top of mind as we employ folks all around the world, but we have got more work to do. We won\u2019t abide racism for lack of human rights. We won\u2019t accept discrimination for social injustice. Our team challenges the status quo and we hold ourselves accountable through action. Most recently, we formed a 9-person council to assist and guide our internal D&I efforts. This council will provide advocacy as we push to improve our own shortcomings. These 9-council leaders are talented and without a doubt will make us better. Consistent with this focus, we are pleased to be a premium sponsor for the upcoming Special Olympics U.S. games. The sponsorship has evolved into a partnership granting our employees the remarkable opportunity to engage with the athletes and their coaches. This will also make us better. In summary, our team continues to safeguard our work environment and ensure that everyone can be their true self without fear or anxiety, without harm or recourse and with full acceptance of our individual differences. The second aspect of our approach pertains to ESG and sustainability, a table we aim to always do what\u2019s right. This includes doing right by our planet and doing right in helping others. We will expand our use of clean energy as we strive to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% within the next 5 to 6 years. Equally important is the pursuit of our sustainability goals as influenced by the United Nations\u2019 decade of action. We are determined to lead our industry by attaining highest standards in the areas of employee safety, water usage, hazardous waste and supply chain management. Also, we understand what gets measured gets done. So we have applied this mantra to our people and their incredible generosity, which allows us to quantify their contributions as they volunteer their personal time. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 13. This slide paints a terrific picture underscoring the effectiveness of our team and the strength of our commercial portfolio. What you see is two segments, where one plus one equals three. Two segments that complement one another both in terms of in markets and capabilities, relevant capabilities that when properly combined, fuel our services and our solutions. Two segments that, when placed side by side, suggest resiliency at scale. So, let\u2019s break down each segment. Please flip to Slide 14. Roughly 50% of our DMS segment is comprised of Jabil businesses that operate in a regulated type environment, businesses such as healthcare and automotive. These end markets share similar certification and validation requirements and must meet certain standards as they bring products to market. At the same time, capital investments align with the longer, more stable product lifecycles. The other half of our DMS segment is also comprised of two divisions, our connected devices and mobility divisions. These divisions excel at high volume production, advanced material sciences, aesthetically complex molding, precision mechanics and flexible automation. We are excited about the balanced portfolio within our DMS segment with a focus on expanding margins while offering reliable cash flows. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 15, where I will share a few thoughts on our EMS segment. Jabil\u2019s ability to combine years of manufacturing know-how and process standards with data analytics set us apart. Our longstanding customers leverage Jabil\u2019s unique IT network as we manage all types of sophisticated global supply chains. Today, we serve a wonderful blend of markets across our EMS segment, markets that include 5G and cloud, industrial and semi-cap, digital print and retail, networking and storage. We are excited about the broad range of customers in our EMS segment with a focus on growing cash flows while offering stable margins. Putting this all together, let\u2019s look at our outlook on Slide 16. For fiscal \u201821, we plan to deliver a core operating margin of 4% on revenues of $26.5 billion. This mirrors what we committed to you 1 year ago. It\u2019s important to note that the 4% operating margin on the $26 billion correlates to $4 in core EPS, again, marrying what we said last September. Three primary actions give us confidence in our outlook: one, the improved makeup of our commercial portfolio; two, reduce levels of overhead; and three, lower cost associated with COVID. These three actions sum to roughly $180 million to $190 million of additional income year-on-year, FY \u201820 to FY \u201821. If I step back and think about where we are at today, much of our success here at Jabil is because we placed the needs of the customer first and we do so through non-parochial sharing of all resources and all capabilities. I think about this sharing as frictionless collaboration. When this collaboration is combined with the experience and actions of our team, you have a winning recipe, a recipe which delivers optimized solutions and services to our customers. I ask that you now please turn to Slide 18. In closing, our outlook for fiscal \u201821 is indicative of the positive momentum we are carrying into the year. It\u2019s an outlook that\u2019s grounded by the continuation of our straightforward strategy, a strategy built on five basic pillars ensuring our business mix remains well diversified, obsessing over our customers, while leading with engineering, driving growth through sharing and integrating our capabilities, expanding margins by contouring our portfolio, and leveraging our varied end markets to deliver reliable cash flows. Lastly, to our entire leadership team, once again, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. Most importantly, thank you for being your true self. As CEO, I am honored to serve you year-in and year-out. I will now turn the call back over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks Mark. I would also like to thank our employees for their hard work, dedication and excellent execution during the challenging FY \u201820. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide you with a framework that highlights how we will execute on our strategy and deliver on our financial commitments in the coming year. As we turn our focus to 2021, our financial priorities remain unchanged. First, we are fully focused on expanding margins. To position the company to deliver higher margins over the last few years, we have targeted growth in areas of our business, that have higher return profiles that offer accretive margins and strong cash flow streams. At the same time, we are focused on optimizing costs to ensure we deliver SG&A leverage across the worldwide Jabil footprint. Secondly, in FY \u201821, we are forecasting core earnings per share to improve nearly 40% over FY \u201820. And finally, we are focused on generating strong free cash flow through optimization of working capital and disciplined CapEx management. Next, let\u2019s take a look at each of our operating segments and I would like to walk you through what we are seeing in the different end markets we serve and how each of these plays a role in delivering our financial targets. Our DMS team\u2019s strong performance over the last few years reflects our improving business mix as a result of our intense focus on diversifying our end-markets, products and customers to create a more sustainable business. The team continues to do a tremendous job leveraging our deep capabilities in this segment like tooling, precision mechanics, acoustics, optics, automation, and material sciences to capture new opportunities in high value adjacent markets. Nowhere is as clearer than in our healthcare and packaging businesses, which have grown tremendously over the last few years through several key wins, including a transformational strategic healthcare collaboration. Today, we are one of the largest healthcare manufacturing solutions companies in the world and we are well positioned to capture future similar opportunities. In packaging, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the convergence of electronics and smart and eco-friendly packaging. As we move to automotive, the bulk of our business focuses on electrification of auto based on a nearly 10-year relationship with the leading electric automotive company in the world. In the near-term, this market is recovering faster than we expected just a few months ago. Looking forward, we remain well-positioned as demand for increased safety, governmental mission regulations and the race towards electrification and autonomous vehicles are all playing a significant role in shaping the future of driving as we know it. Moving to connected devices, as more people worked and learned from home, we saw good demand for products, such as tablets, headphones and smart watches in FY \u201820. As we move forward into FY \u201821, we expect this dynamic to remain. Beyond these devices, we are also continuing to shape the portfolio with products that meet our margin and cash flow profiles. Consequently, this will result in lower revenue for FY \u201821. Beyond FY \u201821, we believe the adoption of 5G will provide a further catalyst for future growth. And finally, within mobility, we remain extremely well-positioned across all models and components as we continue to benefit from our diversification strategy. The out-of-season launch continues to perform extremely well. In tandem with this, the upcoming next generation launch which began in Q4 is going extremely well. Our team\u2019s technical expertise and focus on operational efficiencies continues to contribute to a very strong customer relationship. In summary, for DMS to me, the key takeaway this year is the considerable mix shift underway. In FY \u201821, healthcare and packaging is expected to be more than a third of our DMS business, with estimated revenue growth of approximately $600 million in FY \u201821. Putting it all together for DMS in FY \u201821, we are expecting an impressive 80 basis points of margin expansion on mid to high single-digit revenue growth. Turning now to EMS, the trends in technologies disrupting the IT industry today are numerous and accelerating at a rate never seen before. The interplay between a dramatic increase in bandwidth brought about by 5G and the ever-growing power of computing in the cloud is creating a technology and business ecosystem that is changing at faster rates than earlier generations. All of this is happening in the context of increased consumption of silicon chips, unprecedented change in the retail landscape, additive manufacturing and software-driven architectures. In digital print and retail, we continue to expect softness during the first half of FY \u201821 driven by office and retail closures. However, longer term we are well-positioned in these end-markets as we partner with our customers to bring next generation print and retail technologies to market. Shifting gears to industrial, demand has been relatively consistent to-date, but moving forward, we are seeing signs that new building starts are being delayed, which could have an impact on demand in the first half of our fiscal year. However, in the medium to longer term, we are well positioned to take advantage of favorable macro tailwinds through capturing growth in the smart metering, power conversion and energy storage spaces. In semi-cap during the slowdown, the team did an excellent job of aggressively managing our costs while capturing market share and diversifying our business across both the front-end and back-end. With the ongoing recovery in the space, our efforts over the last 18 months are manifesting in stronger results. We are seeing solid demand and so far customers continue to march ahead with new fab plant investments, executing to their 2020 and 2021 roadmaps. In cloud, our unique offering continues to resonate with the hyperscalers, evidenced by the significant growth over the last 3 years. And this growth has only accelerated in the near-term as work and learn from home has significantly increased the demand for cloud infrastructure. Our customers are looking for much more flexibility in their server and storage hardware supply chains, while greatly reducing their cycle times. The message that is resonating with our customers is our design to dust capability to provide a consistent experience across capabilities, functions and geographies. Keep in mind that when we talk about our design to dust value prop, we can design, create, make and recycle all within the same four walls, which is incredibly powerful as security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our customers. Coupled with our vertical integration strategy, this level of engagement creates very sticky relationships with our customers. It\u2019s worth reminding everyone our cloud business is a bit unique and has been deliberately structured as a geocentric asset-light service offering. With this in mind in FY \u201821, approximately $1 billion in components we procure and integrate will shift from the current purchase and resale model to a consignment service model. We will benefit from higher margins and lower cash use in this business as a result of the transition, which will further bolster the asset light nature of our offering. Another area undergoing rapid disruption is the 5G wireless end market. Over the last several years, we have invested in accelerated NPI, test processes and R&D, increasing our stickiness with customers and so maintaining our leadership role in the manufacture of base stations and radios as we transition to a 5G world. We continue to see growth in 5G offset by legacy wireless as the market transitions to newer technology. In FY \u201821, we expect 5G infrastructure rollouts to continue as network operators upgrade their services. And then finally, within the legacy networking and storage end markets, we expect consistent networking demand, but reduced storage demand driven by cautious overall enterprise spend and the ongoing shift to the cloud. In FY \u201821, this demand dynamic coupled with our decision not to pursue other products that do not meet our margin and cash flow profiles will result in lower revenue. Following 3 years of tremendous growth as part of our diversification efforts, we expect EMS revenues to be down year-over-year, mainly due to the consignment shift within our cloud business and lower networking and storage revenue. With the current mix of business in EMS, we expect a healthy 80 basis points of core margin expansion in fiscal \u201821. Turning to the next slide, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to expand overall core margins through cost optimization and targeted growth. We also anticipate a COVID related negative impact of approximately $30 million to $50 million for the year, significantly less than FY \u201820 due to fewer COVID related disruptions in our plants and the supply chain, along with lower PP&E costs. As a result at an enterprise level, we are well-positioned to deliver 4% in core margins for FY \u201821. Turning now to our CapEx guidance for FY \u201821, net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800 million consistent with FY \u201820. This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth. Let\u2019s talk about our maintenance CapEx for a moment. We now have over 100 sites in 31 countries. At this scale, our factories require approximately $550 million in annual maintenance investments. This is inclusive of investments in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization, which will drive optimization across our footprint and position us to deliver higher profitability. We are also investing in strategic growth in targeted areas of our business that are expected to deliver strong margin expansion and free cash flow. The bulk of our strategic growth CapEx will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, semi-cap and packaging end markets. Turning now to free cash flow, in FY \u201821, we intend to continue generating strong cash flows as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team\u2019s ability to execute and efficiently manage working capital. Working capital improvements will come mainly through improved inventory levels. These factors, coupled with our disciplined CapEx, gives me confidence in our ability to deliver adjusted free cash flows of more than $600 million in FY \u201821. Turning now to our capital allocation framework, our capital return framework beyond organic investments will prioritize the commitment to our dividend, share repurchases and a combination of targeted M&A, and optimizing our capital structure. We are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows, which will allow us to continue to return capital to shareholders, maintain investment grade ratings and ensure we maintain an optimal capital structure. Turning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase by 1% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to decrease 15% on a year-over-year basis to $3.2 billion. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.3 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $295 million to $335 million, with core operating margin in the range of 4.4% to 4.6%. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $238 million to $283 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.35. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $1.02. The tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter is estimated to be in the range of 26% to 28%. As we transition to our final slide, you can really begin to see the earnings power of a diversified and balanced Jabil. Today, our business serves a diverse plan of end-markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4% in core margins in FY \u201821 along with $4 in core EPS and more than $600 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. I would like to thank you for your time today and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call back over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks Mike. As we begin our Q&A session, I would like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we will not address customer or product specific questions. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning and congrats on a strong finish to fiscal \u201820. Mark, I just wanted to start on COVID cost, it was I think you said $25 million lower than expected in the quarter. So I think in the quarter, a little under $10 million a month. Thinking about where you sit here towards the end of September, is that still getting better? I am just trying to understand how much you have to go to get to this $30 to $50 million that you talked about for the full year in fiscal \u201821? And secondly, just to clarify is the $50 million or so restructuring program the reason that this came down or is that separate and on top of this, I just want to make sure I am not double counting?\nMark Mondello: Hi, Adam. Thanks for the nice comment. I will let Mike talk about the restructuring and maybe let\u2019s get it clarify that a little bit. In terms of COVID, geez, I am really happy with how we handled it all in a really, really kind of opaque, murky deal. I mean, we take you back to February, things are blowing up. I think our COVID costs in February on a total monthly basis were like $55 million, $60 million for the month then we moved into Q3 and COVID costs were around $50 million and then Q4. As we are sitting in the June call, I think either Mike or I said Q4 would be around $40 million, $50 million. And as we got into 4Q, June was still kind of along that run-rate that has started to dissipate a bit in July and in a more normalized run-rate when compared to FY \u201821 as we are leaving August and as we continue to index through September, our run-rate in September looks to be much like August. So, assuming that the whole world doesn\u2019t blow up again, at that point, all bets are off, but with everything kind of the way we see it, we feel pretty confident in the 30% to 50%, I think a way to think about those costs are maybe 60%, 65% in the first half of the year and something like 35% to 40% in the back half of the year. And with that, maybe you could expand a little bit on the restructuring question. I will let Mike address that.\nAdam Tindle: Yes, I was just trying to understand what the restructuring, is that what is helping the COVID costs to get better or is the restructuring program on top of this and going to help in Q1,\nMike Dastoor: The restructuring effort is on top of that nothing to do with the COVID reduction at all, Adam?\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, I wanted to understand from a seasonality perspective as we think about fiscal \u201821. It\u2019s just a little bit unusual based on your Q1 guidance to see revenue down sequentially in November quarter for Jabil. So, maybe you could touch on why that\u2019s occurring is that \u2013 is the full move to the consignment shift in Q1 and what it means for the out quarters and also the cadence of margin as that occurs? It looks like you are starting at such a high point about mid 4% range in Q1, but the full year is guided to around 4% just trying to understand the cadence of the drop-off in margins as well? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: Yes. So there is a couple of things in that. One is if I take a look at kind of our DMS business, I think kind of year-on-year Q1 \u201820 to \u201821 in the range of around 1%, so on the DMS Q1 to Q1. And I would think about our DMS business, Adam, more kind of first half to first half just based on timing of some products. So, if I take a look at and I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t know the exact numbers, but rough numbers would be kind of DMS, first half, first half of \u201820 to first half of \u201821, we will probably see growth in the 6% to 8% range. And then I think if you look at the blue green slide overall for the year, DMS, so will be up about $800 million from call it 13, 13.2 up to around 14. So, I wouldn\u2019t get too caught up in the Q1 revenue numbers. And then overall for the enterprise, if we execute well in Q1, like Mike said in his prepared remarks, we expect margins to be around the 4.5% range. With that same execution kind of total comparison, we could have a six handle on our margins for DMS in Q1. So, off to a relatively strong start which is typically how our years kick off. And I would say as I think about kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, if I am thinking about shaping the year, at an enterprise level, margins should be pretty stable. So, if we kick off with a 4.5%, I think Q4, we could end somewhere around 4% and then Q2, Q3 in between in the high 3s something like that and if you sum all that up kind of on a weighted average basis, EMS to DMS, we are shooting for 4% overall for the enterprise for \u201821.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong guide and the $4 target for fiscal \u201821, which is pretty much what you had guided in fiscal 4Q \u201919, so that says \u2013 congrats on the guide. Just my first question, conceptually, I am wondering why add automotive and transport into DMS, so just your thoughts on why that segment was added into the DMS segment?\nMike Dastoor: I think it\u2019s because every couple of years Ruplu, we have been on, I don\u2019t know a 5 \u2013 4, 5, 6-year journey. And we disengaged with BlackBerry back in the day. We sold our services business. We are really successful with in the mobility sector. And we have been working really, really hard to continue to diversify the portfolio. I don\u2019t think that work is ever done, but where we sit today, if you just kind of sit back and look at the \u2013 for lack of better word, the portfolio slide on the blue and the green, geez, we have got, 8 areas of our business reflected there and I just love the way it looks. I said something like that in my prepared remarks. As part of kind of always reshaping there, I think I use the word contouring the portfolio we would like to have businesses together that makes sense from a capability perspective and market perspective. And we just felt like automotive and transport fits really well with our healthcare business in terms of overall regulated markets. And then the other shift we made and again, I know this can be aggravating to investors, because it ends up being a lot to follow. That\u2019s not our intention. Our intention is to give us a good platform again for the next 24 to 36 months. We took our smart home business, which had been in our networking storage, because a lot of devices in home were networked together and we moved some of that over to connected devices just because of 5G coming on board. And when we think about things throughout the home, from a capabilities and an end-market perspective, it fit really well into connected devices. The good news is those modest shifts don\u2019t change the enterprise level numbers, but that\u2019s the logic behind it.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks. Thanks for the clarification on that. Mike and for my follow-up just on the EMS segment, just looking at industrial and semi-cap, you are guiding year-on-year flat at $3.5 billion. That just seems a little conservative given industrial end market should improve next year. And I assume semi-cap is not a target revenue or margins it should be improving. So, just your thoughts on what are the puts and takes in that segment, why are you guiding flat revenues year-on-year?\nMark Mondello: I don\u2019t want to get into all the puts and takes only because Ruplu our industrial business has all kinds of puts and takes. I would say, I\u2019d \u2013 if I were to knowing that we are not going to be right on any of these numbers exactly, if I had to handicap industrial and semi-cap, I would say I agree with your comments. If there is, if we are going to handicap that one way or the other sitting here today for the year, there is probably more upside than not, I would say certainly in \u2013 certainly in semi-cap and that\u2019s offset by some softness at the moment in industrial and I think Mike talked in his prepared remarks about construction starts both residential and commercial we think will soften a bit, certainly through the first half of the year and then regain some momentum towards the back half of the year, but I think you are thinking about that the right way.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks for taking my questions and congrats again on the strong guide. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nJim Suva: Thanks. Could you spend a little bit of time talking about the shift to consignment model and not that there is anything wrong with doing that, but was it \u2013 is it across all your customers or particular customer driving that and is it all completed in calendar \u2013 I am sorry fiscal Q1 and the revenue impact, because I believe it would be a revenue comes out of the model four? And then I am just wondering does it impact seasonality going forward?\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim. Sure. So, I think it\u2019s really important for everybody to understand that our move to consignment wasn\u2019t reactionary it wasn\u2019t something that we just thought of. If you go back and I don\u2019t remember when we first started talking about our cloud business, it was 4, 5, 6 earnings calls ago. I remember at that point in time, we gave it enough attention we were doing the JJMD deal and we also in one of those calls, we had two separate slides, one talking about our JJMD engagement in collaboration, which by the way is going very well and then we had a slide on cloud. There is a lot of questions at that time about are we getting into white box manufacturing in this set and the other and we have been very, very consistent in our approach strategically the cloud business that we are going to go into this in the geocentric service model, it was going to be a very asset-light very agile model both on the fixed asset and networking capital side as that business is scaled through, call it back half of \u201819 all through \u201820, we have always had a thought process in terms of again keeping the networking capital asset-light as well. So this has been in the works for quite some time. And I would say the consignment model that we have went through is largely around our cloud business and it\u2019s largely in place. So, again, if you look at the shape of our EMS business, I think our guide for Q1 per Mike\u2019s comments in the press release is like $3.2 billion for EMS. You compare that to a $3.7 billion, Q1 \u201820 to Q1 \u201821, that\u2019s just reflective, largely around consignment. And then we also have some intentional reshaping of our networking storage business on top of that, but I would say, you can consider it in place and it will be reflective quarter-to-quarter throughout the year.\nJim Suva: Got it. So, you said effectively in place in Q1 so that would mean the revenue impact is pretty much all absorbed in Q1 and going beyond Q1, it sounds like revenue seasonality should be closer to normal, because it seems like Q1 would be hindered a little bit because of the shift to consignment model if I understand consignment correctly, where you won\u2019t recognize the revenue, you are just going to pass that through?\nMark Mondello: I want to be careful that I understand your comment, because this is kind of an important topic. The $3.2 billion saying it straight up right, the $3.2 billion guide for EMS in Q1 is fully reflective of the consignment model. So there is no \u2013 there is no jeez, we are going to come back and go, the $3.2 billion turned into $2.5 billion because of consignment, it\u2019s all in. So, again if you take that new and you take a look at our Q1 \u201821 relative to our Q1 \u201820 EMS, I think you will see the distinction there Q1 \u201820 in EMS was around $3.7 billion, something like that, Q1 of \u201821 is $3.2 billion. So again, it\u2019s fully reflected. In addition to that, Jim, I believe that the blue green slides that we shared I spoke to it a bit, Mike went a bit deeper shows our overall company revenue for the year around $26.5 billion. The EMS segment, which is where our cloud business sits, show shows $12.5 billion. So again, overall for the company for the year $26.5 billion midpoint, about $14 billion of that is our DMS segment $12.5 billion is our EMS segment. That\u2019s where our cloud business sits. Those numbers also are fully reflective of any and all consignment.\nJim Suva: Got it. Thanks so much. And my last follow-up is with the U.S. being a political entity list of can\u2019t build to, can\u2019t ship to things like that, is any of that impacting your company and how should we think about that?\nMark Mondello: Well, we talked about that last year. That was a hot topic as we were coming out of \u201819 into \u201820 and COVID kind of dominated everything. But that\u2019s something we watch every week, every month. And I think we had talked about the fact that the first half of \u201819, I may have \u2013 I maybe off the quarter to Jim, but directionally as we exited fiscal \u201819 going into first half of \u201820, somewhere in that timeframe, when the tariff talks were hot and heavy and relatively new in front of headlines, we had said we were going to have a two to three quarter portion of our business, where we were going to spend upwards of $20 million, $25 million in terms of moving product around for customers. At that point in time, we have suggested that if the macro holds or even weakens a little bit, all of this product needs to get built. And I can\u2019t think of a better place for customers to build it than at Jabil just because of our global footprint. So, we can continue to keep an eye on that. As mentioned previously that if we kind of collate up all of our business in Mainland China as we sit today and I have said this in the past, there are certain parts of that business that we just don\u2019t think will move based on the indigenous supply chain and other factors. We have also said that there is a significant amount of our China revenue today that China for other parts of the world, non-U.S. and then the China revenue that we have that happens to be products to be consumed and shipped to the U.S. Some of that has already shifted and some of it customers look at it and they are comfortable keeping it in China for now.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and clarification. It\u2019s greatly appreciated.\nMark Mondello: Yes, thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about as you not to put the cart before the horse and actually hitting $4. But you have been messaging that, that wasn\u2019t a major top line driver to getting to $4 over the last couple of years, it was more about improving margins on the different new programs you win \u2013 what have won. So, can you just talk about how much of that is still holding true? And then as you transition through those new programs, what is the messaging to the go-to-market teams beyond this year? Is it to return to growth leverage more internally, etcetera? And then I had a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: Okay. Well, there is couple questions in there and I appreciate you not putting the cart before the horse, although I think we have kind of asked for it, because we came out with the four and the four. So, we got a lot of work to do to deliver the four and the four, but we wouldn\u2019t have put it out there, if we didn\u2019t see a clear path. Yes. For the last 3, 4 years, we have been talking about diversifying the top line, but at the same time, we have been caveating those comments with the fact that we are not going to chase revenue for the sake of chasing revenue. We are going to diversify income and cash flows, which is exactly what I think we have been up to. And I would suggest our team has been quite successful in that. If I think about FY \u201821, we are certainly not chasing revenue because on an absolute basis, some of this is consignment, revenues going down, but again, I would say overall, it is about us kind of continually taking a file and not a chisel and filing the portfolio with a real kind of no kidding focus on the margins in the cash flows. So, that\u2019s what we are up to and we are going to work really hard to do our best to deliver that the four and the four.\nSteven Fox: Thanks for that. And then just as a quick follow-up, I understand the accounting math behind the consignment shift, but what does it mean in terms of your ability to drive better engagements with those cloud customers? Is that a competitive advantage? Is it something everyone is doing or what would you say that means in sort of at the customer level for this shift?\nMark Mondello: I would say it\u2019s neutral. That one aspect is neutral. It\u2019s \u2013 there is in our geocentric asset-light service business there is high dollar components, where we don\u2019t provide much value. And so having those pass-through materials is distortive to the real returns we should be getting on the value add we provide the customer. I would say our cloud business is founded on the services our team provides the geocentric nature of it, the flexibility, the agility, I mean, I think about COVID was unplanned and COVID hits and all of a sudden, people are working remotely working from homes and the ability of our of our cloud team to react all by the way as well as our mobility team and our connected devices team. I mean, those volumes spiked up. So, I would say it\u2019s the most important part of our approach to that model is \u2013 or that businesses is the model itself and the relationships that we have, Steve.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And good luck in game four.\nMark Mondello: Yes, we will need it. It was a good win by lightning last night. So thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning and thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. The first question was just following up on what Steven was just talking about in the cloud business and the company has been driving some very nice growth in cloud, I think one customer in particular has been good, but Jabil has talked about having a handful of customers in cloud and some opportunities to grow. Obviously, that\u2019s a market that should exhibit growth, but grow as Jabil becomes bigger within the cloud markets. You have done a little bit more what sort of opportunity Jabil sees either in FY \u201821 or longer term to continue to take share within the cloud business?\nMark Mondello: Mark, I really appreciate the question. I am not trying to duck the question. But we are in the process now of varying conversations going on with current customers, hyperscale customers, smaller customers. So, I just \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get into it on a customer by customer basis. I think what we have said in the past is we have got reasonably good confidence in our approach to what we are doing in that market overall and we certainly expect that market to be kind of multi-customer faceted if you will and that\u2019s still our path and still our intent.\nMark Delaney: Okay, that\u2019s helpful and understand the sensitivities. One other question I wanted to understand I think is on the mind of one investors who I speak to is thinking through some of the cyclical dynamics and the risks that either because some of the geopolitical tensions with China or just with COVID supply chain uncertainties, there has potentially been pre-buying taking place that in uncertain end markets, you talked about how Jabil is thinking about that risk and what you may have factored in as you were contemplating your 2021 outlook?\nMark Mondello: Which risk in particular?\nMark Delaney: Well, I think in a few areas, one is to the extent you are hoping there is any customers in China and they are worried about some of this geopolitical tension have they pulled in, but even, just more broadly with, there has been some uncertainties around, what ability has the supply chain been able to serve as customers and if customers worried about, companies not being able to manufacture or maybe they are pre-building products, because they just didn\u2019t know how COVID may impact just the overall supply chain. So, had they maybe built \u2013 pulled in any of their plans, so just high level to the extent you have seen for either COVID or geopolitical reasons, customers building more than maybe they otherwise would have? Do you think you have seen any of that or did you try and think about that risk at all when you are contemplating your 2021 outlook?\nMark Mondello: Okay, I understand the question and it\u2019s appreciated. I would say, if I am sitting on your side of the table, along with kind of the buy side folks, it\u2019s immaterial. I will give you an example. And I am not suggesting that there is not pockets that are material, but in the big picture of what we just guided to our outlook for Q1 and then certainly for \u201821, I think all those puts and takes there is a lot of them, I think they are immaterial. I give you an example. There has certainly been on Steve Borges\u2019 business with healthcare, there has certainly been some upside near-term upside in healthcare through the back half of \u201820 and probably the first quarter or two in \u201821 demand driven solely by COVID. Yes, there has been a falloff in his business due to COVID with elective surgeries as an example. Yet you spin all that up and you kind of get kind of a normalized business plan and same holds true with some puts and takes industrials, same holds true with some puts and takes in connected devices, although that ended up being a net strength. So, I would say all in all, we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but our Q1 guide and our overall outlook for the year, Mark, we have taken kind of all those puts and takes, we have stress tested it with all the teams and we feel like we have kind of normalized it to the 4%, the $4 and $26.5 billion in revenue.\nMark Delaney: Understood. Thank you very much.\nMark Mondello: Yes, you are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Our next question today is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live. Hello, Matt, perhaps your phone is on mute. Matt, if you can hear me, I cannot hear you. Please return to the queue by pressing star one. Our next question today is coming from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. You line is now live.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I had more of a big picture question as you look forward over the next few years. You talked about the investment that you are making in terms of CapEx and maintenance in that within your facilities. But I am curious, what kind of drivers do you see really improving productivity and providing more of a margin either to you or to your customers from a technology perspective within your factories and sort of how do you see the I don\u2019t know the factory of the future in the next few years? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Okay, Shannon, that\u2019s a cool question. That\u2019s kind of what we are all about. We are a company at the core that builds stuff. And so we are, if I think Mike, when you talked about CapEx in his prepared remarks talked about a split between growth and maintenance, I would say in terms of productivity in the factories, that\u2019s probably split between maintenance and growth. I would say, we are one of the leading companies that I know of in terms of automation what I would call flexible automation, what I would call automated, real useful automated platforms, you combine that with augmented reality, that will start hitting our factory floors, you combine that with machine learning. And then the other thing I think that sets Jabil apart is as you take all of that, Shannon, we have got a ton of factories, call it, we run our \u2013 we largely run most of our business on 35, 40 sites, although we have more. If I take those \u2013 if I take the sites that are most impactful to our earnings, they are all wrapped together in a single holistic IT system and I don\u2019t know that anyone else has that. So, we will always continue to invest and invest aggressively in terms of the technology the productivity that you alluded to. I think what shareholders should hold us accountable for is with those investments and with the aggression around that type of investing I would hold us accountable for continued margin expansion and good cash flows. If I think about the journey we have been on, on top line diversification, where we have been going through that, our margins for 2, 3 years have been stuck around 3.5%. We are starting to see the efforts come through on the margin line. That\u2019s why we \u2013 that\u2019s why Q1 is looking at 4.5% and the year around 4%. So, I think the returns we are getting on those investments are coming through in terms of our bottom line.\nShannon Cross: Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then can you talk \u2013 you talked about strength in healthcare, but maybe if you could be a bit more specific, I know obviously, there was pressure from electives not happening and benefit from COVID in the near-term. But what other key drivers maybe you can talk about the Johnson & Johnson relationship are benefiting healthcare? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Well, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 the \u2013 I look at the J&J collaboration and that\u2019s kind of business as usual now. We spoke about that for a number of calls. That partnership that the team that\u2019s responsible for that, that has gotten so deep and boy has that turned out, I think from both sides, we had high expectations. I think it\u2019s turning out better than even we expected and I hope J&J would feel the same, but that the business is so far beyond that. I mean, I think we are talking about healthcare and packaging combined, bumping up towards $5 billion. I think about that business, Shannon. I always have my timing a little bit off, but it\u2019s typically directionally correct. Our healthcare and packaging business in FY late \u201817, early \u201818, was like a $2 billion business, then it started bumping up against $2.5 billion. FY \u201819 healthcare and packaging, was probably closer to $3 billion. Last year, it was closer to $4 billion. And now we are bumping up against $5 billion. And again, as pleased as we are with the Johnson & Johnson collaboration, it\u2019s just it\u2019s a lot more than that. Steve and his team are focused in areas so broad-based today relative to 4 years ago with things like pharma, the med device, orthopedics, diagnostics, etcetera. And then I think they will also start to gravitate towards digital analytics and digital diagnosis as well. And then you add to it, I am very, very excited about what the next couple of years hold for our consumer packaging business as well. So, that line item when you look at it on the green blue slide, again, this is a little bit of a commentary around the whole company, but the healthcare packaging line is as diverse both end market and customer base as it\u2019s ever been.\nShannon Cross: Great, thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Shannon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Coster: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Obviously, lot to like here. I was particularly impressed by the statement of intent around diversity and inclusion. So that was welcome. Couple of quick things. One is you sounded, Mike, like you intentionally called some business in DMS segment, I think I heard that correct, what was the criteria for doing so, what impact does that have in terms of the year-on-year sort of base percentage growth or headwind, I suppose in 2021?\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Paul. Thanks for the question. We did call some we are constantly reshaping the portfolio as we see it right now on the networking and storage side, in particular. We have been looking at all businesses we have. I think we have declared a couple of years ago that we are focusing on margins. We are focusing on free cash flow. And we are tightening up all our financial metrics around existing and future customers. So, that\u2019s one of the areas that we have looked at, in particular. I talked about connected devices as well in my prepared remarks. That\u2019s another one where we have gone and called some customers there. So, it\u2019s all directional. We have said we will do that. We will focus on that. And that is exactly what we are doing.\nPaul Coster: And can you quantify in terms of headwinds on the \u2013 for that segment year-on-year?\nMike Dastoor: Yes, if you look at the blue and green slide, I will just highlight the networking and storage, that\u2019s the last line on the blue side, that\u2019s down by about $600 million. A lot of that is a simple straightforward, hey, let\u2019s get this to our financial metric levels and then you have connected devices on the green side as well. That\u2019s the \u2013 there is parts of business that are doing really well on the connected devices and then there is parts that we feel the financial metrics don\u2019t just justify moving ahead with them.\nPaul Coster: Okay, got it. I think Mark, you mentioned that you are starting to see sort of green shoots in the auto space, especially with electrification, which is good, but it\u2019s really confusing monitoring that space at the moment. The big Tier 1s all seemed poised, but not active and instead just seeing a lot of small companies, kind of sneaking into the space at the moment and that seems to be where most of the action is and they are focused on sort of niche markets that seemed to have the best playback perhaps on electrification. Do you concur that that\u2019s the kind of business that you are seeing now or are you actually starting to see the beginnings of the passenger vehicle market kicking into your business?\nMark Mondello: What I would concur is it is confusing from the outside in, it\u2019s an interesting market. I think, I don\u2019t want to generalize, but a portion of the automotive market is starting to be just a big rolling mobile device and that\u2019s a really good spot for us and that\u2019s where we are focused most of our attention. We do support legacy automotive technology. But as we continue to look forward, a lot of our attention will be again, if you just think of the automotive industry in the next 10 years being a connected device on four wheels. That\u2019s kind of how we look at it and that\u2019s where we are making most of our investments.\nPaul Coster: Do you think that the inflection point there is in a couple of years still, I mean, that\u2019s the impression I get is 2022, 2023 that the action really starts to heat up?\nMark Mondello: I would say that\u2019s probably best case. Yes, we are thinking somewhere I would say volumes and whatnot start to heat up call it 2025, something like that, but there is a lot of work. There is a lot of work that goes in between now and then. So, we will be busy.\nPaul Coster: Alright. Thank you. Appreciate that.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Paul. Yes.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. So, I did want to thank you for all the details so far, Mark and Mike. One follow-up question regarding your guidance for the storage and networking segment, I understand that you are reshaping at walking away from some programs that are not profitable or don\u2019t give you returns goals. But could you talk about how you see those end-markets playing out particularly storage, it sounds like you are looking at your further weakness there because of the move to the cloud? And then beyond that, we are seeing not as stable, but some of your peers also walking away from some of these programs in the data hub space, where they are not needing certain metrics and goals. And at some point, it looks like the leverage might swing back to the EMS guys like you \u2013 where you make win deals, because customers really have nowhere to go.\nMark Mondello: Yes, I don\u2019t know, I look at it quite simply as I want, I don\u2019t ever \u2013 I don\u2019t want ever want to walk away from a relationship. But there are certain relationships where if we get to a point that customers can provide, others than Jabil business and get better value-add for it, then so be it. And I think in the network storage space, it\u2019s been a market that we have played in actively since the early 90s. We have got some longstanding relationships that are, I don\u2019t want to lose, but again, if we get to a point where things start to change, our value proposition starts to fall off, there is no reason to force that. And I think if I think about how well diversified the company is today when those situations occur, we don\u2019t need to force it. I think that, that\u2019s a \u2013 of the eight different business line items you are seeing there on the blue green slide, that\u2019s an area at least specific to Jabil, that probably isn\u2019t going to have a lot of hyper growth to it for some of the reasons you described and others. If I had to handicap it today, again, knowing that our numbers aren\u2019t going to be exact, the $2.2 billion we are showing in that line item, I think it might come in a little bit stronger than that, but again, directionally, I think network and storage will be down year-on-year.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thank you for that. And Mike, regarding the inventories, which came down nicely and your inventory days were down and you did talk about that the supply chain being a little bit more efficient than it had been. Do you expect to maintain those low inventory levels as we get through next year and is that part of your pretty strong free cash flow guidance?\nMike Dastoor: Yes, that is certainly part of our guidance. That is part of our assumption. We are constantly working on inventory levels in the organization and I feel good about continuing to take that down further over the year.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you. That\u2019s it for our call today. This call is concluded. Please reach out to us if you have any further questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I will begin by offering my sincere gratitude to all of you here at Jabil. Thanks for hanging in there during these trying times, while never compromising the safety of our people. Your response, stamina and attitude had been amazing and so appreciated. Again, thank you all. Today is our third consecutive year, where we not only share our results and give a quarterly guide, but we also provide a complete outlook for the year ahead. So, I will get us started with thoughts on our outlook and Mike will offer additional detail during his follow-on remarks. Moving to Slide 11, I will offer a few thoughts on our approach beginning with diversity and inclusion. Being that Jabil is a service business, we know that each employee is critical to our success. We also know that each employee has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, all day and everyday. We operate our business in 30 plus countries, employing people that don't look the same, don't talk the same, people that practice different religions have different sexual orientations, people with physical limitations and neuro diversities. Diversity and inclusion is top of mind as we employ folks all around the world, but we have got more work to do. We won't abide racism for lack of human rights. We won't accept discrimination for social injustice. Our team challenges the status quo and we hold ourselves accountable through action. Most recently, we formed a 9-person council to assist and guide our internal D&I efforts. This council will provide advocacy as we push to improve our own shortcomings. These 9-council leaders are talented and without a doubt will make us better. Consistent with this focus, we are pleased to be a premium sponsor for the upcoming Special Olympics U.S. games. The sponsorship has evolved into a partnership granting our employees the remarkable opportunity to engage with the athletes and their coaches. This will also make us better. In summary, our team continues to safeguard our work environment and ensure that everyone can be their true self without fear or anxiety, without harm or recourse and with full acceptance of our individual differences. The second aspect of our approach pertains to ESG and sustainability, a table we aim to always do what's right. This includes doing right by our planet and doing right in helping others. We will expand our use of clean energy as we strive to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% within the next 5 to 6 years. Equally important is the pursuit of our sustainability goals as influenced by the United Nations' decade of action. We are determined to lead our industry by attaining highest standards in the areas of employee safety, water usage, hazardous waste and supply chain management. Also, we understand what gets measured gets done. So we have applied this mantra to our people and their incredible generosity, which allows us to quantify their contributions as they volunteer their personal time. Let's now turn to Slide 13. This slide paints a terrific picture underscoring the effectiveness of our team and the strength of our commercial portfolio. What you see is two segments, where one plus one equals three. Two segments that complement one another both in terms of in markets and capabilities, relevant capabilities that when properly combined, fuel our services and our solutions. Two segments that, when placed side by side, suggest resiliency at scale. So, let's break down each segment. Please flip to Slide 14. Roughly 50% of our DMS segment is comprised of Jabil businesses that operate in a regulated type environment, businesses such as healthcare and automotive. These end markets share similar certification and validation requirements and must meet certain standards as they bring products to market. At the same time, capital investments align with the longer, more stable product lifecycles. The other half of our DMS segment is also comprised of two divisions, our connected devices and mobility divisions. These divisions excel at high volume production, advanced material sciences, aesthetically complex molding, precision mechanics and flexible automation. We are excited about the balanced portfolio within our DMS segment with a focus on expanding margins while offering reliable cash flows. Let's now move to Slide 15, where I will share a few thoughts on our EMS segment. Jabil's ability to combine years of manufacturing know-how and process standards with data analytics set us apart. Our longstanding customers leverage Jabil's unique IT network as we manage all types of sophisticated global supply chains. Today, we serve a wonderful blend of markets across our EMS segment, markets that include 5G and cloud, industrial and semi-cap, digital print and retail, networking and storage. We are excited about the broad range of customers in our EMS segment with a focus on growing cash flows while offering stable margins. Putting this all together, let's look at our outlook on Slide 16. For fiscal \u201821, we plan to deliver a core operating margin of 4% on revenues of $26.5 billion. This mirrors what we committed to you 1 year ago. It's important to note that the 4% operating margin on the $26 billion correlates to $4 in core EPS, again, marrying what we said last September. Three primary actions give us confidence in our outlook: one, the improved makeup of our commercial portfolio; two, reduce levels of overhead; and three, lower cost associated with COVID. These three actions sum to roughly $180 million to $190 million of additional income year-on-year, FY \u201820 to FY \u201821. If I step back and think about where we are at today, much of our success here at Jabil is because we placed the needs of the customer first and we do so through non-parochial sharing of all resources and all capabilities. I think about this sharing as frictionless collaboration. When this collaboration is combined with the experience and actions of our team, you have a winning recipe, a recipe which delivers optimized solutions and services to our customers. I ask that you now please turn to Slide 18. In closing, our outlook for fiscal \u201821 is indicative of the positive momentum we are carrying into the year. It's an outlook that's grounded by the continuation of our straightforward strategy, a strategy built on five basic pillars ensuring our business mix remains well diversified, obsessing over our customers, while leading with engineering, driving growth through sharing and integrating our capabilities, expanding margins by contouring our portfolio, and leveraging our varied end markets to deliver reliable cash flows. Lastly, to our entire leadership team, once again, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. Most importantly, thank you for being your true self. As CEO, I am honored to serve you year-in and year-out. I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Hi, Adam. Thanks for the nice comment. I will let Mike talk about the restructuring and maybe let's get it clarify that a little bit. In terms of COVID, geez, I am really happy with how we handled it all in a really, really kind of opaque, murky deal. I mean, we take you back to February, things are blowing up. I think our COVID costs in February on a total monthly basis were like $55 million, $60 million for the month then we moved into Q3 and COVID costs were around $50 million and then Q4. As we are sitting in the June call, I think either Mike or I said Q4 would be around $40 million, $50 million. And as we got into 4Q, June was still kind of along that run-rate that has started to dissipate a bit in July and in a more normalized run-rate when compared to FY \u201821 as we are leaving August and as we continue to index through September, our run-rate in September looks to be much like August. So, assuming that the whole world doesn't blow up again, at that point, all bets are off, but with everything kind of the way we see it, we feel pretty confident in the 30% to 50%, I think a way to think about those costs are maybe 60%, 65% in the first half of the year and something like 35% to 40% in the back half of the year. And with that, maybe you could expand a little bit on the restructuring question. I will let Mike address that. I don't want to get into all the puts and takes only because Ruplu our industrial business has all kinds of puts and takes. I would say, I'd \u2013 if I were to knowing that we are not going to be right on any of these numbers exactly, if I had to handicap industrial and semi-cap, I would say I agree with your comments. If there is, if we are going to handicap that one way or the other sitting here today for the year, there is probably more upside than not, I would say certainly in \u2013 certainly in semi-cap and that's offset by some softness at the moment in industrial and I think Mike talked in his prepared remarks about construction starts both residential and commercial we think will soften a bit, certainly through the first half of the year and then regain some momentum towards the back half of the year, but I think you are thinking about that the right way. Thanks, Ruplu. Thanks, Jim. Sure. So, I think it's really important for everybody to understand that our move to consignment wasn't reactionary it wasn't something that we just thought of. If you go back and I don't remember when we first started talking about our cloud business, it was 4, 5, 6 earnings calls ago. I remember at that point in time, we gave it enough attention we were doing the JJMD deal and we also in one of those calls, we had two separate slides, one talking about our JJMD engagement in collaboration, which by the way is going very well and then we had a slide on cloud. There is a lot of questions at that time about are we getting into white box manufacturing in this set and the other and we have been very, very consistent in our approach strategically the cloud business that we are going to go into this in the geocentric service model, it was going to be a very asset-light very agile model both on the fixed asset and networking capital side as that business is scaled through, call it back half of \u201819 all through \u201820, we have always had a thought process in terms of again keeping the networking capital asset-light as well. So this has been in the works for quite some time. And I would say the consignment model that we have went through is largely around our cloud business and it's largely in place. So, again, if you look at the shape of our EMS business, I think our guide for Q1 per Mike's comments in the press release is like $3.2 billion for EMS. You compare that to a $3.7 billion, Q1 \u201820 to Q1 \u201821, that's just reflective, largely around consignment. And then we also have some intentional reshaping of our networking storage business on top of that, but I would say, you can consider it in place and it will be reflective quarter-to-quarter throughout the year. I want to be careful that I understand your comment, because this is kind of an important topic. The $3.2 billion saying it straight up right, the $3.2 billion guide for EMS in Q1 is fully reflective of the consignment model. So there is no \u2013 there is no jeez, we are going to come back and go, the $3.2 billion turned into $2.5 billion because of consignment, it's all in. So, again if you take that new and you take a look at our Q1 \u201821 relative to our Q1 \u201820 EMS, I think you will see the distinction there Q1 \u201820 in EMS was around $3.7 billion, something like that, Q1 of \u201821 is $3.2 billion. So again, it's fully reflected. In addition to that, Jim, I believe that the blue green slides that we shared I spoke to it a bit, Mike went a bit deeper shows our overall company revenue for the year around $26.5 billion. The EMS segment, which is where our cloud business sits, show shows $12.5 billion. So again, overall for the company for the year $26.5 billion midpoint, about $14 billion of that is our DMS segment $12.5 billion is our EMS segment. That's where our cloud business sits. Those numbers also are fully reflective of any and all consignment. Well, we talked about that last year. That was a hot topic as we were coming out of \u201819 into \u201820 and COVID kind of dominated everything. But that's something we watch every week, every month. And I think we had talked about the fact that the first half of \u201819, I may have \u2013 I maybe off the quarter to Jim, but directionally as we exited fiscal \u201819 going into first half of \u201820, somewhere in that timeframe, when the tariff talks were hot and heavy and relatively new in front of headlines, we had said we were going to have a two to three quarter portion of our business, where we were going to spend upwards of $20 million, $25 million in terms of moving product around for customers. At that point in time, we have suggested that if the macro holds or even weakens a little bit, all of this product needs to get built. And I can't think of a better place for customers to build it than at Jabil just because of our global footprint. So, we can continue to keep an eye on that. As mentioned previously that if we kind of collate up all of our business in Mainland China as we sit today and I have said this in the past, there are certain parts of that business that we just don't think will move based on the indigenous supply chain and other factors. We have also said that there is a significant amount of our China revenue today that China for other parts of the world, non-U.S. and then the China revenue that we have that happens to be products to be consumed and shipped to the U.S. Some of that has already shifted and some of it customers look at it and they are comfortable keeping it in China for now. Yes, thanks, Jim. Okay. Well, there is couple questions in there and I appreciate you not putting the cart before the horse, although I think we have kind of asked for it, because we came out with the four and the four. So, we got a lot of work to do to deliver the four and the four, but we wouldn't have put it out there, if we didn't see a clear path. Yes. For the last 3, 4 years, we have been talking about diversifying the top line, but at the same time, we have been caveating those comments with the fact that we are not going to chase revenue for the sake of chasing revenue. We are going to diversify income and cash flows, which is exactly what I think we have been up to. And I would suggest our team has been quite successful in that. If I think about FY \u201821, we are certainly not chasing revenue because on an absolute basis, some of this is consignment, revenues going down, but again, I would say overall, it is about us kind of continually taking a file and not a chisel and filing the portfolio with a real kind of no kidding focus on the margins in the cash flows. So, that's what we are up to and we are going to work really hard to do our best to deliver that the four and the four. I would say it's neutral. That one aspect is neutral. It's \u2013 there is in our geocentric asset-light service business there is high dollar components, where we don't provide much value. And so having those pass-through materials is distortive to the real returns we should be getting on the value add we provide the customer. I would say our cloud business is founded on the services our team provides the geocentric nature of it, the flexibility, the agility, I mean, I think about COVID was unplanned and COVID hits and all of a sudden, people are working remotely working from homes and the ability of our of our cloud team to react all by the way as well as our mobility team and our connected devices team. I mean, those volumes spiked up. So, I would say it's the most important part of our approach to that model is \u2013 or that businesses is the model itself and the relationships that we have, Steve. Yes, we will need it. It was a good win by lightning last night. So thank you. Mark, I really appreciate the question. I am not trying to duck the question. But we are in the process now of varying conversations going on with current customers, hyperscale customers, smaller customers. So, I just \u2013 I don't want to get into it on a customer by customer basis. I think what we have said in the past is we have got reasonably good confidence in our approach to what we are doing in that market overall and we certainly expect that market to be kind of multi-customer faceted if you will and that's still our path and still our intent. Which risk in particular? Okay, I understand the question and it's appreciated. I would say, if I am sitting on your side of the table, along with kind of the buy side folks, it's immaterial. I will give you an example. And I am not suggesting that there is not pockets that are material, but in the big picture of what we just guided to our outlook for Q1 and then certainly for \u201821, I think all those puts and takes there is a lot of them, I think they are immaterial. I give you an example. There has certainly been on Steve Borges' business with healthcare, there has certainly been some upside near-term upside in healthcare through the back half of \u201820 and probably the first quarter or two in \u201821 demand driven solely by COVID. Yes, there has been a falloff in his business due to COVID with elective surgeries as an example. Yet you spin all that up and you kind of get kind of a normalized business plan and same holds true with some puts and takes industrials, same holds true with some puts and takes in connected devices, although that ended up being a net strength. So, I would say all in all, we don't have a crystal ball, but our Q1 guide and our overall outlook for the year, Mark, we have taken kind of all those puts and takes, we have stress tested it with all the teams and we feel like we have kind of normalized it to the 4%, the $4 and $26.5 billion in revenue. Yes, you are welcome. Okay, Shannon, that's a cool question. That's kind of what we are all about. We are a company at the core that builds stuff. And so we are, if I think Mike, when you talked about CapEx in his prepared remarks talked about a split between growth and maintenance, I would say in terms of productivity in the factories, that's probably split between maintenance and growth. I would say, we are one of the leading companies that I know of in terms of automation what I would call flexible automation, what I would call automated, real useful automated platforms, you combine that with augmented reality, that will start hitting our factory floors, you combine that with machine learning. And then the other thing I think that sets Jabil apart is as you take all of that, Shannon, we have got a ton of factories, call it, we run our \u2013 we largely run most of our business on 35, 40 sites, although we have more. If I take those \u2013 if I take the sites that are most impactful to our earnings, they are all wrapped together in a single holistic IT system and I don't know that anyone else has that. So, we will always continue to invest and invest aggressively in terms of the technology the productivity that you alluded to. I think what shareholders should hold us accountable for is with those investments and with the aggression around that type of investing I would hold us accountable for continued margin expansion and good cash flows. If I think about the journey we have been on, on top line diversification, where we have been going through that, our margins for 2, 3 years have been stuck around 3.5%. We are starting to see the efforts come through on the margin line. That's why we \u2013 that's why Q1 is looking at 4.5% and the year around 4%. So, I think the returns we are getting on those investments are coming through in terms of our bottom line. Well, I don't want to \u2013 the \u2013 I look at the J&J collaboration and that's kind of business as usual now. We spoke about that for a number of calls. That partnership that the team that's responsible for that, that has gotten so deep and boy has that turned out, I think from both sides, we had high expectations. I think it's turning out better than even we expected and I hope J&J would feel the same, but that the business is so far beyond that. I mean, I think we are talking about healthcare and packaging combined, bumping up towards $5 billion. I think about that business, Shannon. I always have my timing a little bit off, but it's typically directionally correct. Our healthcare and packaging business in FY late \u201817, early \u201818, was like a $2 billion business, then it started bumping up against $2.5 billion. FY \u201819 healthcare and packaging, was probably closer to $3 billion. Last year, it was closer to $4 billion. And now we are bumping up against $5 billion. And again, as pleased as we are with the Johnson & Johnson collaboration, it's just it's a lot more than that. Steve and his team are focused in areas so broad-based today relative to 4 years ago with things like pharma, the med device, orthopedics, diagnostics, etcetera. And then I think they will also start to gravitate towards digital analytics and digital diagnosis as well. And then you add to it, I am very, very excited about what the next couple of years hold for our consumer packaging business as well. So, that line item when you look at it on the green blue slide, again, this is a little bit of a commentary around the whole company, but the healthcare packaging line is as diverse both end market and customer base as it's ever been. Yes. Thanks, Shannon. What I would concur is it is confusing from the outside in, it's an interesting market. I think, I don't want to generalize, but a portion of the automotive market is starting to be just a big rolling mobile device and that's a really good spot for us and that's where we are focused most of our attention. We do support legacy automotive technology. But as we continue to look forward, a lot of our attention will be again, if you just think of the automotive industry in the next 10 years being a connected device on four wheels. That's kind of how we look at it and that's where we are making most of our investments. I would say that's probably best case. Yes, we are thinking somewhere I would say volumes and whatnot start to heat up call it 2025, something like that, but there is a lot of work. There is a lot of work that goes in between now and then. So, we will be busy. Thanks, Paul. Yes. Yes, I don't know, I look at it quite simply as I want, I don't ever \u2013 I don't want ever want to walk away from a relationship. But there are certain relationships where if we get to a point that customers can provide, others than Jabil business and get better value-add for it, then so be it. And I think in the network storage space, it's been a market that we have played in actively since the early 90s. We have got some longstanding relationships that are, I don't want to lose, but again, if we get to a point where things start to change, our value proposition starts to fall off, there is no reason to force that. And I think if I think about how well diversified the company is today when those situations occur, we don't need to force it. I think that, that's a \u2013 of the eight different business line items you are seeing there on the blue green slide, that's an area at least specific to Jabil, that probably isn't going to have a lot of hyper growth to it for some of the reasons you described and others. If I had to handicap it today, again, knowing that our numbers aren't going to be exact, the $2.2 billion we are showing in that line item, I think it might come in a little bit stronger than that, but again, directionally, I think network and storage will be down year-on-year."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thank you, Adam and good morning everyone. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. Both segments executed extremely well and delivered financial results that came in well above the guidance we provided on June 19. The overperformance was driven mainly by two factors. First, during Q4, we experienced fewer corporate-related disruptions than we anticipated in June, which resulted in higher than expected throughput in our plans, a more efficient supply chain and lower corporate related expenses. And second, our teams in both segments quickly moved to capitalize on upside demand, mainly in the mobility, 5G wireless and cloud end-markets. The compounding effects of higher than expected sales, improved productivity and lower costs allowed us to deliver strong revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in Q4 well above our expectations in June. With that, I will now review our Q4 and fiscal \u201820 financial results. Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.3 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $197 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.44. Core operating income during the quarter was $255 million, well above our expectations in June, driven mainly by the aforementioned higher sales and lower COVID-related impact that came in approximately $25 million lower than anticipated. Net interest expense during the quarter was $46 million. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Core diluted earnings per share was $0.98, an 11% improvement over the prior quarter. For the full fiscal year, net revenue was $27.3 billion, up 8% year-over-year. FY \u201820 GAAP operating income was $500 million, with GAAP net income of $54 million. GAAP net diluted earnings per share, was $0.35 for the year. Core operating income was $864 million, representing a core operating margin of 3.2%. Core diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.90. Now, turning to our fourth quarter and FY \u201820 segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $2.8 billion, up 17% year-over-year. This growth was mainly due to our mobility and healthcare end markets. Core margins for the segment improved 60 basis points year-over-year to 3.5%. Revenue for our EMS segment increased by 8% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, driven mainly by the semi-cap, 5G wireless and cloud end-markets. Core margins for the segment were 3.5% during the quarter. For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $10.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year mainly due to our healthcare business. Core margins for the segment were 3.9%. Moving to EMS, in FY \u201820, revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to $16.6 billion as our value proposition continues to be well received in the areas of 5G wireless, cloud and semi cap. Core margins for the segment were 2.7%. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q4, inventory days came in better than expected at 56 days, a decline of 11 days sequentially. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $241 million and for the full fiscal year came in as expected at $796 million. Our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong coming in at $687 million. As a result, the strong fourth quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $461 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.7x and cash balances of $1.4 billion. To further strengthen our balance sheet during Q4, we issued a $600 million 3% senior note maturing in January of 2031. We used the proceeds to redeem our $400 million 5.625% senior notes due in December 2020. We ended Q4 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity along with our quarter end cash balance, Jabil ended Q4 with access to more than $5.2 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility to navigate the current market environment. During Q4, we repurchased approximately 760,000 shares for $25 million bringing our total year-to-date repurchases to $215 million. In closing, I am very pleased with our strong execution and resiliency in a challenging environment and are encouraged by the positive momentum we carry into fiscal \u201821. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark. Thanks Mark. I would also like to thank our employees for their hard work, dedication and excellent execution during the challenging FY \u201820. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide you with a framework that highlights how we will execute on our strategy and deliver on our financial commitments in the coming year. As we turn our focus to 2021, our financial priorities remain unchanged. First, we are fully focused on expanding margins. To position the company to deliver higher margins over the last few years, we have targeted growth in areas of our business, that have higher return profiles that offer accretive margins and strong cash flow streams. At the same time, we are focused on optimizing costs to ensure we deliver SG&A leverage across the worldwide Jabil footprint. Secondly, in FY \u201821, we are forecasting core earnings per share to improve nearly 40% over FY \u201820. And finally, we are focused on generating strong free cash flow through optimization of working capital and disciplined CapEx management. Next, let's take a look at each of our operating segments and I would like to walk you through what we are seeing in the different end markets we serve and how each of these plays a role in delivering our financial targets. Our DMS team's strong performance over the last few years reflects our improving business mix as a result of our intense focus on diversifying our end-markets, products and customers to create a more sustainable business. The team continues to do a tremendous job leveraging our deep capabilities in this segment like tooling, precision mechanics, acoustics, optics, automation, and material sciences to capture new opportunities in high value adjacent markets. Nowhere is as clearer than in our healthcare and packaging businesses, which have grown tremendously over the last few years through several key wins, including a transformational strategic healthcare collaboration. Today, we are one of the largest healthcare manufacturing solutions companies in the world and we are well positioned to capture future similar opportunities. In packaging, we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the convergence of electronics and smart and eco-friendly packaging. As we move to automotive, the bulk of our business focuses on electrification of auto based on a nearly 10-year relationship with the leading electric automotive company in the world. In the near-term, this market is recovering faster than we expected just a few months ago. Looking forward, we remain well-positioned as demand for increased safety, governmental mission regulations and the race towards electrification and autonomous vehicles are all playing a significant role in shaping the future of driving as we know it. Moving to connected devices, as more people worked and learned from home, we saw good demand for products, such as tablets, headphones and smart watches in FY \u201820. As we move forward into FY \u201821, we expect this dynamic to remain. Beyond these devices, we are also continuing to shape the portfolio with products that meet our margin and cash flow profiles. Consequently, this will result in lower revenue for FY \u201821. Beyond FY \u201821, we believe the adoption of 5G will provide a further catalyst for future growth. And finally, within mobility, we remain extremely well-positioned across all models and components as we continue to benefit from our diversification strategy. The out-of-season launch continues to perform extremely well. In tandem with this, the upcoming next generation launch which began in Q4 is going extremely well. Our team's technical expertise and focus on operational efficiencies continues to contribute to a very strong customer relationship. In summary, for DMS to me, the key takeaway this year is the considerable mix shift underway. In FY \u201821, healthcare and packaging is expected to be more than a third of our DMS business, with estimated revenue growth of approximately $600 million in FY \u201821. Putting it all together for DMS in FY \u201821, we are expecting an impressive 80 basis points of margin expansion on mid to high single-digit revenue growth. Turning now to EMS, the trends in technologies disrupting the IT industry today are numerous and accelerating at a rate never seen before. The interplay between a dramatic increase in bandwidth brought about by 5G and the ever-growing power of computing in the cloud is creating a technology and business ecosystem that is changing at faster rates than earlier generations. All of this is happening in the context of increased consumption of silicon chips, unprecedented change in the retail landscape, additive manufacturing and software-driven architectures. In digital print and retail, we continue to expect softness during the first half of FY \u201821 driven by office and retail closures. However, longer term we are well-positioned in these end-markets as we partner with our customers to bring next generation print and retail technologies to market. Shifting gears to industrial, demand has been relatively consistent to-date, but moving forward, we are seeing signs that new building starts are being delayed, which could have an impact on demand in the first half of our fiscal year. However, in the medium to longer term, we are well positioned to take advantage of favorable macro tailwinds through capturing growth in the smart metering, power conversion and energy storage spaces. In semi-cap during the slowdown, the team did an excellent job of aggressively managing our costs while capturing market share and diversifying our business across both the front-end and back-end. With the ongoing recovery in the space, our efforts over the last 18 months are manifesting in stronger results. We are seeing solid demand and so far customers continue to march ahead with new fab plant investments, executing to their 2020 and 2021 roadmaps. In cloud, our unique offering continues to resonate with the hyperscalers, evidenced by the significant growth over the last 3 years. And this growth has only accelerated in the near-term as work and learn from home has significantly increased the demand for cloud infrastructure. Our customers are looking for much more flexibility in their server and storage hardware supply chains, while greatly reducing their cycle times. The message that is resonating with our customers is our design to dust capability to provide a consistent experience across capabilities, functions and geographies. Keep in mind that when we talk about our design to dust value prop, we can design, create, make and recycle all within the same four walls, which is incredibly powerful as security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our customers. Coupled with our vertical integration strategy, this level of engagement creates very sticky relationships with our customers. It's worth reminding everyone our cloud business is a bit unique and has been deliberately structured as a geocentric asset-light service offering. With this in mind in FY \u201821, approximately $1 billion in components we procure and integrate will shift from the current purchase and resale model to a consignment service model. We will benefit from higher margins and lower cash use in this business as a result of the transition, which will further bolster the asset light nature of our offering. Another area undergoing rapid disruption is the 5G wireless end market. Over the last several years, we have invested in accelerated NPI, test processes and R&D, increasing our stickiness with customers and so maintaining our leadership role in the manufacture of base stations and radios as we transition to a 5G world. We continue to see growth in 5G offset by legacy wireless as the market transitions to newer technology. In FY \u201821, we expect 5G infrastructure rollouts to continue as network operators upgrade their services. And then finally, within the legacy networking and storage end markets, we expect consistent networking demand, but reduced storage demand driven by cautious overall enterprise spend and the ongoing shift to the cloud. In FY \u201821, this demand dynamic coupled with our decision not to pursue other products that do not meet our margin and cash flow profiles will result in lower revenue. Following 3 years of tremendous growth as part of our diversification efforts, we expect EMS revenues to be down year-over-year, mainly due to the consignment shift within our cloud business and lower networking and storage revenue. With the current mix of business in EMS, we expect a healthy 80 basis points of core margin expansion in fiscal \u201821. Turning to the next slide, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to expand overall core margins through cost optimization and targeted growth. We also anticipate a COVID related negative impact of approximately $30 million to $50 million for the year, significantly less than FY \u201820 due to fewer COVID related disruptions in our plants and the supply chain, along with lower PP&E costs. As a result at an enterprise level, we are well-positioned to deliver 4% in core margins for FY \u201821. Turning now to our CapEx guidance for FY \u201821, net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $800 million consistent with FY \u201820. This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth. Let's talk about our maintenance CapEx for a moment. We now have over 100 sites in 31 countries. At this scale, our factories require approximately $550 million in annual maintenance investments. This is inclusive of investments in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization, which will drive optimization across our footprint and position us to deliver higher profitability. We are also investing in strategic growth in targeted areas of our business that are expected to deliver strong margin expansion and free cash flow. The bulk of our strategic growth CapEx will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, semi-cap and packaging end markets. Turning now to free cash flow, in FY \u201821, we intend to continue generating strong cash flows as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team's ability to execute and efficiently manage working capital. Working capital improvements will come mainly through improved inventory levels. These factors, coupled with our disciplined CapEx, gives me confidence in our ability to deliver adjusted free cash flows of more than $600 million in FY \u201821. Turning now to our capital allocation framework, our capital return framework beyond organic investments will prioritize the commitment to our dividend, share repurchases and a combination of targeted M&A, and optimizing our capital structure. We are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows, which will allow us to continue to return capital to shareholders, maintain investment grade ratings and ensure we maintain an optimal capital structure. Turning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase by 1% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to decrease 15% on a year-over-year basis to $3.2 billion. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal \u201821 to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.3 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $295 million to $335 million, with core operating margin in the range of 4.4% to 4.6%. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $238 million to $283 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.35. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.79 to $1.02. The tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter is estimated to be in the range of 26% to 28%. As we transition to our final slide, you can really begin to see the earnings power of a diversified and balanced Jabil. Today, our business serves a diverse plan of end-markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4% in core margins in FY \u201821 along with $4 in core EPS and more than $600 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. I would like to thank you for your time today and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call back over to Adam. The restructuring effort is on top of that nothing to do with the COVID reduction at all, Adam? Yes. So there is a couple of things in that. One is if I take a look at kind of our DMS business, I think kind of year-on-year Q1 \u201820 to \u201821 in the range of around 1%, so on the DMS Q1 to Q1. And I would think about our DMS business, Adam, more kind of first half to first half just based on timing of some products. So, if I take a look at and I don't know \u2013 I don't know the exact numbers, but rough numbers would be kind of DMS, first half, first half of \u201820 to first half of \u201821, we will probably see growth in the 6% to 8% range. And then I think if you look at the blue green slide overall for the year, DMS, so will be up about $800 million from call it 13, 13.2 up to around 14. So, I wouldn't get too caught up in the Q1 revenue numbers. And then overall for the enterprise, if we execute well in Q1, like Mike said in his prepared remarks, we expect margins to be around the 4.5% range. With that same execution kind of total comparison, we could have a six handle on our margins for DMS in Q1. So, off to a relatively strong start which is typically how our years kick off. And I would say as I think about kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, if I am thinking about shaping the year, at an enterprise level, margins should be pretty stable. So, if we kick off with a 4.5%, I think Q4, we could end somewhere around 4% and then Q2, Q3 in between in the high 3s something like that and if you sum all that up kind of on a weighted average basis, EMS to DMS, we are shooting for 4% overall for the enterprise for \u201821. I think it's because every couple of years Ruplu, we have been on, I don't know a 5 \u2013 4, 5, 6-year journey. And we disengaged with BlackBerry back in the day. We sold our services business. We are really successful with in the mobility sector. And we have been working really, really hard to continue to diversify the portfolio. I don't think that work is ever done, but where we sit today, if you just kind of sit back and look at the \u2013 for lack of better word, the portfolio slide on the blue and the green, geez, we have got, 8 areas of our business reflected there and I just love the way it looks. I said something like that in my prepared remarks. As part of kind of always reshaping there, I think I use the word contouring the portfolio we would like to have businesses together that makes sense from a capability perspective and market perspective. And we just felt like automotive and transport fits really well with our healthcare business in terms of overall regulated markets. And then the other shift we made and again, I know this can be aggravating to investors, because it ends up being a lot to follow. That's not our intention. Our intention is to give us a good platform again for the next 24 to 36 months. We took our smart home business, which had been in our networking storage, because a lot of devices in home were networked together and we moved some of that over to connected devices just because of 5G coming on board. And when we think about things throughout the home, from a capabilities and an end-market perspective, it fit really well into connected devices. The good news is those modest shifts don't change the enterprise level numbers, but that's the logic behind it. Hey, Paul. Thanks for the question. We did call some we are constantly reshaping the portfolio as we see it right now on the networking and storage side, in particular. We have been looking at all businesses we have. I think we have declared a couple of years ago that we are focusing on margins. We are focusing on free cash flow. And we are tightening up all our financial metrics around existing and future customers. So, that's one of the areas that we have looked at, in particular. I talked about connected devices as well in my prepared remarks. That's another one where we have gone and called some customers there. So, it's all directional. We have said we will do that. We will focus on that. And that is exactly what we are doing. Yes, if you look at the blue and green slide, I will just highlight the networking and storage, that's the last line on the blue side, that's down by about $600 million. A lot of that is a simple straightforward, hey, let's get this to our financial metric levels and then you have connected devices on the green side as well. That's the \u2013 there is parts of business that are doing really well on the connected devices and then there is parts that we feel the financial metrics don't just justify moving ahead with them. Yes, that is certainly part of our guidance. That is part of our assumption. We are constantly working on inventory levels in the organization and I feel good about continuing to take that down further over the year."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Adam Berry, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil\u2019s third quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today\u2019s call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the discussion and view the slides, you will need to be logged into our webcast on jabil.com. At the end of today\u2019s call, both the presentation and a replay of the call will be available on Jabil\u2019s Investor Relations website. During today\u2019s call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including among other things, those regarding our outlook for our business and expected fourth quarter and fiscal \u201820 net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Mondello.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I\u2019ll begin by providing a brief business update before turning the call over to Mike, where he\u2019ll offer details on our Q3 performance and address our guidance for the balance of the year. So, before I get into the business at hand, I\u2019d like to extend a warm thanks to our people here at Jabil for their hard work and commitment, especially during these trying times. I tend to think that successful and sustainable organizations are evaluated not only on their ability to deal with what they can control, but also on their ability to react and adapt to the environment, especially in environments that shift suddenly and shift unexpectedly. To this, I give our team high marks. Their response to COVID-19 gives me confidence and demonstrates our resiliency. At Jabil, we help design, develop and bring to life numerous products, products that the world depends on. In many ways, this pandemic has reinforced that Jabil itself is an essential business. If I may, I\u2019ll now take you back to our second fiscal quarter for proper context specific to COVID. As our teams in China attempted to return from Chinese New Year in mid-February, they were faced with travel lockdowns, quarantines, and the need for social distancing. Add to this the fact that our sites in China were operating at less than 50% capacity. Given the ambiguity that was fast unfolding, we rescinded our financial outlook for the fiscal year. As we moved into the third quarter, COVID quickly spread impacting regions and countries that are home to our many factories. March quickly turned into April and April to May. And while many of us were hunkered down, following stay-at-home orders, transforming kitchens or bedrooms or garages into new found workspaces, our factories by and large continued to build and ship product. Most importantly, throughout it all, the global incident rate of confirmed COVID cases across Jabil remained remarkably low. I want to offer a special thanks to all of our frontline workers, those of you that work so hard in keeping our people safe, while taking amazing care of our customers directly from the factory floor, your ability to execute and perform has been nothing short of spectacular. And on top of it all, together, you created a COVID playbook that we use today across all sites, a playbook of protocols and best practices that we openly share with suppliers, customers, communities and competitors. Moving on to the critical business catalysts for the quarter. We saw strong demand in health care and packaging, cloud, edge devices and mobility. In our health care sector, we joined the fight against COVID as it was simply the right thing to do. Our teams quickly transformed manufacturing lines around the world, contributing to the production of critical products, such as ventilators, specialized manifolds, 3D printed components, face shields, protective masks and test kits. In terms of our packaging business, which serves many of the world\u2019s top consumer brands, demand was strong in areas like cleaners and disinfectants, touch-less dispensers, antibacterial products, and eat-at-home food products. At the same time, internet usage was exploding, prompted by remote learning and video conferencing. Teams from our cloud sector along with the teams from our mobility and edge device sectors were in full-blown customer care mode as end users sought digital access to family, friends, business colleagues and patients, a trend likely to be part of the world\u2019s new normal. During the quarter, these areas of strength were offset by weakness in our automotive and transport, and print & retail sectors. Nonetheless, our well-diversified commercial portfolio allowed us to deliver $6.3 billion in revenue, in line with our expectation. To me, this is quite meaningful. With each passing year, the blend of our revenues becomes better balanced and far less dependent on any single product or product family. Quite simply, greater diversification increases the reliability of our revenue. Having said this, and as we sit here today, the impact of COVID will cost us roughly $160 million to $170 million for fiscal year \u201820. Therefore, we\u2019re taking aggressive actions to reshape the organization and ready ourselves for fiscal \u201821. We\u2019ll reduce our workforce and in return lower our cost structure by roughly $50 million. I\u2019ll now take a minute and express my appreciation for those impacted by this difficult decision, yet a decision that\u2019s correct for the business. In taking this decision, we\u2019ve done our very best to ensure that everyone is treated with complete respect, care and dignity. As we make our way through the summer months, there\u2019s considerable work ahead as we prepare to host a call with investors, this coming September. For lack of a better description, we look at this call as having a conversation with investors, a conversation about how Jabil management is thinking about fiscal \u201821 during these uncertain times. It\u2019s important to note that throughout this macro uncertainty, we remain steadfast in prioritizing free cash flow and expanding core operating margins. In closing, you can be assured that we\u2019re navigating today\u2019s issues, while being thoughtful about tomorrow\u2019s challenges. Looking ahead, I believe our business landscape and how we choose to conduct our business may look and feel a bit different, it\u2019ll possibly be more efficient, it\u2019ll possibly be more optimized. I think, this can have real benefits as long as we don\u2019t lose a single ounce of our customer intimacy or customer care. Also, I believe key secular trends will remain and remain in our favor. Lastly, plenty of stuff will still need to be built and building stuff is exactly what we do. Thank you. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover our Q3 financial results, I thought it would be helpful to provide a brief update on how COVID-19 has impacted our business and the end markets we serve since we last spoke on March 13th. Following our call in March, COVID-19 quickly spread across the globe. However, as Mark indicated, for most of the quarter, our operations managed to remain largely open. Our teams were the local authorities and a large majority of our factories were deemed essential, so that we continue to build and ship products throughout Q3. In fact, since the end of March, we have largely been operating at 95% capacity, despite a handful of one to two-week closures in areas like Malaysia, India, and California. Putting it all together, at an enterprise level, demand largely held in Q3. However, the makeup of this demand varied extensively by end market and region as the COVID-19 outbreak and stay-at-home orders around the world impacted each in a unique way. Let me walk you through what we\u2019re seeing in the different end markets today. Within mobility, the average out of season launch, which began in February is going extremely well. In tandem with this, the team has also started working on the launch for our upcoming seasonal next-gen mobility products, and this too is on track. Moving to edge devices and lifestyles. As more people work and learn from home, we\u2019re seeing good demand for certain products, such as tablets, headphones and smart watches. In health care, we\u2019re experiencing strong demand in the markets most critical in the fight against COVID-19, ventilators and ventilator splitters, oxygen, and temperature sensing equipment, diagnostic systems, including analyzers and test kits and masks ranging from protective face masks to reusable N95 masks. This trend is being offset by reduced demand for trauma and elective surgery products. Moving to packaging. As a reminder, our packaging business is a supplier to the world\u2019s leading consumer packaged goods companies. COVID-19 is exerting enormous pressure on our customers to ship unprecedented levels of cleaning and food products. Because of this, we\u2019re seeing increasing demand in packaging for laundry products, hard surface cleaners, touch-less dispensers and antibacterial wipes. In addition, we\u2019re also seeing good demand for food packaging spurred on by more people dining at home. Moving to EMS. Within automotive, our near-term results and outlook have been diminished due to lower forecasted worldwide unit sales and OEM factory closures. However, looking forward, we expect weakness in the traditional automotive markets to be partly offset by additional growth in electrification, which continues to gain overall share of this market. In semi-cap, we\u2019re seeing solid demand, driven by the ongoing recovery in this end market as infrastructure spending continues. New fab plant investments are multiyear investments. And so far, customers are marching ahead with their 2020 and 2021 roadmaps. In wireless and 5G, consistent with prior quarters, we continue to see growth in 5G that is being offset by 4G as the market transitions to newer technology. In the near term, we expect 5G infrastructure rollouts to continue as network operators upgrade their services. In cloud, our teams are seeing an increased demand for cloud infrastructure created by stay-at-home orders around the world, which is translating to higher growth. Moving to print and retail, we expect continued pressure in these end markets in the near term, driven mainly by office closures and stay-at-home orders. Turning now to industrial and energy. Demand has been relatively consistent to-date. But, moving forward, we are seeing signs of new building starts being delayed. This could have an impact on future demand. And then finally, within the enterprise end markets, we are seeing increased demand for networking products due to work-from-home dynamics, offset by cautious overall enterprise spread. We anticipate this demand dynamic to continue over the next few quarters. From a cost perspective, during Q3, we incurred approximately $60 million in direct and indirect costs associated with COVID-19 outbreak. The makeup of these costs consisted mainly of lower factory utilization due to lockdown restrictions, supply chain, inefficiencies and PP&E costs to keep our people safe. Turning now to our Q3 financial results. The combination of our ability to largely remain open, efficiently navigate sporadic factory shutdowns and the diverse nature of our end markets allowed us to deliver $6.3 billion in net revenue during the quarter, in line with internal forecast. To me, this is a meaningful and further illustration that our diversification strategy is working. GAAP operating income was $59 million and GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.34. Core operating income during the quarter was $172 million. Net interest expense during the quarter came in better-than-expected at $49 million due to better working capital efficiency and lower interest rates. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 53.7%. At the end of April, our non-U.S. entity\u2019s tax incentive was extended by the government for an additional 10 years, which resulted in revaluation of certain of those entities\u2019 deferred tax assets. While this resulted in a one-time charge of $21 million in Q3, moving forward, this tax incentive extension will continue to benefit our effective tax rate for another 10 years. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.37. It\u2019s worth noting that the reevaluation of deferred tax assets negatively impacted our core diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.14. Next, I\u2019d like to call your attention to an item, which impacted our GAAP results during the quarter. Over the past three years, we\u2019ve experienced tremendous growth, adding in excess of $7 billion in revenue to our results. Importantly, the growth has been intentional and targeted at end markets that offer accretive margin and cash flow profiles. With the success in diversifying the business, we feel, it is an appropriate time specially admits the current economic landscape to take steps to proactively optimize our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies. Therefore, during Q3, we\u2019ve taken steps to reduce our worldwide workforce. For Q3 we incurred approximately $50 million related to this, inclusive of severance costs and extended health care benefits to those impacted. We anticipate these costs will result in a net benefit to core operating income of $40 million to $50 million in FY21. This is in addition to the anticipated savings associated with the 2020 restructuring plan we announced last September. Now, turning to our third quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $2.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year, while core operating income for the segment increased 27% year-over-year. This resulted in core margins expanding 30 basis points to 2.9%. Moving to EMS. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.9 billion, down 2% year-over-year. From an end market perspective, we saw year-over-year strength in the cloud and semi-cap space offset by declines in automotive print and retail. Core margins for the segment came in at 2.6%. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. As anticipated in Q3, inventory levels contracted sequentially, with our days in inventory coming in at 67 days, a decline of three days, quarter-over-quarter. Cash flows provided by operations were $487 million in Q3, and net capital expenditures totaled $143 million. As a result of the strong third quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for Q3 came in stronger than expected at approximately $344 million. It\u2019s worth noting, while we recorded approximately $50 million of expenses in Q3, associated with the aforementioned workforce reductions, the associated cash outflow will largely be in Q4. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.6 times and cash balances of $763 million. During Q3, we took steps to bolster our balance sheet adding over $625 million in liquidity, bringing our available committed capacity under the global credit facilities for $3.7 billion. With this additional capacity along with our quarter end cash balance, Jabil ended Q3 with access to more than $4.5 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility to navigate the current market environment, all while maintaining our investment grade rating. We repurchased approximately 800,000 shares for $21 million in Q3, bringing our total year-to-date repurchases to $190 million. Turning now to our fourth quarter guidance that includes approximately $45 million to $55 million in COVID-19-related costs. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 1% on a year-over-year basis to $2.5 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to decrease 8% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion. We expect total Company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.6 billion for a decrease of 5% at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $145 million to $245 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.86. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.50. Next, I\u2019d like to outline our updated expectations for revenue in fiscal year \u201820 by end market. Within DMS, today\u2019s revenue outlook is largely unchanged. Our diversification within DMS continues to pay dividends even in the current environment. We expect core margins for DMS to be 3.8% for the fiscal year on revenue of approximately $10.3 billion. Turning now to EMS. Within EMS, we\u2019ve reduced our revenue outlook for FY20s driven by automotive, industry and energy, and print & retail, which has been partially offset by continued strength in cloud. We expect margins for EMS to be 2.6% on the year on revenue of approximately $15.9 billion. Putting it all together for the year, we now anticipate revenues will be $26.2 billion and core operating income to be $805 million. This outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $2.60 for the year. We also expect to deliver free cash flows in the range of $400 million to $450 million for the fiscal year. Considering this outlook, to me, it\u2019s clear that our diversification strategy continues to work and has positioned us well to navigate an incredibly challenging market environment. In closing, I\u2019m very proud of our Jabil team and their collective efforts over the past several months. Our early and focused efforts are working to protect the health and safety of our employees. And we continue to be vigilant in increasing our efforts in this area. I\u2019m also very proud of the innovative ways in which Jabil\u2019s teams have collaborated to join the global fight against COVID-19. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. As we begin the Q&A session, I\u2019d like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we cannot address customer product specific questions. We appreciate your cooperation. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter and guidance. Mark, for my first question, I want to ask you about your thoughts on DMS segment seasonality. In a typical year, your November quarter or fiscal 1Q is a strong quarter for the mobility segment, given the new phone launches that happen. But, if the world moves to a scenario where every year we have two main phone launches, maybe one in the May quarter or fiscal 3Q, then how should we think about the impact to DMS segment seasonality? And also, you also have a health care segment that is having strong revenues. So, at a high level, can you just help investors understand how you think about DMS revenue and margin seasonality?\nMark Mondello: Sure, Ruplu? I think, what I\u2019d prefer to do is get into some of that detail during our discussion in September. I mentioned on the prepared remarks, even in this crazy environment, we\u2019re going to do our best to get together with all investors in September and at least just let you know how we\u2019re thinking about everything for fiscal \u201821. On the surface today, I\u2019d be careful not to -- and I know you didn\u2019t mean this, but for the group, right, I\u2019d be careful not to interchange DMS with JGP. Our DMS business, again, is -- got a number of components to it. I would -- if I had to think about what we may say in September is, with the shape of our Green Point business, with the shape of mobility, with our significant diversification inside of JGP. And then, you add to it the tremendous growth we\u2019ve had in the health care packaging side, I would say over time that maybe some of the cyclicality you saw in the business specific to DMS two, three years ago will flatten out a bit.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. That makes sense. And then, just for my last question, if you can talk about any component shortages that you\u2019re still seeing, are you being impacted in terms of being able to ship any revenues because of component shortages? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: I\u2019d characterize it this way, just so just have some relativity. If let\u2019s say, pre COVID, let\u2019s say the supply chain activity behavior pre COVID December-January timeframe was a 10, I think we hit our biggest, divot probably in the March-April timeframe, I\u2019d call that maybe a 5 to 6. I\u2019d say today, we\u2019re back to an 8 or 9. And I think it stays there until we get to the backside of COVID, whenever that is.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great. Thank you so much, and congrats again on giving guidance for the next quarter. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nAdam Tindle: Thanks and good morning Mark, before the pandemic, you were thinking about just under $1 billion of non-GAAP operating income and the new guidance looks like you\u2019d end up just under $800 million at the midpoint, vast majority seems like it\u2019s related to COVID costs. And I wanted to dig into this. I think, you mentioned 160 to $170 million of COVID related cost expected for fiscal \u201820. So, if you could just touch on maybe some of the nature of the cost and really how permanent these costs are. I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s at least a portion of that that is non-recurring and should not impact fiscal \u201821. So, any sort of breakdown between what recurs and what is more of a permanent increase to the cost structure?\nMark Mondello: All right. Adam, I\u2019ll take a shot at it and if I don\u2019t get it right, come back at me. So, I think, pre-COVID, so let\u2019s take -- let\u2019s go way back to September. In September, I think we said for FY20, we do $960 million in core income, then I think in the December call, we took that up to $980 million, if I remember correctly. And today, we\u2019re sitting with the model, if you take midpoint of Q4, we\u2019re about $805 million, something like that, give or take. So, if I go back -- let's not go back all the way to September, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair because we took the numbers up in December. So, go to the December number, call it $980 million, today we\u2019re at $805 million, the delta\u2019s 175. And I think in my prepared remarks, I said that COVID-related costs would be -- for the year, would be a 160 to 170. So, the gap between December and now, 175, COVID related, call it 160 to 170. The rest of it is almost immaterial and a bunch of puts and takes, and noise. In terms of the COVID expense specifically, we talked a little bit about this in March when we talked about a $53 million charge in February alone. I think the nice thing that is happening here is the March call we did -- we had a $53 million charge to COVID, largely in partial February. So, on a monthly basis, we were -- COVID was costing us $60 million, $65 million a month. Then we moved to April, May, June timeframe. I think, Mike alluded to it, in Q3, COVID was about $60 million, give or take. And then, I think Mike in his prepared remarks was suggesting that COVID for Q4 would be $50 million. So, the nice thing is, touch wood, today, trends coming down a bit. I think that has to do with the fact that we\u2019re becoming more optimized in our process and protocols, getting people in and out of factories. By the way, with our number one objective is at all of our factories keeping them safe. And then, how those costs break out, Adam, is we have direct costs which is largely around our protocols, temperature testing, PPE around all of our factories, very consistent to our COVID playbook, again, protocols, processes. Then we\u2019ve had some disruptions in 3Q in terms of either government shutting down factories, states shutting down factories. Where we\u2019ve had some confirmed COVID cases, we closed our factories until we can get testing completed. Through all that, we\u2019re paying the idle labor. I think that\u2019s the right thing to do in this time and place. And then also, we\u2019re just -- just general pockets of disruption. So, today, our entire factory networks running at call it 90%, 95% and I think revenue reflects that. But, that could lead to the question of Gee, factory networks seem to be running at a normalized pace, why still the COVID costs? And the truth is, 3Q and we anticipate in 4Q, we\u2019ll still have some one-off pockets of disruption, and we\u2019ve kind of tried to handicap that as best we could for the fourth quarter.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And it sounds like generally to summarize kind of on track versus your initial plan at the Analyst Day, if you were to exclude the COVID costs. And I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead. But, as we think about the fiscal \u201821 plan that you laid out that had that $4 EPS number, if I think about what\u2019s going on today, you\u2019ve got an incremental $15 million cost optimization on top of it. It seems like DMS ramp is well on track. What would be maybe the headwinds today versus that initial $4 EPS number plan?\nMark Mondello: Let\u2019s talk about that in September. And I say that not -- I don\u2019t want to be evasive. Okay? But, man, our team is a bit tired, but boy -- and I talked about it in my prepared remarks intentionally. Our frontline workers are the folks at the factories. I\u2019m always proud of our folks. The folks we have on the factory floor today dealing with this stuff every hour, every day, what they\u2019ve done and given us the ability to -- at the beginning of the year, Adam, we talked about revenue being $26 billion. In December, we took that up to like $26.5 billion, $26.7 billion. And if we\u2019re fortunate enough that the world doesn\u2019t go completely haywire in the next 60 to 75 days, and we\u2019re close to the midpoint of guidance for 4Q, we\u2019ll do over $26 billion this year. I think, the numbers are coming in around $26.2 billion. That\u2019s all -- that\u2019s all our people at factories who are just amazing to me, especially through all this, because they are exhausted. I think what we\u2019ll try to do our best is, in September and I refrained or stayed away from in my prepared remarks, I forget exactly what I said, but I didn\u2019t really call it a formal Investor Day, because I just don\u2019t know what the world\u2019s going to look, either it is as Mike or Adam. But we felt like it\u2019s important in September to go beyond a normal earnings call and try to lay out for you in a very descriptive way, how we see the world and we\u2019ll provide you a fairly comprehensive assumption set. Man, I think -- and I say this all the time, and I said it for the four or five-year journey we\u2019ve been on, the Company is diversified and our diversification in terms of our top-line, it\u2019s somewhat kind of the main deal here in allowing us to hold revenue at what I think is a very, very solid level, all things considered. And again, in the most simplistic terms and you alluded to this with the opening of your question, which is, if COVID would have never occurred, I think sitting here as a leadership team, we feel very good that we would have delivered the 980.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much, and congratulations on all the agility and hard work for your teams. Maybe a bigger strategic question. As we look at the world getting back post coronavirus, are there changes for more like localized manufacturing just from customers wanting to mitigate risk, meaning not be so concentrated in certain regions? And if so, I assume you probably have to talk about profitability, because putting together something in St. Petersburg may have a different cost profile than putting it together in a different country and then shipping it from the lowest cost, may be a little more expensive. But, can you kind of talking about are you seeing that having discussions, and does that really impact your profitability?\nMark Mondello: Could you clarify for me, so are you asking are we seeing -- specifically, are you saying are we seeing people, are they moving business around, are they moving business out of China, or is business moving back to the U.S.? Are you asking all of those or one of the three?\nJim Suva: Yes, kind of just in general, are those discussions happening and are they material or are they -- could you just kind of -- we read about the protocol trade wars, then we layer on a pandemic of health care on top of it. I\u2019m just wondering, if this is facilitating less of a concentrated footprint, Jabil has a very strong worldwide footprint. And if so, I assume that you have to have some discussions about costs, just kind of overall the topic. That\u2019s all.\nMark Mondello: Okay. So, I\u2019ll give it my best. I think -- I don\u2019t recall, I think it was the September call where we were in this trade tariff deal. That was kind of the headlines of the day and then COVID took over and trade tariffs just kind of taken the backseat, at least in terms of headlines. I believe what we said is, is there would be some cost -- our budgeting, if you will, for FY20 had suggested that the first half of \u201820, there was cost in there around trade tariffs as some customers were looking to hedge China. Not a lot of customers were leaving China. In fact, as we sit today, not a lot of customers that left China. We\u2019ve had a number of customers that had hedged China on new products. And that\u2019s played out largely as we thought, give or take. So then, COVID hit. And I would say, everything\u2019s been in a little bit of lockup in terms of conversations with customers strategically because customers are just trying to figure out which way is up as are we. So, I -- if I had to think about maybe the discussion in September that\u2019s a little bit more strategic, I would say not a lot changed since what we said September of 2019, at the beginning of this year. I think people will be a little bit more cautious in terms of having their product built as single site. That could be trade tariffs. That could be just because that could be because of Mother Nature concerns. I don\u2019t know how much of that links to COVID. The good news and all that Jim is boy oh boy, I\u2019m a real believer that there\u2019s a lot of stuff that will need to be built that few of us on the planet today that have large scale have a huge advantage. I put our footprint in that for sure. Mike talked about our balance sheet and the liquidity we have in terms of continuing to invest and then just overall leveraging supply chain. So, as these dynamics ebb and flow, as they change, I think we\u2019re in a reasonably good position.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details, and congratulations to you and all your employees.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Coster of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Chung: Hi. This is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking our questions. So, first, just on DMS, can you give us a sense for the relative strength between health care, packaging and mobility? From your prepared remarks, they strength seems quite broad, but judging by your unchanged fiscal year guide for this segment, assume health care was a largest driver, which obviously makes sense. But, if you could comment there and how these trends extend into in 4Q? And then, I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: Okay. I would -- so I think what you asked is, is kind of a breakdown to DMS strengths, weaknesses. I would say, tactically and maybe strategically, depending on how the whole new world order is post-COVID, both Mike and I spoke in our prepared remarks on I think companies are going to do things a bit differently going forward. I had the good fortune to talk to lots of our customers and their CEOs and lots of conversation around, geez, are you going to travel as much, are you going to conduct business the same? I think, our new normal as a proxy is I don\u2019t want to give one inkling of -- as I said in my prepared remarks, care and intimacy for customers. So, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ll spend our travel dollars. I think, net-net, our travel dollars on an annual basis have come down. I think, we\u2019ll use more digital tools. I bring all of that up because I think when it comes to our mobility business and our edge device business, and people using digital tools and working remotely for an extended period of time, I think that business will be in relatively good shape. And then, health care and packaging, both with our strategic plan around health care, and then with doing some PPE, I think we\u2019re getting a little bit of an extra boost there. I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers, but if you, for lack of better word on the chart that we provided in September, the blue green chart, I think, we had health care packaging for FY19 as just a little over $3 billion. And now the health care packaging is a little over $4 billion. And I would say, if things continue to go well for us, I see health care and packaging at a number greater than the 4 or $4.2 billion that you might see on the charts today.\nPaul Chung: Got you. And then, just a quick follow-up on health care, specifically about elective surgeries and other products of that nature that are kind of related to COVID spurred demand. How did those products do in the quarter? And do you see ramps from maybe pent up demand possibly in the coming quarter? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. I would say, from our observations, so don\u2019t take this is -- again, a data point for the industry, but from our vantage point, elective surgery demand was down. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any secret. I think that -- but yet on a net-net basis, we saw strength in health care. So, what you could surmise from that is there was a strong offset to our health care business. So, elective surgery demand down, both PPE and other areas of our health care were actually greater than the downtick we saw in elective surgeries on a net-net basis for 3Q. Here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting. I think an observation might be, geez, over time, maybe the PPE starts to fall off a little bit. How does that impact health care? Again, we\u2019ll talk about that in September. But, I also believe that there\u2019s going to be a significant pent up demand for elective surgeries, because a lot of these elective surgeries don\u2019t go away, just logistically people can\u2019t get them done in the middle of COVID. So the puts and takes on that are, if you look at our health care packaging business for fiscal \u201818, then you move to \u201819, then you move to \u201820, \u201821 and \u201822, I think that sector of our business is on a really good trajectory.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Thank you. Good morning. Just following up on some of those comments, Mark, can you maybe step back and talk about the progress you\u2019ve made during this period in improving the margins on some of the health care programs and maybe broadly as well? And then, just as a follow-up, could you talk about some of the consumer packaging trends? You mentioned the pickup in that. I know you were sort of improving sort of the operations of that business going into the COVID pandemic. And so, is this -- is there a longer term adjustment we should think about with that business going forward? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: So, in terms of margins in health care, I think, we talked about that in September. We talked about the addition, the wonderful strategic addition of JJMD. We gave you guys some color around that. If you go back and look at our comments in September, I think those still hold. So, we talked about a multiyear transition with JJMD, both with top line, bottom line margins. I think that is in -- tracking, likely expected in September. And I envision that tracking back on that same path as we move to fiscal \u201821 and \u201822. So net-net, I think that\u2019s positive. In terms of our consumer packaging business, Brenda who runs that for us has a just a ton of experience. And, although that business historically in the big picture of Jabil hasn\u2019t been overly material, I think it will be, not just thinking about top line, but bottom line, I think that has potential to be a margin-rich environment for us. And with Brenda and her team, the things they\u2019re looking at is the stickiness and/or how to lead with technology and engineering in a market that in many ways is just simplistic molding. That\u2019s not the area we\u2019re playing in. So, if I think about the trajectory of that business, I\u2019m every bit as bullish on that, if not more, than my bullishness around health care. And then, Steve, in terms of margins in general, obviously, margins this year have been handicapped by COVID. But, I think it was Adam who was asking the questions and prompting the discussion around, geez, top lines holding pretty good, again proxy for our diversification. If you can kind of handicap for the COVID cost, I think margins this year -- I think at the beginning of the year, we said that -- last year, last couple of years margins have been 3.4%, 3.5%. I think, net-net, COVID this year, if you adjust, I think this year we would have done, again the 3.6%, 3.7%. And we will talk in September about how we\u2019re thinking about margins for \u201821. And I do recognize that we have a guidepost out there of the $4 a share and 4% that we\u2019ll address that in another couple of months.\nSteven Fox: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nMark Mondello: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. And you may want to address, I\u2019m sure some of this in September. But I\u2019m curious, when you look at the revenue that was generated even beyond health care, because you\u2019ve talked about it significantly, during the quarter from increased demand for COVID. So, whether it was some of the work from home or some of the packaging and that, I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is what\u2019s the underlying business is. Were there some pockets of strength that surprised you, even beyond what you saw that -- I don\u2019t want to say they\u2019re one timers but obviously there\u2019s been sort of a shift in where production has been. So, I\u2019m curious, in 5G or some of the other areas, are you seeing incremental strength that\u2019s sort of driving the fundamentals even beyond the upside that you saw from COVID? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Areas I was surprised in, I would say that the uptick we had around COVID directly for health care was probably stronger than we anticipated, if we go back to the March call. Is that sustainable? I think, it\u2019s going to be sustainable for a while at some point that runs its course, starts to fall off. But then my comment about elective surgeries and things that are pent-up, I think feel a little bit of that pivot. So, maybe that was a little bit of a surprise. Our cloud business was kind of as expected. We saw good continued strength there. But, that was more on the expected side. I would say, the other area of surprise for us, or at least speaking for me, I don\u2019t want to speak for the whole management team is, I think, maybe we underestimated how broad based this digital learning, digital schools and video conferencing would be, especially when you consider COVID, you just grossly underestimate the impact of the whole world. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be so temporary. So, I mentioned it in one of the responses earlier. So, in terms of our edge device business, things that -- anything to do with people communicating differently, I think as human beings, connection is really, really important. So, people are going to want to -- whether it\u2019s augmented reality, WebEx, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, whatever tools people are using, they\u2019re going to want to have tools that continue to advance and allow them to have a level of really good human connection. So, any device that has to do with that being maybe part of the new normal, I thought -- I think we saw some upside in that in 3Q. I think, we\u2019ll continue to see some strength in that in the fourth quarter. And, my guess is, that strength will carry on through \u201821 and beyond.\nShannon Cross: And I was just curious on 3D printing technology in terms of manufacturing. Are you seeing more interest in that or was it sort of a nice to have because of the need for some of the PPE and that that they generated? Because I know you\u2019ve been one of the leaders in manufacturing with 3D?\nMark Mondello: I would never -- as we sit today, never characterized 3D as a nice to have. I think 3D additive is finally that technology -- forget about COVID, I think that technology is a secular trend in certain areas. And I think we\u2019re going to be leaning hard into that, especially in areas of health care, defense and aerospace, and automotive to start.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Matt Sheerin, Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: My question, Mark, regarding the $50 million in incremental costs cutting moves that you mentioned this morning. Could you talk again about sort of the reasoning for that? Are there certain end markets within EMS or DMS that you expect just a slower growth rate in your adjusting, or are there some mix issues as well?\nMark Mondello: It\u2019s got nothing to do with any of that. So, throughout my long time at Jabil, we go through different pockets in the Company where growth rates change, they\u2019re up, they\u2019re down. We went through a significant growth for nearly doubling the size of the company over a fairly short period of time. I think every four or five years, I think it\u2019s important for leadership teams to really reflect on what\u2019s worked well, what hasn\u2019t worked well. What we can do better; said differently, being adaptable and flexible to change. I think, our org structure that we had in place the last four, five, six years has served us really well, hence the tremendous growth. And so, we actually started talking in our strategic discussions in the call about, okay, what\u2019s next in terms of the next three, four years in the Company? We\u2019ve done a wonderful job of diversifying our top-line. We\u2019ve made it clear to investors that our focus -- we\u2019re going to take a little bit of -- a slight pause, a deep breath and focus hard on the cash flows and the margins. As such, pre-COVID, we were having lots of discussions about how to optimize the structure, how to remove any friction points in a company this size, how to be sure that everybody has access seamlessly and quickly to all of our capabilities. So, this was underway through the fall and into the winter. And then, COVID hit and added to our thinking around maybe taking some cost out of the business. So, it\u2019s not really a reaction. I think, Mike and I both said in our prepared remarks, 3Q provided us some pockets of strength that was offset in a few pockets of weakness. This action has nothing to do with any of that. It just had to do -- it\u2019s more structural in nature, it\u2019s more permanent. I could suggest to you these costs aren\u2019t going to come back when COVID is over. And I really like how it positions the Company for \u201821- \u201822 and beyond. The decision point we had to make as a leadership team is with everybody working remotely, did we think this would be a good time to go do this because things like this are not easy. And we made a decision to do it because if we can do it properly and get through the other side of this with the new structure as COVID starts to clear up, I think it gives us a really, really nice foundation to run the Company.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. That was very helpful. And just as my follow-up, Mike, regarding the balance sheet. It looks like your inventory days were down sequentially, which is credible -- certainly taking into account the supply constraints that you and your customers saw. You\u2019re still up year-over-year. In terms of where you think that inventory is pointed directionally, do you expect to stay somewhat elevated as customers look to keep some buffer stocks? Are there still supply constraints? Or do you see that coming down over time?\nMark Mondello: So, in Q2, Matt, the inventory shut up to 70 days. I think we had some issues in China. There wasn\u2019t anything being shipped out. So, the 70 days was unnaturally high. We\u2019ve come down to 67 this quarter. So, progress, but not as much as I would have liked to see. So, my target right now is let\u2019s get to that 60; in the medium to long-term, we need to be in the mid to low -- mid to high 50s. So, that\u2019s the eventual target. Will we get that right away next quarter? The answer is no. But, over time, I feel good that we will get there.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to better understand if Jabil is able to pass on maybe extra cost from COVID mitigation to customers on your existing projects. And are these costs related to COVID mitigation factor into the pricing discussion you\u2019re having for new business?\nMark Mondello: Hey, Mark. The $160 million to $170 million for the year I spoke to the net cost. So, those conversations are going on all the time. Over our 400-plus relationships, 80%, 90% of those are highly strategic long-term. And those conversations, they have endless dimensions to them. So, let\u2019s just say that we\u2019ve got a business to run. Our customers understand we have a business to run. We also want to be very, very thoughtful to all of our customers because they\u2019re going through tough times as well. But, be rest assured that I think those discussions for the most part that have taken place through the third quarter and will continue through 4Q and into \u201821, I would characterize as being very fair conversation.\nMark Delaney: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. My second question, on the last earnings report, the Company didn\u2019t have enough visibility to provide guidance, and there was uncertainties at that time related to both, production and customer demands. And on this call, you\u2019ve already spoken at length about how the production side has improved in terms of component availability and factory utilization. I was hoping to better understand the demand side of the equation, and not so much in terms of different end markets and what you\u2019re seeing, but just the visibility that you have into customer demand and ordering and how much visibility has improved and how that maybe led to your comfort in being able to provide guidance as we sit today for this call? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: So, let me try it this way. The processes and the tools and the analytics we use for understanding demand haven\u2019t changed at all. And in fact, I really -- I\u2019m glad we have the tools and the analytics we have because they\u2019re helpful when the horizon gets a bit foggy. Those tools are helpful. I would say that -- so, net-net, the visibility we have is unchanged, the issue is, how much our data analytics and our resources align or misalign with some customers\u2019 outlooks. And I think that\u2019s where the tools are most beneficial, because if there\u2019s a disconnect from what we\u2019re seeing or we believe we should be seeing versus the feeds that we\u2019re getting, the demand feeds, it\u2019s driving lots of really constructive conversations. I think that there\u2019s still going to be quite a bit of choppiness in the business, through the fourth quarter and into early FY21. I think that to have this feeling like COVID is behind us, the stock market\u2019s doing great, the world\u2019s getting back on its feet, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. With that said, the reason we decided to give guidance for the fourth quarter is, we\u2019ve tried our best to handicap multiple scenarios. We\u2019ve kind of taken an average of say a dozen or so different scenarios. And I think we have a degree of confidence that justifies the guidance for the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Muller of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRobert Muller: Hi. Can you just talk a little bit about your share purchase and allocation plans? Do you plan on resuming the pays that you expected pre-COVID, and if so, by what timeframe? And are there any rough targets for when you\u2019d like to exhaust your authorization?\nMike Dastoor: We do have a $600 million authorization out there. We\u2019ve done about 190 of that already. We\u2019re going to continue to be sort of thoughtful on our capital allocation, the opportunistic -- I do want to balance buybacks with cash and make sure that our balance sheet is in a very strong position, which it is today. So, the answer is, we will be looking at it opportunistically for sure.\nRobert Muller: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you for joining us. Please reach out to us with any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect your lines or logoff the webcast at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by providing a brief business update before turning the call over to Mike, where he'll offer details on our Q3 performance and address our guidance for the balance of the year. So, before I get into the business at hand, I'd like to extend a warm thanks to our people here at Jabil for their hard work and commitment, especially during these trying times. I tend to think that successful and sustainable organizations are evaluated not only on their ability to deal with what they can control, but also on their ability to react and adapt to the environment, especially in environments that shift suddenly and shift unexpectedly. To this, I give our team high marks. Their response to COVID-19 gives me confidence and demonstrates our resiliency. At Jabil, we help design, develop and bring to life numerous products, products that the world depends on. In many ways, this pandemic has reinforced that Jabil itself is an essential business. If I may, I'll now take you back to our second fiscal quarter for proper context specific to COVID. As our teams in China attempted to return from Chinese New Year in mid-February, they were faced with travel lockdowns, quarantines, and the need for social distancing. Add to this the fact that our sites in China were operating at less than 50% capacity. Given the ambiguity that was fast unfolding, we rescinded our financial outlook for the fiscal year. As we moved into the third quarter, COVID quickly spread impacting regions and countries that are home to our many factories. March quickly turned into April and April to May. And while many of us were hunkered down, following stay-at-home orders, transforming kitchens or bedrooms or garages into new found workspaces, our factories by and large continued to build and ship product. Most importantly, throughout it all, the global incident rate of confirmed COVID cases across Jabil remained remarkably low. I want to offer a special thanks to all of our frontline workers, those of you that work so hard in keeping our people safe, while taking amazing care of our customers directly from the factory floor, your ability to execute and perform has been nothing short of spectacular. And on top of it all, together, you created a COVID playbook that we use today across all sites, a playbook of protocols and best practices that we openly share with suppliers, customers, communities and competitors. Moving on to the critical business catalysts for the quarter. We saw strong demand in health care and packaging, cloud, edge devices and mobility. In our health care sector, we joined the fight against COVID as it was simply the right thing to do. Our teams quickly transformed manufacturing lines around the world, contributing to the production of critical products, such as ventilators, specialized manifolds, 3D printed components, face shields, protective masks and test kits. In terms of our packaging business, which serves many of the world's top consumer brands, demand was strong in areas like cleaners and disinfectants, touch-less dispensers, antibacterial products, and eat-at-home food products. At the same time, internet usage was exploding, prompted by remote learning and video conferencing. Teams from our cloud sector along with the teams from our mobility and edge device sectors were in full-blown customer care mode as end users sought digital access to family, friends, business colleagues and patients, a trend likely to be part of the world's new normal. During the quarter, these areas of strength were offset by weakness in our automotive and transport, and print & retail sectors. Nonetheless, our well-diversified commercial portfolio allowed us to deliver $6.3 billion in revenue, in line with our expectation. To me, this is quite meaningful. With each passing year, the blend of our revenues becomes better balanced and far less dependent on any single product or product family. Quite simply, greater diversification increases the reliability of our revenue. Having said this, and as we sit here today, the impact of COVID will cost us roughly $160 million to $170 million for fiscal year \u201820. Therefore, we're taking aggressive actions to reshape the organization and ready ourselves for fiscal \u201821. We'll reduce our workforce and in return lower our cost structure by roughly $50 million. I'll now take a minute and express my appreciation for those impacted by this difficult decision, yet a decision that's correct for the business. In taking this decision, we've done our very best to ensure that everyone is treated with complete respect, care and dignity. As we make our way through the summer months, there's considerable work ahead as we prepare to host a call with investors, this coming September. For lack of a better description, we look at this call as having a conversation with investors, a conversation about how Jabil management is thinking about fiscal \u201821 during these uncertain times. It's important to note that throughout this macro uncertainty, we remain steadfast in prioritizing free cash flow and expanding core operating margins. In closing, you can be assured that we're navigating today's issues, while being thoughtful about tomorrow's challenges. Looking ahead, I believe our business landscape and how we choose to conduct our business may look and feel a bit different, it'll possibly be more efficient, it'll possibly be more optimized. I think, this can have real benefits as long as we don't lose a single ounce of our customer intimacy or customer care. Also, I believe key secular trends will remain and remain in our favor. Lastly, plenty of stuff will still need to be built and building stuff is exactly what we do. Thank you. I'll now hand the call over to Mike. Sure, Ruplu? I think, what I'd prefer to do is get into some of that detail during our discussion in September. I mentioned on the prepared remarks, even in this crazy environment, we're going to do our best to get together with all investors in September and at least just let you know how we're thinking about everything for fiscal \u201821. On the surface today, I'd be careful not to -- and I know you didn't mean this, but for the group, right, I'd be careful not to interchange DMS with JGP. Our DMS business, again, is -- got a number of components to it. I would -- if I had to think about what we may say in September is, with the shape of our Green Point business, with the shape of mobility, with our significant diversification inside of JGP. And then, you add to it the tremendous growth we've had in the health care packaging side, I would say over time that maybe some of the cyclicality you saw in the business specific to DMS two, three years ago will flatten out a bit. I'd characterize it this way, just so just have some relativity. If let's say, pre COVID, let's say the supply chain activity behavior pre COVID December-January timeframe was a 10, I think we hit our biggest, divot probably in the March-April timeframe, I'd call that maybe a 5 to 6. I'd say today, we're back to an 8 or 9. And I think it stays there until we get to the backside of COVID, whenever that is. Yes. Thanks, Ruplu. All right. Adam, I'll take a shot at it and if I don't get it right, come back at me. So, I think, pre-COVID, so let's take -- let's go way back to September. In September, I think we said for FY20, we do $960 million in core income, then I think in the December call, we took that up to $980 million, if I remember correctly. And today, we're sitting with the model, if you take midpoint of Q4, we're about $805 million, something like that, give or take. So, if I go back -- let's not go back all the way to September, I don't think that's fair because we took the numbers up in December. So, go to the December number, call it $980 million, today we're at $805 million, the delta's 175. And I think in my prepared remarks, I said that COVID-related costs would be -- for the year, would be a 160 to 170. So, the gap between December and now, 175, COVID related, call it 160 to 170. The rest of it is almost immaterial and a bunch of puts and takes, and noise. In terms of the COVID expense specifically, we talked a little bit about this in March when we talked about a $53 million charge in February alone. I think the nice thing that is happening here is the March call we did -- we had a $53 million charge to COVID, largely in partial February. So, on a monthly basis, we were -- COVID was costing us $60 million, $65 million a month. Then we moved to April, May, June timeframe. I think, Mike alluded to it, in Q3, COVID was about $60 million, give or take. And then, I think Mike in his prepared remarks was suggesting that COVID for Q4 would be $50 million. So, the nice thing is, touch wood, today, trends coming down a bit. I think that has to do with the fact that we're becoming more optimized in our process and protocols, getting people in and out of factories. By the way, with our number one objective is at all of our factories keeping them safe. And then, how those costs break out, Adam, is we have direct costs which is largely around our protocols, temperature testing, PPE around all of our factories, very consistent to our COVID playbook, again, protocols, processes. Then we've had some disruptions in 3Q in terms of either government shutting down factories, states shutting down factories. Where we've had some confirmed COVID cases, we closed our factories until we can get testing completed. Through all that, we're paying the idle labor. I think that's the right thing to do in this time and place. And then also, we're just -- just general pockets of disruption. So, today, our entire factory networks running at call it 90%, 95% and I think revenue reflects that. But, that could lead to the question of Gee, factory networks seem to be running at a normalized pace, why still the COVID costs? And the truth is, 3Q and we anticipate in 4Q, we'll still have some one-off pockets of disruption, and we've kind of tried to handicap that as best we could for the fourth quarter. Let's talk about that in September. And I say that not -- I don't want to be evasive. Okay? But, man, our team is a bit tired, but boy -- and I talked about it in my prepared remarks intentionally. Our frontline workers are the folks at the factories. I'm always proud of our folks. The folks we have on the factory floor today dealing with this stuff every hour, every day, what they've done and given us the ability to -- at the beginning of the year, Adam, we talked about revenue being $26 billion. In December, we took that up to like $26.5 billion, $26.7 billion. And if we're fortunate enough that the world doesn't go completely haywire in the next 60 to 75 days, and we're close to the midpoint of guidance for 4Q, we'll do over $26 billion this year. I think, the numbers are coming in around $26.2 billion. That's all -- that's all our people at factories who are just amazing to me, especially through all this, because they are exhausted. I think what we'll try to do our best is, in September and I refrained or stayed away from in my prepared remarks, I forget exactly what I said, but I didn't really call it a formal Investor Day, because I just don't know what the world's going to look, either it is as Mike or Adam. But we felt like it's important in September to go beyond a normal earnings call and try to lay out for you in a very descriptive way, how we see the world and we'll provide you a fairly comprehensive assumption set. Man, I think -- and I say this all the time, and I said it for the four or five-year journey we've been on, the Company is diversified and our diversification in terms of our top-line, it's somewhat kind of the main deal here in allowing us to hold revenue at what I think is a very, very solid level, all things considered. And again, in the most simplistic terms and you alluded to this with the opening of your question, which is, if COVID would have never occurred, I think sitting here as a leadership team, we feel very good that we would have delivered the 980. Could you clarify for me, so are you asking are we seeing -- specifically, are you saying are we seeing people, are they moving business around, are they moving business out of China, or is business moving back to the U.S.? Are you asking all of those or one of the three? Okay. So, I'll give it my best. I think -- I don't recall, I think it was the September call where we were in this trade tariff deal. That was kind of the headlines of the day and then COVID took over and trade tariffs just kind of taken the backseat, at least in terms of headlines. I believe what we said is, is there would be some cost -- our budgeting, if you will, for FY20 had suggested that the first half of \u201820, there was cost in there around trade tariffs as some customers were looking to hedge China. Not a lot of customers were leaving China. In fact, as we sit today, not a lot of customers that left China. We've had a number of customers that had hedged China on new products. And that's played out largely as we thought, give or take. So then, COVID hit. And I would say, everything's been in a little bit of lockup in terms of conversations with customers strategically because customers are just trying to figure out which way is up as are we. So, I -- if I had to think about maybe the discussion in September that's a little bit more strategic, I would say not a lot changed since what we said September of 2019, at the beginning of this year. I think people will be a little bit more cautious in terms of having their product built as single site. That could be trade tariffs. That could be just because that could be because of Mother Nature concerns. I don't know how much of that links to COVID. The good news and all that Jim is boy oh boy, I'm a real believer that there's a lot of stuff that will need to be built that few of us on the planet today that have large scale have a huge advantage. I put our footprint in that for sure. Mike talked about our balance sheet and the liquidity we have in terms of continuing to invest and then just overall leveraging supply chain. So, as these dynamics ebb and flow, as they change, I think we're in a reasonably good position. Thanks, Jim. Okay. I would -- so I think what you asked is, is kind of a breakdown to DMS strengths, weaknesses. I would say, tactically and maybe strategically, depending on how the whole new world order is post-COVID, both Mike and I spoke in our prepared remarks on I think companies are going to do things a bit differently going forward. I had the good fortune to talk to lots of our customers and their CEOs and lots of conversation around, geez, are you going to travel as much, are you going to conduct business the same? I think, our new normal as a proxy is I don't want to give one inkling of -- as I said in my prepared remarks, care and intimacy for customers. So, I think that's where we'll spend our travel dollars. I think, net-net, our travel dollars on an annual basis have come down. I think, we'll use more digital tools. I bring all of that up because I think when it comes to our mobility business and our edge device business, and people using digital tools and working remotely for an extended period of time, I think that business will be in relatively good shape. And then, health care and packaging, both with our strategic plan around health care, and then with doing some PPE, I think we're getting a little bit of an extra boost there. I don't remember the exact numbers, but if you, for lack of better word on the chart that we provided in September, the blue green chart, I think, we had health care packaging for FY19 as just a little over $3 billion. And now the health care packaging is a little over $4 billion. And I would say, if things continue to go well for us, I see health care and packaging at a number greater than the 4 or $4.2 billion that you might see on the charts today. Yes. I would say, from our observations, so don't take this is -- again, a data point for the industry, but from our vantage point, elective surgery demand was down. I don't think that's any secret. I think that -- but yet on a net-net basis, we saw strength in health care. So, what you could surmise from that is there was a strong offset to our health care business. So, elective surgery demand down, both PPE and other areas of our health care were actually greater than the downtick we saw in elective surgeries on a net-net basis for 3Q. Here's what's interesting. I think an observation might be, geez, over time, maybe the PPE starts to fall off a little bit. How does that impact health care? Again, we'll talk about that in September. But, I also believe that there's going to be a significant pent up demand for elective surgeries, because a lot of these elective surgeries don't go away, just logistically people can't get them done in the middle of COVID. So the puts and takes on that are, if you look at our health care packaging business for fiscal \u201818, then you move to \u201819, then you move to \u201820, \u201821 and \u201822, I think that sector of our business is on a really good trajectory. So, in terms of margins in health care, I think, we talked about that in September. We talked about the addition, the wonderful strategic addition of JJMD. We gave you guys some color around that. If you go back and look at our comments in September, I think those still hold. So, we talked about a multiyear transition with JJMD, both with top line, bottom line margins. I think that is in -- tracking, likely expected in September. And I envision that tracking back on that same path as we move to fiscal \u201821 and \u201822. So net-net, I think that's positive. In terms of our consumer packaging business, Brenda who runs that for us has a just a ton of experience. And, although that business historically in the big picture of Jabil hasn't been overly material, I think it will be, not just thinking about top line, but bottom line, I think that has potential to be a margin-rich environment for us. And with Brenda and her team, the things they're looking at is the stickiness and/or how to lead with technology and engineering in a market that in many ways is just simplistic molding. That's not the area we're playing in. So, if I think about the trajectory of that business, I'm every bit as bullish on that, if not more, than my bullishness around health care. And then, Steve, in terms of margins in general, obviously, margins this year have been handicapped by COVID. But, I think it was Adam who was asking the questions and prompting the discussion around, geez, top lines holding pretty good, again proxy for our diversification. If you can kind of handicap for the COVID cost, I think margins this year -- I think at the beginning of the year, we said that -- last year, last couple of years margins have been 3.4%, 3.5%. I think, net-net, COVID this year, if you adjust, I think this year we would have done, again the 3.6%, 3.7%. And we will talk in September about how we're thinking about margins for \u201821. And I do recognize that we have a guidepost out there of the $4 a share and 4% that we'll address that in another couple of months. Yes. Areas I was surprised in, I would say that the uptick we had around COVID directly for health care was probably stronger than we anticipated, if we go back to the March call. Is that sustainable? I think, it's going to be sustainable for a while at some point that runs its course, starts to fall off. But then my comment about elective surgeries and things that are pent-up, I think feel a little bit of that pivot. So, maybe that was a little bit of a surprise. Our cloud business was kind of as expected. We saw good continued strength there. But, that was more on the expected side. I would say, the other area of surprise for us, or at least speaking for me, I don't want to speak for the whole management team is, I think, maybe we underestimated how broad based this digital learning, digital schools and video conferencing would be, especially when you consider COVID, you just grossly underestimate the impact of the whole world. And I don't think that's going to be so temporary. So, I mentioned it in one of the responses earlier. So, in terms of our edge device business, things that -- anything to do with people communicating differently, I think as human beings, connection is really, really important. So, people are going to want to -- whether it's augmented reality, WebEx, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, whatever tools people are using, they're going to want to have tools that continue to advance and allow them to have a level of really good human connection. So, any device that has to do with that being maybe part of the new normal, I thought -- I think we saw some upside in that in 3Q. I think, we'll continue to see some strength in that in the fourth quarter. And, my guess is, that strength will carry on through \u201821 and beyond. I would never -- as we sit today, never characterized 3D as a nice to have. I think 3D additive is finally that technology -- forget about COVID, I think that technology is a secular trend in certain areas. And I think we're going to be leaning hard into that, especially in areas of health care, defense and aerospace, and automotive to start. It's got nothing to do with any of that. So, throughout my long time at Jabil, we go through different pockets in the Company where growth rates change, they're up, they're down. We went through a significant growth for nearly doubling the size of the company over a fairly short period of time. I think every four or five years, I think it's important for leadership teams to really reflect on what's worked well, what hasn't worked well. What we can do better; said differently, being adaptable and flexible to change. I think, our org structure that we had in place the last four, five, six years has served us really well, hence the tremendous growth. And so, we actually started talking in our strategic discussions in the call about, okay, what's next in terms of the next three, four years in the Company? We've done a wonderful job of diversifying our top-line. We've made it clear to investors that our focus -- we're going to take a little bit of -- a slight pause, a deep breath and focus hard on the cash flows and the margins. As such, pre-COVID, we were having lots of discussions about how to optimize the structure, how to remove any friction points in a company this size, how to be sure that everybody has access seamlessly and quickly to all of our capabilities. So, this was underway through the fall and into the winter. And then, COVID hit and added to our thinking around maybe taking some cost out of the business. So, it's not really a reaction. I think, Mike and I both said in our prepared remarks, 3Q provided us some pockets of strength that was offset in a few pockets of weakness. This action has nothing to do with any of that. It just had to do -- it's more structural in nature, it's more permanent. I could suggest to you these costs aren't going to come back when COVID is over. And I really like how it positions the Company for \u201821- \u201822 and beyond. The decision point we had to make as a leadership team is with everybody working remotely, did we think this would be a good time to go do this because things like this are not easy. And we made a decision to do it because if we can do it properly and get through the other side of this with the new structure as COVID starts to clear up, I think it gives us a really, really nice foundation to run the Company. So, in Q2, Matt, the inventory shut up to 70 days. I think we had some issues in China. There wasn't anything being shipped out. So, the 70 days was unnaturally high. We've come down to 67 this quarter. So, progress, but not as much as I would have liked to see. So, my target right now is let's get to that 60; in the medium to long-term, we need to be in the mid to low -- mid to high 50s. So, that's the eventual target. Will we get that right away next quarter? The answer is no. But, over time, I feel good that we will get there. Hey, Mark. The $160 million to $170 million for the year I spoke to the net cost. So, those conversations are going on all the time. Over our 400-plus relationships, 80%, 90% of those are highly strategic long-term. And those conversations, they have endless dimensions to them. So, let's just say that we've got a business to run. Our customers understand we have a business to run. We also want to be very, very thoughtful to all of our customers because they're going through tough times as well. But, be rest assured that I think those discussions for the most part that have taken place through the third quarter and will continue through 4Q and into \u201821, I would characterize as being very fair conversation. So, let me try it this way. The processes and the tools and the analytics we use for understanding demand haven't changed at all. And in fact, I really -- I'm glad we have the tools and the analytics we have because they're helpful when the horizon gets a bit foggy. Those tools are helpful. I would say that -- so, net-net, the visibility we have is unchanged, the issue is, how much our data analytics and our resources align or misalign with some customers' outlooks. And I think that's where the tools are most beneficial, because if there's a disconnect from what we're seeing or we believe we should be seeing versus the feeds that we're getting, the demand feeds, it's driving lots of really constructive conversations. I think that there's still going to be quite a bit of choppiness in the business, through the fourth quarter and into early FY21. I think that to have this feeling like COVID is behind us, the stock market's doing great, the world's getting back on its feet, I don't think that's the case. With that said, the reason we decided to give guidance for the fourth quarter is, we've tried our best to handicap multiple scenarios. We've kind of taken an average of say a dozen or so different scenarios. And I think we have a degree of confidence that justifies the guidance for the fourth quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I cover our Q3 financial results, I thought it would be helpful to provide a brief update on how COVID-19 has impacted our business and the end markets we serve since we last spoke on March 13th. Following our call in March, COVID-19 quickly spread across the globe. However, as Mark indicated, for most of the quarter, our operations managed to remain largely open. Our teams were the local authorities and a large majority of our factories were deemed essential, so that we continue to build and ship products throughout Q3. In fact, since the end of March, we have largely been operating at 95% capacity, despite a handful of one to two-week closures in areas like Malaysia, India, and California. Putting it all together, at an enterprise level, demand largely held in Q3. However, the makeup of this demand varied extensively by end market and region as the COVID-19 outbreak and stay-at-home orders around the world impacted each in a unique way. Let me walk you through what we're seeing in the different end markets today. Within mobility, the average out of season launch, which began in February is going extremely well. In tandem with this, the team has also started working on the launch for our upcoming seasonal next-gen mobility products, and this too is on track. Moving to edge devices and lifestyles. As more people work and learn from home, we're seeing good demand for certain products, such as tablets, headphones and smart watches. In health care, we're experiencing strong demand in the markets most critical in the fight against COVID-19, ventilators and ventilator splitters, oxygen, and temperature sensing equipment, diagnostic systems, including analyzers and test kits and masks ranging from protective face masks to reusable N95 masks. This trend is being offset by reduced demand for trauma and elective surgery products. Moving to packaging. As a reminder, our packaging business is a supplier to the world's leading consumer packaged goods companies. COVID-19 is exerting enormous pressure on our customers to ship unprecedented levels of cleaning and food products. Because of this, we're seeing increasing demand in packaging for laundry products, hard surface cleaners, touch-less dispensers and antibacterial wipes. In addition, we're also seeing good demand for food packaging spurred on by more people dining at home. Moving to EMS. Within automotive, our near-term results and outlook have been diminished due to lower forecasted worldwide unit sales and OEM factory closures. However, looking forward, we expect weakness in the traditional automotive markets to be partly offset by additional growth in electrification, which continues to gain overall share of this market. In semi-cap, we're seeing solid demand, driven by the ongoing recovery in this end market as infrastructure spending continues. New fab plant investments are multiyear investments. And so far, customers are marching ahead with their 2020 and 2021 roadmaps. In wireless and 5G, consistent with prior quarters, we continue to see growth in 5G that is being offset by 4G as the market transitions to newer technology. In the near term, we expect 5G infrastructure rollouts to continue as network operators upgrade their services. In cloud, our teams are seeing an increased demand for cloud infrastructure created by stay-at-home orders around the world, which is translating to higher growth. Moving to print and retail, we expect continued pressure in these end markets in the near term, driven mainly by office closures and stay-at-home orders. Turning now to industrial and energy. Demand has been relatively consistent to-date. But, moving forward, we are seeing signs of new building starts being delayed. This could have an impact on future demand. And then finally, within the enterprise end markets, we are seeing increased demand for networking products due to work-from-home dynamics, offset by cautious overall enterprise spread. We anticipate this demand dynamic to continue over the next few quarters. From a cost perspective, during Q3, we incurred approximately $60 million in direct and indirect costs associated with COVID-19 outbreak. The makeup of these costs consisted mainly of lower factory utilization due to lockdown restrictions, supply chain, inefficiencies and PP&E costs to keep our people safe. Turning now to our Q3 financial results. The combination of our ability to largely remain open, efficiently navigate sporadic factory shutdowns and the diverse nature of our end markets allowed us to deliver $6.3 billion in net revenue during the quarter, in line with internal forecast. To me, this is a meaningful and further illustration that our diversification strategy is working. GAAP operating income was $59 million and GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.34. Core operating income during the quarter was $172 million. Net interest expense during the quarter came in better-than-expected at $49 million due to better working capital efficiency and lower interest rates. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 53.7%. At the end of April, our non-U.S. entity's tax incentive was extended by the government for an additional 10 years, which resulted in revaluation of certain of those entities' deferred tax assets. While this resulted in a one-time charge of $21 million in Q3, moving forward, this tax incentive extension will continue to benefit our effective tax rate for another 10 years. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.37. It's worth noting that the reevaluation of deferred tax assets negatively impacted our core diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.14. Next, I'd like to call your attention to an item, which impacted our GAAP results during the quarter. Over the past three years, we've experienced tremendous growth, adding in excess of $7 billion in revenue to our results. Importantly, the growth has been intentional and targeted at end markets that offer accretive margin and cash flow profiles. With the success in diversifying the business, we feel, it is an appropriate time specially admits the current economic landscape to take steps to proactively optimize our cost structure and improve operational efficiencies. Therefore, during Q3, we've taken steps to reduce our worldwide workforce. For Q3 we incurred approximately $50 million related to this, inclusive of severance costs and extended health care benefits to those impacted. We anticipate these costs will result in a net benefit to core operating income of $40 million to $50 million in FY21. This is in addition to the anticipated savings associated with the 2020 restructuring plan we announced last September. Now, turning to our third quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $2.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year, while core operating income for the segment increased 27% year-over-year. This resulted in core margins expanding 30 basis points to 2.9%. Moving to EMS. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.9 billion, down 2% year-over-year. From an end market perspective, we saw year-over-year strength in the cloud and semi-cap space offset by declines in automotive print and retail. Core margins for the segment came in at 2.6%. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. As anticipated in Q3, inventory levels contracted sequentially, with our days in inventory coming in at 67 days, a decline of three days, quarter-over-quarter. Cash flows provided by operations were $487 million in Q3, and net capital expenditures totaled $143 million. As a result of the strong third quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for Q3 came in stronger than expected at approximately $344 million. It's worth noting, while we recorded approximately $50 million of expenses in Q3, associated with the aforementioned workforce reductions, the associated cash outflow will largely be in Q4. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.6 times and cash balances of $763 million. During Q3, we took steps to bolster our balance sheet adding over $625 million in liquidity, bringing our available committed capacity under the global credit facilities for $3.7 billion. With this additional capacity along with our quarter end cash balance, Jabil ended Q3 with access to more than $4.5 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility to navigate the current market environment, all while maintaining our investment grade rating. We repurchased approximately 800,000 shares for $21 million in Q3, bringing our total year-to-date repurchases to $190 million. Turning now to our fourth quarter guidance that includes approximately $45 million to $55 million in COVID-19-related costs. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 1% on a year-over-year basis to $2.5 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to decrease 8% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion. We expect total Company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $5.8 billion to $6.6 billion for a decrease of 5% at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $145 million to $245 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.86. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.04 to $0.50. Next, I'd like to outline our updated expectations for revenue in fiscal year \u201820 by end market. Within DMS, today's revenue outlook is largely unchanged. Our diversification within DMS continues to pay dividends even in the current environment. We expect core margins for DMS to be 3.8% for the fiscal year on revenue of approximately $10.3 billion. Turning now to EMS. Within EMS, we've reduced our revenue outlook for FY20s driven by automotive, industry and energy, and print & retail, which has been partially offset by continued strength in cloud. We expect margins for EMS to be 2.6% on the year on revenue of approximately $15.9 billion. Putting it all together for the year, we now anticipate revenues will be $26.2 billion and core operating income to be $805 million. This outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $2.60 for the year. We also expect to deliver free cash flows in the range of $400 million to $450 million for the fiscal year. Considering this outlook, to me, it's clear that our diversification strategy continues to work and has positioned us well to navigate an incredibly challenging market environment. In closing, I'm very proud of our Jabil team and their collective efforts over the past several months. Our early and focused efforts are working to protect the health and safety of our employees. And we continue to be vigilant in increasing our efforts in this area. I'm also very proud of the innovative ways in which Jabil's teams have collaborated to join the global fight against COVID-19. I'll now turn the call over to Adam. We do have a $600 million authorization out there. We've done about 190 of that already. We're going to continue to be sort of thoughtful on our capital allocation, the opportunistic -- I do want to balance buybacks with cash and make sure that our balance sheet is in a very strong position, which it is today. So, the answer is, we will be looking at it opportunistically for sure."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry, Vice President Investor Relations for Jabil. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's Second Quarter of Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the discussion and view the slides, you will need to be logged in to our webcast on jabil.com. At the end of today's call, both the presentation and a replay of the call will be available on Jabil's Investor Relations website. During today's call, we may be using forward-looking including, among other things, those regarding the outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our forward-looking statements and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Now before we begin, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss the agenda and objective for today's call. As a reminder, on February 25, 2020, we announced that the COVID-19 outbreak would negatively impact our second quarter results relative to the guidance that we had provided on December 17, 2019. And as forewarned, our second quarter results were, in fact, below our initial range of expectations, driven by approximately $53 million in direct costs associated with labor, supplies and supply chain inefficiencies, all caused by the disruptive impact of COVID-19. As customary, Mike will walk through our second quarter results, while also detailing the intra-quarter sequence of events that resulted in a material deceleration in earnings towards the end of the quarter. Although demand remains strong, and our manufacturing capacity continues to improve each day, the overall impact of COVID-19 on our business is still yet to be determined. Consequently, we're going to deviate from our standard quarterly call format in two distinct ways. First, we're currently not in a position to provide third quarter or fiscal 2020 guidance or outlooks for each of our end markets in fiscal 2020 as usual. Second, following Mike's prepared comments, we will move directly into Q&A in an effort to efficiently address your questions. We do, however, expect to resume to our normal cadence of call in the future. As Mark expressed in our press release on February 25, our first priority throughout this global pandemic has been the safety of our people. It simply makes sense to take care of our people, and we believe it's in the best interest of shareholders too. I can speak on behalf of everyone in this room when I thank all of those who jumped into action with a typical Jabil energy.  The team's swift response and hard work allowed us to be in a position to report our second quarter results today. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As Adam stated, our Q2 results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Before I cover our Q2 results, I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the dynamics that unfolded during the quarter. We began Q2 with a stronger-than-anticipated start to the fiscal quarter. As we moved into February, demand held, but our ability to meet demand was greatly diminished as virus containment efforts ramped in China. during the quarter, we incurred approximately $53 million in direct costs associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. I'd now like to provide you with the makeup of these costs. First, we incurred additional labor costs in Q2. During February, we strategically made the decision to compensate our employees who are restricted and quarantined. These factors contributed to higher labor costs than we expected going into the quarter. Second, our factory utilization in China was negatively impacted in February due to travel disruptions and restrictions. To add further context to the higher labor costs and lower utilization, February began with the Chinese New Year holiday being extended by 10 to 14 days depending on location. Most of our larger sites in China began to come back online later than anticipated. And by February 14, we were only operating at 45% to 50% capacity. We exited the quarter at approximately 80% utilization in China. Third, during the quarter, we also incurred lost revenue associated with both upstream and downstream supply chain disruptions, which impacted our worldwide footprint. And finally, in an effort to keep our employee base safe and healthy, we incurred unanticipated costs to procure necessary supplies to keep our people safe, items, such as face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and personal protection equipment. I would like to highlight that February was an anomaly. Under normal circumstances, if demand diminished, our variable costs would have been materially lower as we would have adjusted our costs to the demand environment. Turning now to our Q2 financial results. Net revenue for the second quarter was $6.1 billion. GAAP operating income was $91 million, and our GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.02. Core operating income during the quarter was $159 million. Net interest expense during the quarter was $52 million. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%, in-line with expectations. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.50. It's worth noting that the additional costs associated with the outbreak negatively impacted our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.25. Now moving to our GAAP results. As expected, we incurred $30 million in restructuring and severance-related charges in Q2, predominantly associated with the 2020 restructuring plan we announced in September of last year. This plan continues to remain on track and as a reminder, is expected to result in an incremental cost savings benefit of $25 million, mainly in the second half of FY20. Also during the quarter, we incurred a onetime non-cash impairment charge of approximately $12 million in connection with the sale of an investment in the optical networking segment. Now turning to our second quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $2.3 billion. From an end-market perspective, we experienced good demand in the health care and mobility end markets. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.8 billion. From an end-market perspective, we saw additional strength in the semi cap space, while demand in the balance of the business came in largely as expected. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. During Q2, our total days of inventory came in at 70 days, an increase of 13 days sequentially, driven mainly by idle capacity and supply chain constraints due to COVID-19. Higher inventory levels during the quarter were offset slightly by lower days of sales outstanding at the end of the quarter, driven mainly by lower February sales. Cash flows provided by operations were $63 million in Q2, and net capital expenditures totaled $205 million. We exited the quarter with a total debt to core EBITDA level of approximately 1.7x and cash balances of $697 million. Jabil has over $3 billion of global revolver credit facilities, and at the end of Q2, over 90% of these facilities were available. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $72 million as part of our two year, $600 million authorization we announced in September. In closing, as always, Jabil's No.1 priority is the health and well-being of our employees. We are also focused on providing the best possible service to our customers. We take our responsibility as a global corporate citizen very seriously. These values motivate our teams to take significant measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and minimize business disruption in this very challenging environment. I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we will not address any customer or product-specific questions. We appreciate your cooperation. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nJim Suva: Thank you, very much. If I heard correctly, you gave some utilization rates. And I believe \u2013 did you say 80% was as you exited the quarter or as you stand now? And maybe you can update us on kind of where you stand now? Because it's been a couple of weeks since the quarter has ended, and then I'll probably have a follow-up?\nMark Mondello: Hey Jim, maybe stepping back to \u2013 if we go back to Chinese New Year, as people were coming back to our factories in China immediately after that with various quarantine protocols, our factories mid-February, we're running probably between 10% and 20%. As we indexed through mid-February, it moved to 40% to 50%. And I think Mike said in his prepared remarks as we exited the month, we were closer to 80%. As we sit here in mid-March, our China factories are actually near normal, and we have some pockets around the globe where factories are suboptimal. But I would say, from a utilization perspective, suboptimal by only 5% to 10%. Most of that is due to supply chain issues. In some odd way, as we sit today, I think China is the least of our concerns. But again, as we look forward in terms of overall global factory utilization, we're able to accommodate all of the demand that's in front of us as long as we can get parts.\nJim Suva: Perfect. And then that led exactly to my follow-up question was, is now the concern, kind of, focused on hey, it's great efforts that China is recovering is now the kind of the efforts keeping an eye on your other locations outside in case it spreads, and it sounds like you, kind of, alluded to, yes, but any thoughts on, I guess, that would be the next thing that you're watching and working on?\nMark Mondello: Yes, that\u2019s fair. If you think about what Mike said, we had this $50 million hit to core earnings in Q2 that was broken out by \u2013 again, we had onetime quarantine infrastructure costs, idle labor, incremental labor costs, largely around China. The factory inefficiencies in China for \u2013 just kind of big picture, factory inefficiencies in China were largely due to labor shortages. That's mostly behind us now. Factory inefficiencies globally, not so much labor shortages, but supply chain constraints and again, we've got some pockets of inefficiencies, but largely, our footprint is up and running. So what else is really interesting in this, Jim, is in relatively short order, our team garnered significant experience in dealing with COVID-19 at the very front end of this pandemic because of our presence in China. And in terms of our actions and approach, we've shared our experiences openly with customers and competitors. And our playbook is ready and actionable if things get notably worse in North America and Europe.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for your details. And I concur that the actions you're taking to care for your people are first and foremost, most important. Thank you so much.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning. Mark, it sounds like, obviously, the supply and capacity side is incrementally better. So I just wanted to touch on demand. I think in the February release, you had mentioned that there was no change in product orders so I just was hoping for an update on that, with the heart of the question being investor fear would be how to mitigate potential negative leverage, given you've done a good job getting utilization back up. But if we have order cuts coming, how do you think about that for potential deleverage?\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Adam. If I might take the liberty, let me expand my answer and talk about, kind of, both sides of the equation, if I could, Adam. One is on the cost side. So again, Mike and during my response to Jim talked about, kind of, what made up the $50 million. The $50 million in February was not for a full month. So if I were to, kind of, extrapolate the $50 million for February on a monthly run rate if that continues to be about $60 million, $65 million against our core line per month. With all the work our team has done on the cost side, Adam, again, we see China getting better, and we think business interruption costs in China, they have declined and will remain a much lesser extent, relative to what we experienced in February. As we see North America and Europe, we think the potential for North America and Europe is to get a bit worse. You see kind of all the social dislocation taking place and whatnot. So what we've done on the cost side is it's a really foggy, kind of, opaque landscape, if you will, but, kind of, on a weighted average, blended average basis. For the month of March, we're planning on about $10 million to $20 million of business disruption and interruption costs across our footprint. And for April, we think it'll be much the same. Coming back to your specific question, if I think about demand in and of itself, this gets more difficult. But what I can tell you in terms of how we're budgeting and talking about the business internally in terms of costs and actions, we've haircut demand for March. We're going to haircut demand further for April. And then beyond April, it's really dependent on the \u2013 what I would say is the control and containment of the virus and then also the fear is directly related to the virus. So as everyone has seen this week, the macro backdrop, the landscape are changing day by day, and then the associated actions are compounding hourly. So that's, kind of, what's inside our head on how we're thinking about the business for the next 60 to 90 days.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And just to clarify, was that $50 million or so of virus related expenses excluded in the $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS?\nMike Dastoor: No, it\u2019s included in the $0.50, Adam. If we hadn't included it, our EPS would have been $0.75.\nAdam Tindle: Yes. Yes. It would have been a pretty nice quarter. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Mike, can you maybe update us on cash flow given the new forecast? Do you have any feel around that? Do you think still $500-plus million for the year and also capital allocation, given, obviously, we're in a very new share price range? I think you previously were going to do $250 million of buybacks in fiscal 2020 and $350 million in fiscal 2021. Does it make sense to maybe change that weighting?\nMike Dastoor: So I\u2019ll answer the second question first. We're continuing to monitor and be thoughtful about our capital allocation policy. While cash is extremely important, the share price is absurdly cheap right now. So we're trying to balance that, and we'll keep cash in mind, of course. For your first question, I think from a cash standpoint, we're pretty good. I think we had a great bank facility transaction in January. We \u2013 I think we had a $500 million senior note, $3 billion of bank credit facilities, and we've converted a lot of our short-term debt into long-term debt. So the timing is very opportunistic. It was lucky as well that it happened well before the COVID-19 outbreak started. We feel really good about our cash flow. And free cash flow, is it going to be in the $500 million range? Right now, as it stands, yes, probably in the $400 million to $500 million range. It's all about demand, Adam. Right now, while we're not seeing huge cuts from our customers, that could change at any point in time. But I think Mark talked about the social distancing that will have an impact going forward. We just don't know the magnitude and extent of it at this time.\nAdam Tindle: Understandable. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Chung: Hey, guys. It\u2019s Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking our question. So just a follow-up on customer demand and kind of the haircuts you're baking in? Are those more on kind of faster product cycle products? And are these, kind of, being pushed out maybe a couple of months out? Or if you could confirm if any of these products are being canceled?\nMark Mondello: It's too early to tell. I just think \u2013 I think it's really prudent for us to kind of haircut the business a little bit, starting in March, April. So there's no \u2013 there's not been an exact science to it. And even if we tried to take some type of fine scalpel and figure out what sectors, what business, it's impossible. So again, my commentary was really around \u2013 we can say absolutely nothing or we can try to kind of bring in to the heads of the leadership team, and my commentary around demand is things are very murky. We are planning for demand to soften a bit. And again, we're running internal cost and actions accordingly.\nPaul Chung: Got you. And then on kind of new customer discussions, are you seeing more preference for America's production or Europe or with intentions of kind of avoiding potential areas more sensitive to tariffs? Are you seeing any trends there now more customers motivated to do so? And then how does that, kind of, impact your operating margins longer term?\nMark Mondello: We \u2013 I think we talked either the December call or the September call, the first half of this year, we are experiencing, I don't know, $10 million to $15 million in terms of bringing up additional capacity in places like Vietnam, Penang and Mexico. That still holds. What I would tell you is those kind of costs are minimal and very finite in terms of how all this impacts our margins, in terms of moving business around. I don't think it has much of an impact long-term at all because of our global footprint. So whether customers want to be served in China, Southeast Asia, Mexico, North America being U.S. and then Europe, we're in really, really good position based on our footprint. I think today, our footprint is well optimized.\nPaul Chung: Great. And then my last question. So if you could just talk about the pricing environment. We know that Flex is kind of focusing more on the higher-margin business, kind of turning away some of the lower margin one. Is that kind of creating a floor on margins for new business? What would, kind of, be the alternative to Flex besides Jabil for like scale, volume? If you could talk about the dynamics there and how that, kind of, benefits you guys? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: I don\u2019t know. If \u2013 margin is good for the industry. So I think if Flex is doing their thing. And I heard some of their comments earlier this week. If they're focused on raising margins, I think overall, that's good for the industry.\nPaul Chung: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The first question was on the component availability topic. I wasn't sure if you could provide any context relative to some of the past periods of supply chain disruptions, be it tariffs or floods or tsunami? And just what you're seeing today and some similarities with what you're seeing today versus some of those past examples? And on that topic, are there any particular end markets or component types that you're most concerned about?\nMark Mondello: Yes, Mark, I think it's across the board. What I will tell you is supply chain was quite normal, December, January, we started getting some fairly strong signals, especially around China and Asian suppliers that they were having a hard time with labor as people were coming back from Chinese New Year. We started hitting some real soft spots specific to supply chain late February. But what's been amazing to me is between our scale, our relationships and our overall actions and activities with the supply base in, call it, two weeks, our team has been deployed on the phones, and this could have been a very elongated, deep divot, if you will. We see it again, finite in terms of when it'll get completely back to normal, that's TBD. And again, the good news is China is getting back to normal pretty quick in terms of suppliers in Europe and North America, I think we still have to go through that cycle a bit. But as I said in the opening of Q&A, all of our global factories are running near what I'd characterize normal utilization, a few pockets being off 5% to 10%. But our supply chain team is doing a wonderful job.\nMark Delaney: Thanks for the details there, Mark. I also wanted to follow-up on your comment about some of the haircutting of the forecast. Do you think you're getting double orders and so that's why you're haircutting or potential and demand weakness? And so you're more just trying to proactively think about potential demand destruction? So just trying to think through how you guys are managing that? And is there any sort of rough quantification about what percent you're haircutting these forecasts? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Yes. I'll stay away from percentages just because \u2013 I don't even know that they make any sense. We're \u2013 I think about the current conditions, Mark, I think about the virus, the associated fears, the actions and then maybe in terms of demand, I think about it may be appropriately about the possible in actions both by corporations and consumers, say, over the next three, four, five, six months, we just don't know what that's going to be. So again, to take our demand signals, which today are holding reasonably well and just extrapolate that directly with no haircut, I just don't think that makes any sense. And I'll go back to \u2013 just this week alone, if you look at what's happened in the U.S. in terms of professional sports, concerts, group events and whatnot, some way, shape or form, that's going to have to have an impact on small business, et cetera. So again, I think it's the prudent thing to do. And let's just hope that this is finite, and I think it will be temporary. It's just a matter of the definition of finite and temporary, does this last three months or does it last 12 to 18 months. But what I do know is the team we have in place is probably the most experienced in the business. The team's resilient, proven. We've been through this before, 708. Those of us that have been around a long time, around here for the tech rec, and one thing our company knows how to do is manage variable costs and customer care in tough times.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I was wondering if you could share with us your travel policy going forward? And whether it could affect ramping new programs? And then secondly, could you talk about the precautions you're taking to prevent infection inside your plants on a global basis? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nMark Mondello: Sure. Those are great questions. I \u2013 our call today is a bit unique, as Adam said, in terms of structure, form and content, and I'd love to talk about the business, but I think in times like this, in many ways, saying less is saying more. Especially, I don't believe in saying a lot of stuff when we just don't have good clarity. But one is \u2013 your question is a really good lead in. I always talk on our calls about thanking our people. And our number one priority, and Adam and Mike both hit this, is the safety, health and well-being of our folks. And a special thanks to everybody on our team. We had \u2013 even though we clipped $50 million out of our core results, I got to acknowledge \u2013 we had near-perfect execution this past quarter and that was split between taking just incredible care of our people, great care of our customers, all while reacting with \u2013 I don\u2019t know, how we\u2019d say it, speed and purpose to these disruptions, is amazing. And if I think about certain line items, when we talk about speed and purpose, one is, out of no where, when folks were coming back from Chinese New Year, our team in China set up quarantine centers and quarantine space that was really, really first rate. We immediately streamlined testing and protocols, partnering with local hospitals. We went through it, what I would characterize as, extreme sanitization and disinfection in our Asian sites, and we\u2019re now doing that in our U.S. and European sites. Our HR team, combined with our business partners and our technical folks have set up a comprehensive education and awareness for all of our employees. Our travel restrictions have been, I think, a very fine balance between keeping our people safe and conducting business in a very, very thoughtful way. We\u2019ve had policies put in place in terms of reducing visits to our factories. And then again, what I would characterize as Jabil ingenuity, we\u2019ve been producing our own surgical masks for our folks in Asia and throughout the world, if needed. And in an earlier Q&A question, Steve, I made the mention, I think that really positions us well if things don\u2019t get worse in North America and Europe, that\u2019s a fantastic outcome. If things do get worse in North America and Europe, we\u2019ve already written the playbook. And again, it\u2019s ready to go. And I\u2019ll say it again, in some odd way, as we sit here today, China is the least of our concerns. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve been up to.\nSteven Fox: Thanks for that. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Mike, you mentioned the credit line that\u2019s available have you tapped it in the current quarter? And could you just sort of talk about your plans to and whether there\u2019d be any restrictions on accessing that cash if you needed to?\nMike Dastoor: So we\u2019re not aware of any restrictions. We tap in tap out as required. Obviously, we move funds around internationally, globally. We\u2019re in 30 countries. So we do move funds around pretty efficiently. So no issues there at all, Steve.\nSteven Fox: Thank you. Good luck going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Good morning, everyone. As valuations have come in, can you give us your thoughts on maybe growth inorganically? Your thoughts on M&A? And what are some of the things you look for in targets?\nMark Mondello: Hi, Ruplu. I think we start with \u2013 we\u2019re always in the market shopping. That\u2019s headed up by our strategic team led by Courtney. So we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got our toes in the water constantly looking at M&A. Our strong, strong preferences is small \u2013 smaller deals that help us in terms of capability and aligned with our strategy. We felt for the last 18 months that price tags on almost everything we looked at were ridiculous. And therefore, we\u2019ve paired back some of our M&A activity. I would never want prices to come down based on something like COVID-19 because of the impact it has on individuals and families and whatnot, and it really does look like it\u2019s a pandemic. But if \u2013 I think COVID-19 aside, I think what\u2019s happened the last couple of weeks, it just felt to us like the market was overbought to begin with independent of the virus. So if we can see prices get back to normal, I think our activity in the M&A world will pick up. I \u2013 we\u2019re not out shopping for a big $1 billion deals, but there is some things we\u2019d like to do in terms of increasing capabilities. I will tell you that assuming we get to the other side of this virus, stuff still needs to get built. I mentioned earlier, our factory optimization is exceptional. Let\u2019s remember that all our factories are wrapped in a wonderful IT network that\u2019s very unique. And then when I think about both organic and M&A, Ruplu, secular trends in markets like 5G, health care, advanced handsets, electric transport, disruption in retail machine learning and 3D additive blah, blah. Although demand might be softer a bit of time, those secular trends haven\u2019t changed. I think they remain intact, and that will be really good for us.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that. Mark, that makes sense. Maybe on the cost side, can you remind us what are some of the costs that are under your control? And how should we think about SG&A as a percent of sales going forward as you try and control some of these costs? And I guess related to that, you\u2019ve talked about rationalizing your mobility footprint. Can you just update us on the status of that? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Okay. That was a little bit \u2013 let me just think my way through that. So let me start with your SG&A question. I think 100% of the time when most \u2013 all companies, but I\u2019ll speak specifically for us. When you go through a decade of tremendous growth, I think you tend to get a little bit fluffy in terms of cost and overhead. On a relative basis, we still run this company at around 4% SG&A, which is, I think, fabulous. I\u2019d like to see that come down a little bit. So we are always watching costs. When you have a catalyst like this, I think it has us sharpen our pencil. The nice thing is, is well before COVID-19 occurred. Mike and I talked about, I think it was on the September call about some restructuring for this year that was kind of to continue to shape and optimize our factory network. So in some odd way, we\u2019re out in front of that already. We\u2019ll use this opportunity to take a look at OpEx, infrastructure costs a little bit further in terms of headcount. But I feel good about how we\u2019re positioned, and I certainly feel really, really good about our company\u2019s ability to react and act in a very, kind of, agile, swift way. So overall, I feel good about how we sit today.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe just on the mobility rationalization of your footprint, is that more or less done? And any areas of CapEx spend this year and next year that you want to highlight?\nMark Mondello: I don\u2019t really want to get into CapEx at the moment, we\u2019re evaluating that, and Mike addressed some of that in his prepared remarks. In terms of \u2013 instead of mobility footprint, I think the way I would address your question, if I still may, is Mike laid out a pretty good detail on the September call about the restructuring that we have in place that\u2019s going to plan. In fact, we\u2019re a bit ahead of plan, and we\u2019ll continue to see that through.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details and thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is now live.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit about the strength you saw in the beginning of the quarter? I realized a lot has changed since then, but I\u2019m curious about your cloud business. And if you saw some of the continuity of strength from first quarter come through in second? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Shannon. I think as you know, the crazy thing is December and January, I think we put this in the press release. I don\u2019t remember, I know Mike just alluded to it. We got off to a really nice start. And the interesting part of that is, it was really kind of across the board. So our cloud business is operating slightly above plan, our \u2013 the mobility side of our business, the demand is quite strong. And when I say demand is quite strong. I would take the liberty to characterize that as Jabil\u2019s demand. And I think there\u2019s two components of that. I think overall in demand is holding pretty well in that market. But the amazing work our team has done in that area, we continue to pick up some market share, which is also driving our demand. And then when I look at our EMS side of the business, the strength to the start of the quarter was kind of peanut buttered across six or eight different sectors.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And then Mike, I had a question. Your, I think, 1.7x leverage, just curious, I guess, a little bit back to the acquisition, but then any thoughts of maybe levering up a little bit, given where the stock price is at? I know you guys tend to be pretty conservative. But I\u2019m curious if the recent dislocation provides somewhat of an opportunity? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: Yes, we\u2019ll continue to monitor and be thoughtful of that capital allocation policy that I talked about earlier, we do have an allocation methodology laid out, and we will stick to that. And as opportunities come up, we\u2019ll definitely go in and have a look.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Thanks and good morning. Yes, a question regarding your commentary about the inventory and working capital. It sounds like that\u2019s fairly under control in terms of the component issues that you\u2019ve been seeing. But should we expect inventory levels to remain fairly high here relative to the progress you saw in recent quarters just because you and your customers may tend to be more conservative and want to keep some inventory on hand?\nMike Dastoor: Yes. I think as the COVID-19 spreads in other parts of the world and supply chain constraints continue, we will see a little bit of a spike in inventory. February was a bit of a perfect storm as well. We were running at 30%, 40% capacity, that is highly unlikely in the rest of the world at this stage. Now that could change. So there will be a little bit of a spike, but not as much as February.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. And in terms of impact on your free cash flow? And I know you\u2019ve had some pretty \u2013 fairly robust free cash flow targets for the year. I guess, along with the rest of your guidance, that\u2019s sort of off the table at this point?\nMike Dastoor: I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s off the table. We\u2019re still targeting that number. Remember, when demands falls and revenue goes down, our working capital from a dollar standpoint actually improves. So there\u2019s nice little EMS paradox that goes on with our type of business, which gives a little bit of a natural protection.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. And then as you look \u2013 and Mark, you talked about relative strength on the mobility front and everybody has been looking forward to the next-generation cycles and product cycles later this year, any change in terms of things you\u2019re doing with customers in terms of pilot programs and R&D and that sort of thing as you prepare for the end of the year?\nMark Mondello: No, I\u2019d say that business is usual.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thanks very much and thanks for all the details.\nMark Mondello: Thanks Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you for joining us. This now concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Hey Jim, maybe stepping back to \u2013 if we go back to Chinese New Year, as people were coming back to our factories in China immediately after that with various quarantine protocols, our factories mid-February, we're running probably between 10% and 20%. As we indexed through mid-February, it moved to 40% to 50%. And I think Mike said in his prepared remarks as we exited the month, we were closer to 80%. As we sit here in mid-March, our China factories are actually near normal, and we have some pockets around the globe where factories are suboptimal. But I would say, from a utilization perspective, suboptimal by only 5% to 10%. Most of that is due to supply chain issues. In some odd way, as we sit today, I think China is the least of our concerns. But again, as we look forward in terms of overall global factory utilization, we're able to accommodate all of the demand that's in front of us as long as we can get parts. Yes, that's fair. If you think about what Mike said, we had this $50 million hit to core earnings in Q2 that was broken out by \u2013 again, we had onetime quarantine infrastructure costs, idle labor, incremental labor costs, largely around China. The factory inefficiencies in China for \u2013 just kind of big picture, factory inefficiencies in China were largely due to labor shortages. That's mostly behind us now. Factory inefficiencies globally, not so much labor shortages, but supply chain constraints and again, we've got some pockets of inefficiencies, but largely, our footprint is up and running. So what else is really interesting in this, Jim, is in relatively short order, our team garnered significant experience in dealing with COVID-19 at the very front end of this pandemic because of our presence in China. And in terms of our actions and approach, we've shared our experiences openly with customers and competitors. And our playbook is ready and actionable if things get notably worse in North America and Europe. Yes. Thanks, Jim. Yes. Thanks, Adam. If I might take the liberty, let me expand my answer and talk about, kind of, both sides of the equation, if I could, Adam. One is on the cost side. So again, Mike and during my response to Jim talked about, kind of, what made up the $50 million. The $50 million in February was not for a full month. So if I were to, kind of, extrapolate the $50 million for February on a monthly run rate if that continues to be about $60 million, $65 million against our core line per month. With all the work our team has done on the cost side, Adam, again, we see China getting better, and we think business interruption costs in China, they have declined and will remain a much lesser extent, relative to what we experienced in February. As we see North America and Europe, we think the potential for North America and Europe is to get a bit worse. You see kind of all the social dislocation taking place and whatnot. So what we've done on the cost side is it's a really foggy, kind of, opaque landscape, if you will, but, kind of, on a weighted average, blended average basis. For the month of March, we're planning on about $10 million to $20 million of business disruption and interruption costs across our footprint. And for April, we think it'll be much the same. Coming back to your specific question, if I think about demand in and of itself, this gets more difficult. But what I can tell you in terms of how we're budgeting and talking about the business internally in terms of costs and actions, we've haircut demand for March. We're going to haircut demand further for April. And then beyond April, it's really dependent on the \u2013 what I would say is the control and containment of the virus and then also the fear is directly related to the virus. So as everyone has seen this week, the macro backdrop, the landscape are changing day by day, and then the associated actions are compounding hourly. So that's, kind of, what's inside our head on how we're thinking about the business for the next 60 to 90 days. It's too early to tell. I just think \u2013 I think it's really prudent for us to kind of haircut the business a little bit, starting in March, April. So there's no \u2013 there's not been an exact science to it. And even if we tried to take some type of fine scalpel and figure out what sectors, what business, it's impossible. So again, my commentary was really around \u2013 we can say absolutely nothing or we can try to kind of bring in to the heads of the leadership team, and my commentary around demand is things are very murky. We are planning for demand to soften a bit. And again, we're running internal cost and actions accordingly. We \u2013 I think we talked either the December call or the September call, the first half of this year, we are experiencing, I don't know, $10 million to $15 million in terms of bringing up additional capacity in places like Vietnam, Penang and Mexico. That still holds. What I would tell you is those kind of costs are minimal and very finite in terms of how all this impacts our margins, in terms of moving business around. I don't think it has much of an impact long-term at all because of our global footprint. So whether customers want to be served in China, Southeast Asia, Mexico, North America being U.S. and then Europe, we're in really, really good position based on our footprint. I think today, our footprint is well optimized. I don't know. If \u2013 margin is good for the industry. So I think if Flex is doing their thing. And I heard some of their comments earlier this week. If they're focused on raising margins, I think overall, that's good for the industry. Yes, Mark, I think it's across the board. What I will tell you is supply chain was quite normal, December, January, we started getting some fairly strong signals, especially around China and Asian suppliers that they were having a hard time with labor as people were coming back from Chinese New Year. We started hitting some real soft spots specific to supply chain late February. But what's been amazing to me is between our scale, our relationships and our overall actions and activities with the supply base in, call it, two weeks, our team has been deployed on the phones, and this could have been a very elongated, deep divot, if you will. We see it again, finite in terms of when it'll get completely back to normal, that's TBD. And again, the good news is China is getting back to normal pretty quick in terms of suppliers in Europe and North America, I think we still have to go through that cycle a bit. But as I said in the opening of Q&A, all of our global factories are running near what I'd characterize normal utilization, a few pockets being off 5% to 10%. But our supply chain team is doing a wonderful job. Yes. I'll stay away from percentages just because \u2013 I don't even know that they make any sense. We're \u2013 I think about the current conditions, Mark, I think about the virus, the associated fears, the actions and then maybe in terms of demand, I think about it may be appropriately about the possible in actions both by corporations and consumers, say, over the next three, four, five, six months, we just don't know what that's going to be. So again, to take our demand signals, which today are holding reasonably well and just extrapolate that directly with no haircut, I just don't think that makes any sense. And I'll go back to \u2013 just this week alone, if you look at what's happened in the U.S. in terms of professional sports, concerts, group events and whatnot, some way, shape or form, that's going to have to have an impact on small business, et cetera. So again, I think it's the prudent thing to do. And let's just hope that this is finite, and I think it will be temporary. It's just a matter of the definition of finite and temporary, does this last three months or does it last 12 to 18 months. But what I do know is the team we have in place is probably the most experienced in the business. The team's resilient, proven. We've been through this before, 708. Those of us that have been around a long time, around here for the tech rec, and one thing our company knows how to do is manage variable costs and customer care in tough times. Yes. Sure. Those are great questions. I \u2013 our call today is a bit unique, as Adam said, in terms of structure, form and content, and I'd love to talk about the business, but I think in times like this, in many ways, saying less is saying more. Especially, I don't believe in saying a lot of stuff when we just don't have good clarity. But one is \u2013 your question is a really good lead in. I always talk on our calls about thanking our people. And our number one priority, and Adam and Mike both hit this, is the safety, health and well-being of our folks. And a special thanks to everybody on our team. We had \u2013 even though we clipped $50 million out of our core results, I got to acknowledge \u2013 we had near-perfect execution this past quarter and that was split between taking just incredible care of our people, great care of our customers, all while reacting with \u2013 I don't know, how we'd say it, speed and purpose to these disruptions, is amazing. And if I think about certain line items, when we talk about speed and purpose, one is, out of no where, when folks were coming back from Chinese New Year, our team in China set up quarantine centers and quarantine space that was really, really first rate. We immediately streamlined testing and protocols, partnering with local hospitals. We went through it, what I would characterize as, extreme sanitization and disinfection in our Asian sites, and we're now doing that in our U.S. and European sites. Our HR team, combined with our business partners and our technical folks have set up a comprehensive education and awareness for all of our employees. Our travel restrictions have been, I think, a very fine balance between keeping our people safe and conducting business in a very, very thoughtful way. We've had policies put in place in terms of reducing visits to our factories. And then again, what I would characterize as Jabil ingenuity, we've been producing our own surgical masks for our folks in Asia and throughout the world, if needed. And in an earlier Q&A question, Steve, I made the mention, I think that really positions us well if things don't get worse in North America and Europe, that's a fantastic outcome. If things do get worse in North America and Europe, we've already written the playbook. And again, it's ready to go. And I'll say it again, in some odd way, as we sit here today, China is the least of our concerns. So that's kind of what we've been up to. Hi, Ruplu. I think we start with \u2013 we're always in the market shopping. That's headed up by our strategic team led by Courtney. So we're \u2013 we've got our toes in the water constantly looking at M&A. Our strong, strong preferences is small \u2013 smaller deals that help us in terms of capability and aligned with our strategy. We felt for the last 18 months that price tags on almost everything we looked at were ridiculous. And therefore, we've paired back some of our M&A activity. I would never want prices to come down based on something like COVID-19 because of the impact it has on individuals and families and whatnot, and it really does look like it's a pandemic. But if \u2013 I think COVID-19 aside, I think what's happened the last couple of weeks, it just felt to us like the market was overbought to begin with independent of the virus. So if we can see prices get back to normal, I think our activity in the M&A world will pick up. I \u2013 we're not out shopping for a big $1 billion deals, but there is some things we'd like to do in terms of increasing capabilities. I will tell you that assuming we get to the other side of this virus, stuff still needs to get built. I mentioned earlier, our factory optimization is exceptional. Let's remember that all our factories are wrapped in a wonderful IT network that's very unique. And then when I think about both organic and M&A, Ruplu, secular trends in markets like 5G, health care, advanced handsets, electric transport, disruption in retail machine learning and 3D additive blah, blah. Although demand might be softer a bit of time, those secular trends haven't changed. I think they remain intact, and that will be really good for us. Okay. That was a little bit \u2013 let me just think my way through that. So let me start with your SG&A question. I think 100% of the time when most \u2013 all companies, but I'll speak specifically for us. When you go through a decade of tremendous growth, I think you tend to get a little bit fluffy in terms of cost and overhead. On a relative basis, we still run this company at around 4% SG&A, which is, I think, fabulous. I'd like to see that come down a little bit. So we are always watching costs. When you have a catalyst like this, I think it has us sharpen our pencil. The nice thing is, is well before COVID-19 occurred. Mike and I talked about, I think it was on the September call about some restructuring for this year that was kind of to continue to shape and optimize our factory network. So in some odd way, we're out in front of that already. We'll use this opportunity to take a look at OpEx, infrastructure costs a little bit further in terms of headcount. But I feel good about how we're positioned, and I certainly feel really, really good about our company's ability to react and act in a very, kind of, agile, swift way. So overall, I feel good about how we sit today. I don't really want to get into CapEx at the moment, we're evaluating that, and Mike addressed some of that in his prepared remarks. In terms of \u2013 instead of mobility footprint, I think the way I would address your question, if I still may, is Mike laid out a pretty good detail on the September call about the restructuring that we have in place that's going to plan. In fact, we're a bit ahead of plan, and we'll continue to see that through. Thanks, Ruplu. Yes. Thanks, Shannon. I think as you know, the crazy thing is December and January, I think we put this in the press release. I don't remember, I know Mike just alluded to it. We got off to a really nice start. And the interesting part of that is, it was really kind of across the board. So our cloud business is operating slightly above plan, our \u2013 the mobility side of our business, the demand is quite strong. And when I say demand is quite strong. I would take the liberty to characterize that as Jabil's demand. And I think there's two components of that. I think overall in demand is holding pretty well in that market. But the amazing work our team has done in that area, we continue to pick up some market share, which is also driving our demand. And then when I look at our EMS side of the business, the strength to the start of the quarter was kind of peanut buttered across six or eight different sectors. No, I'd say that business is usual. Thanks Matt."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As Adam stated, our Q2 results were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Before I cover our Q2 results, I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the dynamics that unfolded during the quarter. We began Q2 with a stronger-than-anticipated start to the fiscal quarter. As we moved into February, demand held, but our ability to meet demand was greatly diminished as virus containment efforts ramped in China. during the quarter, we incurred approximately $53 million in direct costs associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. I'd now like to provide you with the makeup of these costs. First, we incurred additional labor costs in Q2. During February, we strategically made the decision to compensate our employees who are restricted and quarantined. These factors contributed to higher labor costs than we expected going into the quarter. Second, our factory utilization in China was negatively impacted in February due to travel disruptions and restrictions. To add further context to the higher labor costs and lower utilization, February began with the Chinese New Year holiday being extended by 10 to 14 days depending on location. Most of our larger sites in China began to come back online later than anticipated. And by February 14, we were only operating at 45% to 50% capacity. We exited the quarter at approximately 80% utilization in China. Third, during the quarter, we also incurred lost revenue associated with both upstream and downstream supply chain disruptions, which impacted our worldwide footprint. And finally, in an effort to keep our employee base safe and healthy, we incurred unanticipated costs to procure necessary supplies to keep our people safe, items, such as face masks, hand sanitizers, thermometers and personal protection equipment. I would like to highlight that February was an anomaly. Under normal circumstances, if demand diminished, our variable costs would have been materially lower as we would have adjusted our costs to the demand environment. Turning now to our Q2 financial results. Net revenue for the second quarter was $6.1 billion. GAAP operating income was $91 million, and our GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.02. Core operating income during the quarter was $159 million. Net interest expense during the quarter was $52 million. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 26.6%, in-line with expectations. Core diluted earnings per share were $0.50. It's worth noting that the additional costs associated with the outbreak negatively impacted our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.25. Now moving to our GAAP results. As expected, we incurred $30 million in restructuring and severance-related charges in Q2, predominantly associated with the 2020 restructuring plan we announced in September of last year. This plan continues to remain on track and as a reminder, is expected to result in an incremental cost savings benefit of $25 million, mainly in the second half of FY20. Also during the quarter, we incurred a onetime non-cash impairment charge of approximately $12 million in connection with the sale of an investment in the optical networking segment. Now turning to our second quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $2.3 billion. From an end-market perspective, we experienced good demand in the health care and mobility end markets. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.8 billion. From an end-market perspective, we saw additional strength in the semi cap space, while demand in the balance of the business came in largely as expected. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. During Q2, our total days of inventory came in at 70 days, an increase of 13 days sequentially, driven mainly by idle capacity and supply chain constraints due to COVID-19. Higher inventory levels during the quarter were offset slightly by lower days of sales outstanding at the end of the quarter, driven mainly by lower February sales. Cash flows provided by operations were $63 million in Q2, and net capital expenditures totaled $205 million. We exited the quarter with a total debt to core EBITDA level of approximately 1.7x and cash balances of $697 million. Jabil has over $3 billion of global revolver credit facilities, and at the end of Q2, over 90% of these facilities were available. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for $72 million as part of our two year, $600 million authorization we announced in September. In closing, as always, Jabil's No.1 priority is the health and well-being of our employees. We are also focused on providing the best possible service to our customers. We take our responsibility as a global corporate citizen very seriously. These values motivate our teams to take significant measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and minimize business disruption in this very challenging environment. I'll now turn the call over to Adam. No, it's included in the $0.50, Adam. If we hadn't included it, our EPS would have been $0.75. So I'll answer the second question first. We're continuing to monitor and be thoughtful about our capital allocation policy. While cash is extremely important, the share price is absurdly cheap right now. So we're trying to balance that, and we'll keep cash in mind, of course. For your first question, I think from a cash standpoint, we're pretty good. I think we had a great bank facility transaction in January. We \u2013 I think we had a $500 million senior note, $3 billion of bank credit facilities, and we've converted a lot of our short-term debt into long-term debt. So the timing is very opportunistic. It was lucky as well that it happened well before the COVID-19 outbreak started. We feel really good about our cash flow. And free cash flow, is it going to be in the $500 million range? Right now, as it stands, yes, probably in the $400 million to $500 million range. It's all about demand, Adam. Right now, while we're not seeing huge cuts from our customers, that could change at any point in time. But I think Mark talked about the social distancing that will have an impact going forward. We just don't know the magnitude and extent of it at this time. So we're not aware of any restrictions. We tap in tap out as required. Obviously, we move funds around internationally, globally. We're in 30 countries. So we do move funds around pretty efficiently. So no issues there at all, Steve. Yes, we'll continue to monitor and be thoughtful of that capital allocation policy that I talked about earlier, we do have an allocation methodology laid out, and we will stick to that. And as opportunities come up, we'll definitely go in and have a look. Yes. I think as the COVID-19 spreads in other parts of the world and supply chain constraints continue, we will see a little bit of a spike in inventory. February was a bit of a perfect storm as well. We were running at 30%, 40% capacity, that is highly unlikely in the rest of the world at this stage. Now that could change. So there will be a little bit of a spike, but not as much as February. I wouldn't say it's off the table. We're still targeting that number. Remember, when demands falls and revenue goes down, our working capital from a dollar standpoint actually improves. So there's nice little EMS paradox that goes on with our type of business, which gives a little bit of a natural protection."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's First Quarter of Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor.  Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the discussion and view the slides, you will need to be logged in to our webcast on jabil.com. At the end of today's call, both the presentation and a replay of the call will be available on Jabil's Investor Relations website.  During today's conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including, among other things, those regarding our outlook for business and expected second quarter and fiscal '20 net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  With that, it's now my pleasure to hand the call over to Mark Mondello.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by thanking our folks here at Jabil for their continued hard work and commitment. I'd also like to extend my sincere gratitude to each and every Jabil employee for making safety their personal priority. And before getting into our results and the business at hand, I want to wish all of you a safe and peaceful holiday season.  Now please turn to Slide 4 where we'll look at our first quarter results. Our team generated core operating income of $277 million on revenues of $7.5 billion, resulting in core earnings per share of $1.05 and a core operating margin of 3.7%. During the quarter, we delivered to our plan of record with one exception, this exception being our newly formed geocentric cloud services business, which came in well above our forecasted revenue. This revenue upside was helpful for the quarter, but for me, what's most valuable is how our cloud solution is being accepted and adopted in the marketplace. Overall, Q1 gave us a favorable start to the year. As is customary, Mike will provide more detail around our Q1 results and speak to our forward guidance during his prepared remarks.  With the first quarter behind us, the team is dialed in. We're obsessed with providing first rate solutions to our customers while also delivering for our shareholders. We understand that financial results matter and matter a lot, but how we go about producing these results is paramount to me. Said differently, I think often about our purpose and our conduct. And when I think about our purpose and conduct, I think about keeping our people safe and ensuring a fully inclusive work environment. I think about unmatched customer care and giving back to the communities around the globe. As CEO, I'm just so appreciative that our team is squarely hitting the mark in all of these areas, and if our conduct and behavior stands through the year, as I expect it will, we'll have a banner FY '20, a year that will make us all very proud.  Moving on to Slide 6, you'll see a terrific picture, a picture which shows the composition of our commercial portfolio. This picture underscores the effort and effectiveness of our team. Over the past few years, I've repeatedly addressed the deliberate increase to our diversification and the positive impact it has on our business. Diversification is key to our performance. Furthermore, the makeup of our commercial portfolio is special, in fact, intentional and unique when considering the full enterprise.  A bit of our foundational magic which makes the portfolio so powerful comes from our ability to efficiently and quickly share technologies across our various business sectors and do so with little friction. With each passing year, our revenue has become far less dependent on any single product or product family, improving the predictability of our earnings while enhancing our ability to execute. Our performance suggests that our diversification strategy continues to excel and gives us tremendous confidence as we move to the back half of FY '20.  And that brings us to our update for the year. Please turn to Slide 7. Our company is well positioned. As we highlighted in September, we're intensely focused on 3 financial metrics: Margins, earnings and cash flows. We anticipate revenues will be up roughly $1.4 billion year-on-year when compared to fiscal '19. More importantly, we see the income coming through side by side with the increase to revenue. Therefore, core operating income will now be in the neighborhood of $980 million for the year, confirming our core margin target of 3.7%. This improved income outlook for the year translates to $3.60 a share in core earnings, up $0.15 from the outlook we offered in September. Lastly, we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $500 million for the year.  In closing, I smile when considering our total body of work. Progress has been explicit and steady. Strategy has been consistent and disciplined and our path forward is clear. We're ushered ahead by our structure, our team and our culture where the whole is far greater than the simple sum of the parts. I truly believe Jabil is making the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer each and every day, and we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to many of the best brands on the planet.  I want to once again offer a special thanks to our team and acknowledge their near-perfect execution during this past quarter. I feel strongly that our execution will continue as the team is carrying good organizational momentum into the back half of the year.  With that, I'd like to wish everyone on the call a safe and peaceful holiday. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Dastoor: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was an excellent quarter in many ways. We saw good diversification and strong performances by both segments. Net revenue for the first quarter was $7.5 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $153 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.26. Core operating income during the quarter was $277 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 3.7%. Net interest and other expense during the quarter was better than expected. Our lower net interest expense during the quarter was driven by less intra-quarter borrowing due to better-than-expected inventory levels during the quarter. Our core tax rate for the quarter was 27%, in line with expectations.  Core diluted earnings per share was $1.05, a 17% improvement over the prior year quarter and approximately $0.12 ahead of previous expectations based on 3 factors. First, we saw excellent operational execution across both segments as we successfully ramped seasonal products in DMS and focused on operational efficiencies associated with last year's new product awards in EMS.  Second, as Mark highlighted, our cloud offering continues to resonate with hyperscale players. It's worth reminding everyone, our cloud business is a bit unique and has been deliberately structured as a geocentric asset-light service offering. Our solution is highly flexible and appropriately agile. With this in mind, during the quarter, we experienced an increase in both demand and content configuration that we were able to swiftly capitalize on given the flexible nature of the model. This compounding effect of increased volumes, coupled with higher materials content, led to approximately $350 million in additional revenue.  And finally, as I just mentioned, our interest and other expense came in better than expected.  Now moving to our GAAP results. As expected, we incurred $45 million in restructuring charges in Q1, largely related to the 2020 restructuring plan we announced in September. This plan continues to remain on track and, as a reminder, is expected to result in an incremental cost savings benefit of $25 million mainly in the second half of FY '20. Also during the quarter, we incurred a noncore charge of approximately $15 million associated with certain distressed customers in the renewable energy space.  Now turning to our first quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.1 billion, an increase of 3% on a year-over-year basis. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 5.6%. Our DMS segment performed very well, driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including health care and edge devices. This is yet another proof point that our diversification strategy is working.  Revenue for our EMS segment increased by 26% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. From an end market perspective, cloud, industrial and automotive came in higher than expected, offset slightly by slower 5G rollouts. Core margins for the segment came in at 2.4%, as expected.  Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. As I referenced earlier, during Q1, our total days of inventory were better than expected, coming in at 57 days, a decline of one day sequentially, reflecting strong execution by our teams and the asset-light nature of our cloud business. This was in spite of closing the third and largest wave of our strategic health care collaboration during the quarter. Improved inventory levels during the quarter were offset by higher days of sales outstandings at the end of the quarter, driven mainly by the timing of sales.  Cash flows provided by operations were $21 million in Q1 and net capital expenditures totaled $207 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.5x and cash balances of $720 million. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $96 million as part of our 2-year $600 million authorization we announced in September. Before turning to Q2 guidance, I'd like to review a new accounting standard we adopted in September. During Q1, we adopted the new lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02. Under the provisions of this standard, companies are now required to record most leases on their balance sheet. You will see the effects of this adoption as we've recorded a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease obligation for the payments required under our lease arrangements. We adopted the standard on the modified retrospective approach. This adoption has no material effect on our statement of operations or statement of cash flows.  Turning now to our second quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 4% on a year-over-year basis to $2.35 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 5% on a year-over-year basis to $4 billion. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.7 billion for an increase of 5% at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $155 million to $255 million with core operating margin in the range of 2.6% to 3.8%. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.82. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.40.  Next, I'd like to outline our updated expectations for revenue in fiscal year '20 by end market. Within DMS, today's outlook suggests higher health care and packaging revenue driven by better-than-expected volumes associated with our strategic health care collaboration. The transition is going extremely well and sets us up for strong results in FY '21 and beyond. We continue to expect margins for DMS to be 4.1% on the year on revenue of approximately $10.2 billion.  Turning to EMS. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect revenue to be higher for cloud, auto and semi cap and Industrial & Energy. We continue to expect margins for EMS to be 3.5% on the year on revenue of approximately $16.5 billion.  In summary, I am pleased with the strong start to the year. For the most part, the year is unfolding as planned, and it's worth noting that our high-level assumptions remain unchanged from 90 days ago, as does our focus.  For the year, we now anticipate revenues will be up roughly $700 million from prior guidance and core operating income has increased to $980 million. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of $3.60 for the year. We also remain committed to delivering free cash flows in excess of $500 million for the year and expanding our core operating margin to 3.7%. Importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term creation to shareholders. As we move into our second quarter, we continue to build on the positive momentum underway in our business and expect future growth in both earnings and free cash flow to come through meaningful margin expansion and improved working capital efficiency.  I'll now turn the call over to Adam to begin Q&A.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we will not address any customer or product-specific questions. We appreciate your cooperation.  Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Adam Tindle from Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: Congrats on a strong start to the fiscal year. Mark, I just wanted to start coming into this fiscal year, I think the story for Jabil was more about margin expansion on kind of more muted revenue growth, but now it looks like you'll grow revenue at the upper end of mid-single digits for the year, which is quite healthy. I'll start by acknowledging that the updated expectations for the year implies just under a 5% operating margin on that incremental revenue. So it looks like good, accretive business that you're taking on, but it's different than what we're seeing from competitors who are culling their business, not taking on more. So maybe just update us on the willingness to take on more growth at this point.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Adam. Nothing has changed since 90 days ago. I think we've got customers to serve. First and foremost, we're going to do everything we can to continue to deliver for shareholders. But we've got really good solutions and services. I think Mike said in his prepared remarks, our DMS revenue came in squarely in line. EMS was up, I don't know, give or take $500 million. $350 million of that was from our cloud services business and about $150 million was kind of scattered across EMS. If I think about the scale of our EMS business, that $150 million is about a 3% uptick, which I think squarely in the air rate of trying to figure out revenue top line with the business so large. And then on the cloud business, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's not just about the uptick for the quarter but how the services are being received in the marketplace.  I think what I'm pleased about is, is unlike some quarters in '19, the income came through and came through nicely with the additional uptick in revenue. So if I just take that $350 million out, and not to make light of the $350 million, I think things are squarely where we thought they would be 90 days ago. And again, what we're driving for, and I think is a good portion of your context is, is consistency. I really like the consistency of the quarter relative to September, beginning year outlook.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, Mike, I know it's still early and I think we've got a good view of the full year, but just wanted to dig into some of the nuances as we shape the back half of this fiscal year. With that $25 million in restructuring, does that have more weight to 3Q or 4Q? And does it enable DMS operating margin to stay north of 3% in each quarter in the back half of the year? I think that's kind of what the implied model would suggest. So really just any help on understanding expectations for 3Q versus 4Q.\nMichael Dastoor: Yes. So the $25 million, Adam, does come in, in the second half of the year. The savings do come in then. You'll be close to the 3% in Q3, Q4. I think Q3 would be higher than 3% and Q4 will be just around that 3% level.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Steven Fox from Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: A couple of questions from me. First on the revenue upside, specifically with the cloud services and also ramping J&J quicker. What was the margin impact from that upside? Especially given there was -- you've mentioned high material content with the cloud services upside.\nMark Mondello: Steve, let me take a swing. So I would characterize it a couple ways. Let me maybe take it up a level and talk about the enterprise. So I think our center point guide for the quarter was $260 million. We delivered $277 million, uptick of about $17 million. We got about $5 million to $6 million of leverage in DMS on revenue that was really spot on to where our guide was. That's a great tribute to our DMS team.  On the $350 million uptick from cloud as well as the other $150 million across the EMS enterprise, so call it the $500 million, we also got what I would characterize as acceptable leverage. The net-net effect of the EMS leverage though, Steve, we saw some deleverage in 5G. And again, we're still bullish on the 5G rollout. There were some areas during Q1 where we saw a little bit of deleverage, but you shake all that up, and again, I'm really pleased with the income that came through on a net basis with the additional upsides of the EMS revenue.\nSteven Fox: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on the Johnson & Johnson business again. So since it's ramping a little bit better than you originally planned 90 days ago, I was wondering if you could sort of put a little more color around about how that happened. Obviously, it sounds just like general execution was good. And what is the implications in terms of the relationship with J&J and as you look out maybe longer term, 12 to 18 months, given what you've done so far?\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks again. Yes, I. Don't want to get into too much details around it. But again, kind of overall, speaking firstly with our health care business, our health care business and that whole team continues to just do a really, really nice job with services and solutions into the marketplace. With the collaboration with JJMD specifically, I think what we said multiple times last year was that revenue for this year would be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. And I think what Mike might have alluded to is I would think that revenue for fiscal year '20 would be on the upper end of that and maybe slightly higher than $1 billion. So in terms of that business, it's going well and we're working really, really hard to serve JJMD.\nMichael Dastoor: And Steve, I think on the September call, we highlighted that the strategic collaboration has a bit of a dilutive effect for us. In FY '20, DMS margins will be about 20 to 30 basis points higher if it wasn't for the strategic collaboration ramp.\nSteven Fox: And that's still going to be the case.\nMark Mondello: That's true. Yes. I think that's a good point, is in FY '19, I think DMS margins were around 4%. In September, we said there would be about a 10 basis point uptick on DMS margins for FY '20 for the year. So pleased with how things are going, health care overall, JJMD. But again, JJMD is still in what I'd consider kind of a semi transition ramp mode through FY '20 moving into '21. And if you kind of exclude that, DMS margins for the year would be closer to 4.3%., so as Mike said, up 30 basis points year-on-year.\nMichael Dastoor: And that's already baked into our guidance.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup.\nJim Suva: And I will ask both my questions at the same time so you can pick any order. You had mentioned significant upside on cloud. This is kind of a newer initiative that many of us who's been following Jabil for many years aren't used to really hearing. Can you extrapolate a little bit about that solution, the offering? And importantly, the visibility of long term versus there are some cloud providers who can have a great quarter or two and then it completely ceased as far as production and product placing. And is this more like the public cloud companies were used to doing or more private clouds? Just help us understand the cloud initiative a little bit better.  Then my second question is you mentioned automotive upside, yet global SAAR has not been overly robust. So I take it that would assume that maybe you won some more auto production or auto content production. And if auto gets stronger, it seems like that this -- the auto side could even see more upside. If you could comment on those two end markets.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim. Okay. That was a lot. So let me try to break that into a couple of pieces. The thing I think we've done a reasonably good job of is we've been very, very consistent in talking about the cloud business. If I think back to fiscal '19, there was a couple of our earnings calls where we actually had a specific slide around the cloud solution as we understood that it can be a little bit confusing. Our -- I would characterize the solution that we're providing as a geocentric asset-light services business. I don't expect the cloud business to go away. I think it's being very well received in the marketplace. And I think we're solving a few different tangential problems with the services and solutions that we're providing, Jim.  The other part of it is the cloud solution that we have is very much a fulfillment model, and so some of it has to do with reducing overall working capital, agility, flexibility in unit configuration. So we've intentionally set that model up, unlike a business that might be a pure white box design, a business that might be more aligned with some of the standard EMS businesses that are more asset-intensive. We've been very thoughtful and the team has been very thoughtful in setting up our cloud business in a very, very asset-light manner.  And so again, the cost and the overall infrastructure can ebb and flow quite nicely with fluctuations in demand. So I don't have a lot of anxiety around some of the demand fluctuations. I think the nice thing is we do anticipate, if there is upside to the business a bit like there was in Q1, I do think that there will be some level of income that will come along with that fluctuation.  In terms of the automotive, one of the things, I think, that our team has done a nice job of is we've been very, very selective in which part of the automotive sector end markets we're choosing to play in. A significant portion of our automotive business is not reliant on what I would call overall automotive sales. So if I think about combustion engines and legacy type of automobiles, our automotive business is more predicated on electrification, the electronic nature of the vehicles and an overall increase in electronic content as well as sensing and sensors. So when I'm thinking about our business, I think a better proxy than overall automotive sales would be what's going on around electrification of vehicles and then overall electrical content. So I hope those answer your questions.\nMichael Dastoor: And Jim, if I could just add. We did post some videos in September at our investor briefing. I think if you want a little bit more color on cloud, the E&I video is a good one to watch.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: First question for Mike. How should we think about free cash flow for the year? I think your original target was over $500 million. Is that still the case? And then during the year, how should we think about the cadence of buybacks at this stage?\nMichael Dastoor: Yes. We continue to be committed to that $500 million plus, I think, is the phrase we used. We're still all confident about that number. So I'd just take that as a $500 million plus. As far as buybacks are concerned, we did $96 million in Q1. I think in September, we talked about a $600 million authorization. $250 million of that was going to be in FY '20, $350 million in '21. That still stands. So we'll probably do the balance of the $250 million over the next three quarters in FY '20.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe one for Mark. You've raised the guidance, the EPS guidance for this year by $0.15. That's great. I mean, looking into fiscal '21, any thoughts on the $4 in EPS? I mean, should we think that there's upside to that as well?\nMark Mondello: Let's go slow, Ruplu. We got a lot of work ahead to deliver this year. I think for now, I would stay firm with the $4 and the 4% margin. And again, the $4 is important. For me, the 4% margin is what we're all focused on. So whether next year in terms of EPS is $3.90, $3.95, $4, $4.05, $4.10, we're really dialed in on the 4% margin. But for now let's keep it at the $4 and 4%. And if things change at all, we'll talk about that more in the March call and the June call.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes. Just a first question just regarding your outlook for the year, Mark. You -- in addition to cloud, you called out actually several segments where you're seeing some upside, including energy and semi cap. Could you give us more color there? And then on the flip side, where you're seeing weakness? You also talked about 5G. And then we know that the networking OEMs have also been relatively weak. So any color there would be appreciated.\nMark Mondello: Matt, just to clarify. Are you asking around Q1 or for the year?\nMatthew Sheerin: For the year, yes. Well, and near term too, yes, both.\nMark Mondello: Yes. So for the year, if you kind of reference back to the green, blue chart that Mike showed, I think we're showing overall mobility roughly flat. We're seeing a nice uptick in health care and packaging, of which a portion of that will be the JJMD collaboration, edge device and lifestyle products. If we look at where we were in September, no change, but year-on-year, that's coming down a bit as we kind of reshape that portfolio. You could think about -- and that kind of covers DMS, Matt. And I think, I think about that as, as we reshape edge device and lifestyle, year-on-year, that coming down $400 million or $500 million, whatever the number is, it's being replaced by some health care and packaging business, which we're pretty excited about.  If I think about kind of puts and takes for EMS for the year, we've taken automotive and semi cap up year-on-year. So last year, I think our automotive, semi cap was in the $2 billion range, maybe just short of that. And we've taken that up to about $2.5 billion for the year. Again, in Suva's question, I talked about kind of the catalyst for automotive, and then we're still staying pat on a semi cap recovery this summer, which has been very consistent with what we said in the September time frame.  And then the other areas are a little bit of an uptick in Industrial & Energy. 5G cloud, again, starting off the year, we saw some lumpiness and some softness in the 5G area. We imagine that will come back. We're still very bullish long term on 5G, but again, I think it'll be with a little bit of choppiness. And then Mike talked in his prepared remarks about the uptick for the quarter in the cloud business. And again, we're early days in that, but it's being well received in the marketplace. And then lastly, we're seeing some weakness on the legacy enterprise customers.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then sort of a bigger-picture question. As Adam pointed out in his question earlier, we are seeing some of your competitors walk away from deals, particularly in the datacom server, storage and networking space. Are those opportunities for you as we're seeing share shifts? Or are you continuing to be disciplined just like your competitors? In the long term, are we seeing some of the leverage shift perhaps from the customers to the EMS suppliers?\nMark Mondello: I don't want to debate where leverage lies. I think we're heavily, heavy -- heavily reliant on our customers, and I hope we provide great service for them. In terms of -- I don't know why some of our competitors are walking away from business. If it's bad business, I think it's good for our industry if people walk away from things like that. For us, I think we're kind of keeping our head down, sticking to our knitting, if you will, rolling out solutions and services that seem to be well received.  I think I would close my answer to your question with we are not chasing revenue and we are, again, really focused on margin and cash flow. We talked about that through '19. We talked about that in September. So I just want to be clear, if we have customers that are walking away from business that's not good business, you can be 100% sure we're not going to put that sand in our bucket. And again, we're kind of keeping our head down and being sure that we're doing the best job we can to grow, but grow in an area that continues to support our goal of driving 4% margins in '21.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Andrew Vadheim from Wolfe Research.\nAndrew Vadheim: Just wanted to ask about the returns you're seeing from the $250 million in growth CapEx earmarked for F '20. And then in terms of the breakdown by end market, should we still be thinking about a similar breakdown as laid out in the Q4 call with around 50% coming from health care?\nMichael Dastoor: No major changes to the CapEx outlook that we outlined in September. Yes, and half will continue to come from the health care side.\nAndrew Vadheim: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the share repurchase question. If we kind of extrapolate the $100 million out, that might imply that you might be keeping a lid on M&A and/or debt repayment. How should we be thinking about sort of those latter two categories going forward?\nMichael Dastoor: It's exactly as we stated in September, and we talked about a $600 million authorization. We said we'll do $250 million in FY '20 and $350 million in FY '21. No change at all to that. I think we'll just continue with that $250 million in FY '20\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. Let's turn the floor back over to Adam for any further or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you for joining us. This now concludes our call. Happy holidays.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Michael Dastoor",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was an excellent quarter in many ways. We saw good diversification and strong performances by both segments. Net revenue for the first quarter was $7.5 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year. GAAP operating income was $153 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.26.

From an end market perspective, cloud, industrial and automotive came in higher than expected, offset slightly by slower 5G rollouts. Core margins for the segment came in at 2.4%, as expected.  Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. As I referenced earlier, during Q1, our total days of inventory were better than expected, coming in at 57 days, a decline of one day sequentially, reflecting strong execution by our teams and the asset-light nature of our cloud business. This was in spite of closing the third and largest wave of our strategic health care collaboration during the quarter. Improved inventory levels during the quarter were offset by higher days of sales outstandings at the end of the quarter, driven mainly by the timing of sales.  Cash flows provided by operations were $21 million in Q1 and net capital expenditures totaled $207 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.5x and cash balances of $720 million. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $96 million as part of our 2-year $600 million authorization we announced in September. Before turning to Q2 guidance, I'd like to review a new accounting standard we adopted in September. During Q1, we adopted the new lease accounting standard, ASU 2016-02. Under the provisions of this standard, companies are now required to record most leases on their balance sheet. You will see the effects of this adoption as we've recorded a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease obligation for the payments required under our lease arrangements. We adopted the standard on the modified retrospective approach. This adoption has no material effect on our statement of operations or statement of cash flows.  Turning now to our second quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 4% on a year-over-year basis to $2.35 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 5% on a year-over-year basis to $4 billion. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.7 billion for an increase of 5% at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $155 million to $255 million with core operating margin in the range of 2.6% to 3.8%. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.82. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.40.  Next, I'd like to outline our updated expectations for revenue in fiscal year '20 by end market. Within DMS, today's outlook suggests higher health care and packaging revenue driven by better-than-expected volumes associated with our strategic health care collaboration. The transition is going extremely well and sets us up for strong results in FY '21 and beyond. We continue to expect margins for DMS to be 4.1% on the year on revenue of approximately $10.2 billion.  Turning to EMS. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect revenue to be higher for cloud, auto and semi cap and Industrial & Energy. We continue to expect margins for EMS to be 3.5% on the year on revenue of approximately $16.5 billion.  In summary, I am pleased with the strong start to the year. For the most part, the year is unfolding as planned, and it's worth noting that our high-level assumptions remain unchanged from 90 days ago, as does our focus.  For the year, we now anticipate revenues will be up roughly $700 million from prior guidance and core operating income has increased to $980 million. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of $3.60 for the year. We also remain committed to delivering free cash flows in excess of $500 million for the year and expanding our core operating margin to 3.7%. Importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term creation to shareholders. As we move into our second quarter, we continue to build on the positive momentum underway in our business and expect future growth in both earnings and free cash flow to come through meaningful margin expansion and improved working capital efficiency.  I'll now turn the call over to Adam to begin Q&A. Yes. So the $25 million, Adam, does come in, in the second half of the year. The savings do come in then. You'll be close to the 3% in Q3, Q4. I think Q3 would be higher than 3% and Q4 will be just around that 3% level. And Steve, I think on the September call, we highlighted that the strategic collaboration has a bit of a dilutive effect for us. In FY '20, DMS margins will be about 20 to 30 basis points higher if it wasn't for the strategic collaboration ramp. And that's already baked into our guidance. And Jim, if I could just add. We did post some videos in September at our investor briefing. I think if you want a little bit more color on cloud, the E&I video is a good one to watch. Yes. We continue to be committed to that $500 million plus, I think, is the phrase we used. We're still all confident about that number. So I'd just take that as a $500 million plus. As far as buybacks are concerned, we did $96 million in Q1. I think in September, we talked about a $600 million authorization. $250 million of that was going to be in FY '20, $350 million in '21. That still stands. So we'll probably do the balance of the $250 million over the next three quarters in FY '20. No major changes to the CapEx outlook that we outlined in September. Yes, and half will continue to come from the health care side. It's exactly as we stated in September, and we talked about a $600 million authorization. We said we'll do $250 million in FY '20 and $350 million in FY '21. No change at all to that. I think we'll just continue with that $250 million in FY '20"

            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by thanking our folks here at Jabil for their continued hard work and commitment. I'd also like to extend my sincere gratitude to each and every Jabil employee for making safety their personal priority. And before getting into our results and the business at hand, I want to wish all of you a safe and peaceful holiday season.  Now please turn to Slide 4 where we'll look at our first quarter results. Our team generated core operating income of $277 million on revenues of $7.5 billion, resulting in core earnings per share of $1.05 and a core operating margin of 3.7%. During the quarter, we delivered to our plan of record with one exception, this exception being our newly formed geocentric cloud services business, which came in well above our forecasted revenue. This revenue upside was helpful for the quarter, but for me, what's most valuable is how our cloud solution is being accepted and adopted in the marketplace. Overall, Q1 gave us a favorable start to the year. As is customary, Mike will provide more detail around our Q1 results and speak to our forward guidance during his prepared remarks.  With the first quarter behind us, the team is dialed in. We're obsessed with providing first rate solutions to our customers while also delivering for our shareholders. We understand that financial results matter and matter a lot, but how we go about producing these results is paramount to me. Said differently, I think often about our purpose and our conduct. And when I think about our purpose and conduct, I think about keeping our people safe and ensuring a fully inclusive work environment. I think about unmatched customer care and giving back to the communities around the globe. As CEO, I'm just so appreciative that our team is squarely hitting the mark in all of these areas, and if our conduct and behavior stands through the year, as I expect it will, we'll have a banner FY '20, a year that will make us all very proud.  Moving on to Slide 6, you'll see a terrific picture, a picture which shows the composition of our commercial portfolio. This picture underscores the effort and effectiveness of our team. Over the past few years, I've repeatedly addressed the deliberate increase to our diversification and the positive impact it has on our business. Diversification is key to our performance. Furthermore, the makeup of our commercial portfolio is special, in fact, intentional and unique when considering the full enterprise.  A bit of our foundational magic which makes the portfolio so powerful comes from our ability to efficiently and quickly share technologies across our various business sectors and do so with little friction. With each passing year, our revenue has become far less dependent on any single product or product family, improving the predictability of our earnings while enhancing our ability to execute. Our performance suggests that our diversification strategy continues to excel and gives us tremendous confidence as we move to the back half of FY '20.  And that brings us to our update for the year. Please turn to Slide 7. Our company is well positioned. As we highlighted in September, we're intensely focused on 3 financial metrics: Margins, earnings and cash flows. We anticipate revenues will be up roughly $1.4 billion year-on-year when compared to fiscal '19. More importantly, we see the income coming through side by side with the increase to revenue. Therefore, core operating income will now be in the neighborhood of $980 million for the year, confirming our core margin target of 3.7%. This improved income outlook for the year translates to $3.60 a share in core earnings, up $0.15 from the outlook we offered in September. Lastly, we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $500 million for the year.  In closing, I smile when considering our total body of work. Progress has been explicit and steady. Strategy has been consistent and disciplined and our path forward is clear. We're ushered ahead by our structure, our team and our culture where the whole is far greater than the simple sum of the parts. I truly believe Jabil is making the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer each and every day, and we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to many of the best brands on the planet.  I want to once again offer a special thanks to our team and acknowledge their near-perfect execution during this past quarter. I feel strongly that our execution will continue as the team is carrying good organizational momentum into the back half of the year.  With that, I'd like to wish everyone on the call a safe and peaceful holiday. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Yes. Thanks, Adam. Nothing has changed since 90 days ago. I think we've got customers to serve. First and foremost, we're going to do everything we can to continue to deliver for shareholders. But we've got really good solutions and services. I think Mike said in his prepared remarks, our DMS revenue came in squarely in line. EMS was up, I don't know, give or take $500 million. $350 million of that was from our cloud services business and about $150 million was kind of scattered across EMS. If I think about the scale of our EMS business, that $150 million is about a 3% uptick, which I think squarely in the air rate of trying to figure out revenue top line with the business so large. And then on the cloud business, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's not just about the uptick for the quarter but how the services are being received in the marketplace.  I think what I'm pleased about is, is unlike some quarters in '19, the income came through and came through nicely with the additional uptick in revenue. So if I just take that $350 million out, and not to make light of the $350 million, I think things are squarely where we thought they would be 90 days ago. And again, what we're driving for, and I think is a good portion of your context is, is consistency. I really like the consistency of the quarter relative to September, beginning year outlook. Steve, let me take a swing. So I would characterize it a couple ways. Let me maybe take it up a level and talk about the enterprise. So I think our center point guide for the quarter was $260 million. We delivered $277 million, uptick of about $17 million. We got about $5 million to $6 million of leverage in DMS on revenue that was really spot on to where our guide was. That's a great tribute to our DMS team.  On the $350 million uptick from cloud as well as the other $150 million across the EMS enterprise, so call it the $500 million, we also got what I would characterize as acceptable leverage. The net-net effect of the EMS leverage though, Steve, we saw some deleverage in 5G. And again, we're still bullish on the 5G rollout. There were some areas during Q1 where we saw a little bit of deleverage, but you shake all that up, and again, I'm really pleased with the income that came through on a net basis with the additional upsides of the EMS revenue. Yes. Thanks again. Yes, I. Don't want to get into too much details around it. But again, kind of overall, speaking firstly with our health care business, our health care business and that whole team continues to just do a really, really nice job with services and solutions into the marketplace. With the collaboration with JJMD specifically, I think what we said multiple times last year was that revenue for this year would be in the range of $800 million to $1 billion. And I think what Mike might have alluded to is I would think that revenue for fiscal year '20 would be on the upper end of that and maybe slightly higher than $1 billion. So in terms of that business, it's going well and we're working really, really hard to serve JJMD. That's true. Yes. I think that's a good point, is in FY '19, I think DMS margins were around 4%. In September, we said there would be about a 10 basis point uptick on DMS margins for FY '20 for the year. So pleased with how things are going, health care overall, JJMD. But again, JJMD is still in what I'd consider kind of a semi transition ramp mode through FY '20 moving into '21. And if you kind of exclude that, DMS margins for the year would be closer to 4.3%., so as Mike said, up 30 basis points year-on-year. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Jim. Okay. That was a lot. So let me try to break that into a couple of pieces. The thing I think we've done a reasonably good job of is we've been very, very consistent in talking about the cloud business. If I think back to fiscal '19, there was a couple of our earnings calls where we actually had a specific slide around the cloud solution as we understood that it can be a little bit confusing. Our -- I would characterize the solution that we're providing as a geocentric asset-light services business. I don't expect the cloud business to go away. I think it's being very well received in the marketplace. And I think we're solving a few different tangential problems with the services and solutions that we're providing, Jim.  The other part of it is the cloud solution that we have is very much a fulfillment model, and so some of it has to do with reducing overall working capital, agility, flexibility in unit configuration. So we've intentionally set that model up, unlike a business that might be a pure white box design, a business that might be more aligned with some of the standard EMS businesses that are more asset-intensive. We've been very thoughtful and the team has been very thoughtful in setting up our cloud business in a very, very asset-light manner.  And so again, the cost and the overall infrastructure can ebb and flow quite nicely with fluctuations in demand. So I don't have a lot of anxiety around some of the demand fluctuations. I think the nice thing is we do anticipate, if there is upside to the business a bit like there was in Q1, I do think that there will be some level of income that will come along with that fluctuation.  In terms of the automotive, one of the things, I think, that our team has done a nice job of is we've been very, very selective in which part of the automotive sector end markets we're choosing to play in. A significant portion of our automotive business is not reliant on what I would call overall automotive sales. So if I think about combustion engines and legacy type of automobiles, our automotive business is more predicated on electrification, the electronic nature of the vehicles and an overall increase in electronic content as well as sensing and sensors. So when I'm thinking about our business, I think a better proxy than overall automotive sales would be what's going on around electrification of vehicles and then overall electrical content. So I hope those answer your questions. Let's go slow, Ruplu. We got a lot of work ahead to deliver this year. I think for now, I would stay firm with the $4 and the 4% margin. And again, the $4 is important. For me, the 4% margin is what we're all focused on. So whether next year in terms of EPS is $3.90, $3.95, $4, $4.05, $4.10, we're really dialed in on the 4% margin. But for now let's keep it at the $4 and 4%. And if things change at all, we'll talk about that more in the March call and the June call. Matt, just to clarify. Are you asking around Q1 or for the year? Yes. So for the year, if you kind of reference back to the green, blue chart that Mike showed, I think we're showing overall mobility roughly flat. We're seeing a nice uptick in health care and packaging, of which a portion of that will be the JJMD collaboration, edge device and lifestyle products. If we look at where we were in September, no change, but year-on-year, that's coming down a bit as we kind of reshape that portfolio. You could think about -- and that kind of covers DMS, Matt. And I think, I think about that as, as we reshape edge device and lifestyle, year-on-year, that coming down $400 million or $500 million, whatever the number is, it's being replaced by some health care and packaging business, which we're pretty excited about.  If I think about kind of puts and takes for EMS for the year, we've taken automotive and semi cap up year-on-year. So last year, I think our automotive, semi cap was in the $2 billion range, maybe just short of that. And we've taken that up to about $2.5 billion for the year. Again, in Suva's question, I talked about kind of the catalyst for automotive, and then we're still staying pat on a semi cap recovery this summer, which has been very consistent with what we said in the September time frame.  And then the other areas are a little bit of an uptick in Industrial & Energy. 5G cloud, again, starting off the year, we saw some lumpiness and some softness in the 5G area. We imagine that will come back. We're still very bullish long term on 5G, but again, I think it'll be with a little bit of choppiness. And then Mike talked in his prepared remarks about the uptick for the quarter in the cloud business. And again, we're early days in that, but it's being well received in the marketplace. And then lastly, we're seeing some weakness on the legacy enterprise customers. I don't want to debate where leverage lies. I think we're heavily, heavy -- heavily reliant on our customers, and I hope we provide great service for them. In terms of -- I don't know why some of our competitors are walking away from business. If it's bad business, I think it's good for our industry if people walk away from things like that. For us, I think we're kind of keeping our head down, sticking to our knitting, if you will, rolling out solutions and services that seem to be well received.  I think I would close my answer to your question with we are not chasing revenue and we are, again, really focused on margin and cash flow. We talked about that through '19. We talked about that in September. So I just want to be clear, if we have customers that are walking away from business that's not good business, you can be 100% sure we're not going to put that sand in our bucket. And again, we're kind of keeping our head down and being sure that we're doing the best job we can to grow, but grow in an area that continues to support our goal of driving 4% margins in '21."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin\nAdam Berry: Good morning and welcome to Jabil\u2019s fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call and investor briefing. We have a great session planned for you today. And as an organization, we are excited to provide you with a little extra detail about our business as typical for our September call. Over the next 60 minutes or so, we will review our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, followed by yet another great outlook for fiscal 2022. As usual, you will hear from both Mark Mondello, our CEO as well as Mike Dastoor, our CFO. Along this journey, we will discuss our approach to the end markets we serve, the uniqueness of our supply chain solutions and the innovation underway within our global network of factories. Additionally, throughout our presentation today, we will do our very best to help you understand what makes Jabil so unique and so special. And we will kick that right off with the following brief video. [Video Presentation]\nAdam Berry: Such a great video. As we all know, the world is complex and only getting more so each and everyday. But as Mark often says, our people are our greatest differentiator and that couldn\u2019t be more apparent as you visit our global network of factories and meet the roughly 260,000 people that make Jabil\u2019s foundation so strong. To our people, thank you again for all you do to help keep the world connected despite a seemingly never endless set of new challenges thrown your way. Our foundation is solid. Through over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space and a 100 plus sites, our people strive to make anything possible and everything better for over 400 of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. Our agility and global scale enable us to respond quickly and flexibly to meet customer needs in key end markets, like mobility, industrial and semi cap, automotive and healthcare, just to name a few. These wide-ranging end markets represent a diverse and thoughtfully designed portfolio that, over the years, has helped reduce volatility and improve the reliability of our financial results. To help illustrate our diversification strategy over the past few years, I\u2019d now ask that you turn to the next slide, which shows our revenue growth and the end markets we serve. As you may know, the EMS industry has long struggled with customer concentration and this dynamic has created a lot of variability in operating performance from 1 year to the next. In 2016, our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably. This important characteristic was product diversification. So, beginning roughly in the 2017 timeframe, we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5G, cloud, healthcare, packaging, connected devices, automotive and semi capital equipment. As a result of our efforts to diversify the business, revenue has grown rapidly. And since 2017, we have added more than $10 billion in revenue across several key end markets. And it\u2019s important to note this growth has been very intentional and focused. Moving to the right side of the chart, you will see the composition of our $29.3 billion in revenue and you\u2019ll likely notice that no end market dominates our diverse portfolio. In each of these areas, Jabil partners with some of the world\u2019s most recognizable companies to accelerate their speed to market through product engineering, supply chain design, and of course, manufacture. In healthcare, think of drug delivery systems, such as inhalers and insulin pens, diagnostics, medical devices, orthopedics and instruments that all meet exacting FDA standards. Our healthcare business serves programs and products with long stable lifecycles of 10 to 20 years with high cost of change, thus providing stable earnings and cash flows. In packaging, we design and manufacture highly engineered rigid plastic packaging for many leading consumer brands, bringing to bear capabilities in ideation, product design, material scientists and eco-friendly barrier technologies. Within mobility and connected devices, we generally focus on machining, tooling and molding of highly engineered plastic and metal parts, leveraging a strong product development skill set. In areas such as digital print and retail, we are focused on 3D print, large form factor printing and retail automation. And in industrial and semi cap, 5G wireless and cloud and networking and storage, we participate in the design, product development, industrialization and manufacturing of some of the most sophisticated tech products on the marketplace today. And then in automotive, the bulk of our business focuses on the electrification of auto supported by a nearly 10-year relationship with the world\u2019s leading EV company. So, from mobility to retail automation to complex heavy industrial implement, Jabil helps customers navigate large complex material supply chains, while effectively managing change, mitigating risks and delivering quickly and efficiently. In summary, our business has grown rapidly over the last several years to serve a diverse blend of end markets that today are benefiting from long-term secular trends. And again, this gives us the confidence and comfort to not only provide financial guidance more than one quarter out, but also invest in things like factory innovation. And when you drill down one level deeper, you will again notice an incredibly diverse set of customers, representing some of the largest most innovative and successful organizations in the world today. This by no means is a complete list of the customers we serve, but it\u2019s certainly impressive by any standard, especially when considering many of these customers rely on Jabil as the sole source for their products. I am sure most of you recognized some of our incredible partners such as Apple, HP, Ericsson, Amazon, Cisco, John Deere, Tesla and J&J. In all of our customer relationships, we are incredibly focused on delivering consistent value and reliable value from early in the product lifecycle, like product innovation and design to more mature products, where we offer planning, automation, supply chain management, and of course, manufacturing. At the end of the day, we build stuff at Jabil and we do it really, really well. This leads me to our financial priorities as a management team. We are squarely focused on three areas: expanding operating margins, increasing earnings per share and generating strong cash flows. In fact, this focus has been further sharpened as we have embedded core margins, core earnings per share and free cash flow within our short-term and long-term compensation programs as we believe this effectively aligns management and shareholders. And over the next several minutes, we plan to provide you with a credible plan to improve all of these three metrics in fiscal \u201822. Following me today will be Mike who joined Jabil in 2000 as a regional controller based in Hong Kong. Mike will walk you through our fiscal \u201821 results and our robust financial plan for fiscal \u201822. He will also spend some time highlighting our end markets and discussing some of the trends, which should drive our business for many years to come. Then Mark, who joined Jabil in 1992 as a manufacturing supervisor, will share some of the value that Jabil provides its customers through our people, our culture and our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities. Before handing the call over to Mike, I\u2019d now ask that you follow our presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with our forward-looking statement. During today\u2019s presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business in the first quarter of fiscal \u201822 and beyond. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you, Adam and thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. As Adam highlighted, our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility. This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end market portfolio over the last several years and in the last 18 months, our strategy has been pressure tested and our diversified, well-balanced portfolio performed extremely well evidenced by our solid Q4 and exceptionally strong FY \u201821 results. In Q4, the teams in both segments successfully managed to navigate an incredibly dynamic supply chain environment. During the quarter, demand continued to be broad-based and robust, but revenue came in slightly lower than expected due to some incremental tightness in the supply chain, mainly in healthcare, industrial and cloud. This was partly offset by upsides in connected devices and networking and storage. Despite this, our core operating margin performance in the quarter was quite strong coming in at 4.2% and approximately 10 basis points higher than expected, a testament to our team\u2019s execution in the quarter, solid cost optimization and our ever more resilient end market portfolio. In Q4, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected, which when combined with the strong margin performance allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q4, putting it all together on the next slide. Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.4 billion, up 1% over the prior year quarter. GAAP operating income was $265 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.16. Core operating income during the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q4 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 22.3%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.44, a 47% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our fourth quarter segment results on the next slide, revenue for our DMS segment was $3.9 billion, an increase of 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses. Core margins for the segment came in at 4.1% 20 basis points higher than the previous year. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.5 billion, down 6.4% and primarily driven by our previously announced transition to a consignment model. Core margin for the segment was 4.3%, up 120 basis points over the prior year reflecting solid execution by the team. For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $15.4 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up an impressive 49% year-over-year. This resulted in core margins expanding 110 basis points to 4.8%, reflective of our improved mix. EMS for the year, core margins were also up strong, coming in at 3.7%, 100 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $13.9 billion. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet, net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $202 million and for the full fiscal year came in better than expected at $793 million or 2.7% of net revenue. We sometimes hear from investors seeking clarification on our net CapEx, so I\u2019d like to take a moment to walk you through the components. As a reminder, our customers sometimes co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then subsequently reimbursed to us by customers. The line item acquisition of property, plant and equipment on our statement of cash flows includes the full upfront payment made by us. The reimbursements by our customers are reflected as a sale of assets in the line item proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant and equipment on our statement of cash flows. The net of these two items reflects our true spend and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. In Q4, inventory days came in higher than expected at 71 days, an increase of 3 days sequentially, driven by the previously mentioned incremental tightness in the supply chain. While these higher inventory days may continue in the short term, we expect it to normalize below 60% over the mid- to longer term. The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment. In spite of this, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $762 million. As a result of the strong fourth quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $640 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4x and cash balances of $1.6 billion. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY \u201821 to 8.8 million shares or $477 million. This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY \u201813 to approximately 90 million shares at an average price under $27 a bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $3 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. In summary, I am extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal \u201821. Next, I\u2019d like to take a few moments to highlight Jabil\u2019s unique position across multiple end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends and the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives. We believe these trends will continue to drive sustainable growth and margins across the enterprise in FY \u201822 and beyond. In healthcare today on the next slide, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare and emerging markets and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently, we\u2019re witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We continue to be in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. Our strategic collaboration, which we have highlighted in previous years has enhanced our credibility within the industry and has further enabled Jabil to benefit from this outsourcing trend. On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity, digitization and personalized care across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products which help our customers excel in today\u2019s evolution of healthcare, another end market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies as the automotive market. Climate change, fuel efficiency and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result, OEMs are making substantial investments into electrification efforts. The bulk of our automotive business is focused on electrification of cars, which we believe still has plenty of room to grow. Over the next 3 years, we expect the fastest-growing area of our auto business will be in what\u2019s known as ACE: autonomous, connectivity and electrification. Today, electric vehicles account for a small fraction of total vehicles in the market, but the ED segment overall is growing rapidly and gaining a larger share of the total vehicle market. Jabil\u2019s longstanding capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space have positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend. We are also extremely well positioned to build the infrastructure that will power tomorrow, be it cloud, semi cap, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices, all power generation and energy storage. 5G is expected to transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with the devices, which will be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This, coupled with the value proposition, Jabil offers cloud hyperscalers is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last 3 years. In power generation and energy storage, we offer differentiated solutions across the entire energy value chain from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings. In this space, we serve a diversified set of customers across numerous markets, including oil and gas, wind, power inverters and converters, smart meters, smart grid communications, building automation, home automation and energy storage. As the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives accelerates, demand for semiconductors has increased exponentially, which has generated a huge backlog in this industry. Jabil is well-positioned to help customers in the semi-cap space with end solutions spanning the front end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back end with validation and test solutions. So what do all these trends translate to in terms of Jabil? You can see our revenue growth expectations by end market in the coming fiscal year. In FY \u201822, in spite of supply chain headwinds, we expect incredibly strong growth in automotive and continued solid growth in healthcare and packaging, industrial, semi cap, 5G wireless and cloud. Today, both segments are in great shape. We\u2019ve repositioned our business to serve critical and long life cycle products while also providing the foundation for predictable yet strong cash flows and margins. For FY \u201822, we expect both gross profit margins and core operating margins to improve 30 basis points over the prior year, mainly driven by our end market growth and improved mix of business. We also expect the investments to be made in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins. We expect these gains will be slightly offset by continued tightness in the supply chain, especially in the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are incredibly confident in our team\u2019s ability to successfully execute in this market given our track record over the last several years. Key to executing amidst an incredibly dynamic environment is our expertise and the investments we made in our IT and supply chain. We\u2019ve got the tools and technologies that allow us to progressively manage with analytics and data, some of the most complex supply chains in the world. This has certainly been evident over the last 2 years. Let\u2019s hear from our supply chain leaders and how they\u2019re executing for our customers. [Video Presentation]\nMike Dastoor: I would like to take a moment to thank the entire supply chain team from the leaders we just heard from to our teams in our factories who have helped our customers navigate through some very complex supply chains. Turning now to our CapEx guidance for FY \u201822, net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $830 million or 2.6% of net revenue. This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth. Let\u2019s talk about our maintenance CapEx for a moment. We now have 100 sites in more than 30 countries. At this scale, our factories require approximately $500 million in annual maintenance investments. Areas of investment are inclusive of IT and data analytics, automation and factory digitization, which will drive innovation across our footprint. This, along with upgrading of our equipment sets based on appropriate cost benefit analysis will improve first pass yields and help reduce ongoing maintenance costs. We are also investing in strategic growth in targeted areas of our business that are expected to deliver strong margin expansion and free cash flow. The bulk of our strategic growth CapEx will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, power generation and energy storage, semi-cap and eco-friendly packaging end markets. All of this positions us well to deliver higher margins as highlighted earlier in my margin waterfall slide. Our improved profitability, strong operational performance and disciplined investments have yielded significant cash flows over the last few years which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business. Moving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows in spite of higher working capital associated with our robust growth in targeted areas I highlighted earlier. This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team\u2019s disciplined approach and ability to execute. In FY \u201822, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $700 million. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve intentionally targeted higher return areas. In doing so, we\u2019re focused on end markets that offer higher profitability and good cash flow dynamics. This discipline has translated to much higher returns on invested capital. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in areas of our business with higher margins, which we expect will translate into strong returns. Another key aspect of delivering higher returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized. Over the last few years, our team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered and at very attractive interest rates. We ended FY \u201821 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe bodes ample flexibility. And importantly, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Turning now to our capital allocation framework, in fiscal \u201822 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, I thought it would be appropriate to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level, how we plan to deploy our capital over the next 2 years. As a reminder, in July earlier this year, we announced a $1 billion buyback authorization from our Board of Directors over the next 2 years. Our capital return framework beyond organic investments will continue to prioritize the commitment to our dividend, share repurchases and a combination of targeted M&A and capital structure optimization. Moving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital. Turning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide, DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 10% on a year-over-year basis to $4.7 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.6 billion, consistent with the prior year. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal \u201822 to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $365 million to $425 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $321 million to $381 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.61. The tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately 25%. As we transition to my final slide, you can really begin to see the earnings power of a diversified and balanced Jabil. Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities. All of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.5% in core margins in FY \u201822 along with $6.35 in core EPS and $700 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. I\u2019d like to thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I\u2019ll begin by saying thanks to all of our employees here at Jabil. Thank you for hanging in there during these trying times. While never compromising the safety of our people, your attitude is amazing and your stamina is incredible. It was your collective body of work that drove the terrific results we just posted. Results you delivered while overcoming COVID quarantine mandates, supply chain challenges, factory inefficiencies and in many cases, a lack of face-to-face interaction. Fiscal \u201821 came in well ahead of plan, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%, all-in-all, a really nice year across all fronts. Today marks our fourth annual investor session a session where we take a little extra time to lay out the groundwork for the upcoming year. As you heard earlier from Adam and Mike, our business is strong and what we\u2019re doing is working. Much of our progress comes from the construct and the pedigree of our company. So let\u2019s start with our approach, beginning with diversity, equity and inclusion. We know that each employee is critical to our success and has the right to be treated with dignity and respect each day and every day. At Jabil, we operate our business in 30 plus countries. We employ people that don\u2019t look the same, don\u2019t talk the same. People that practice different religions, have different sexual orientations, people with physical limitations and neurodiversities. We understand that the current diversity of our team simply makes us better, but we have so much more work to do, and we\u2019re holding ourselves accountable through actions. An example of the type of actions we are taking is the addition of our internal DE&I counsel, which was established in 2020, a 9-person council which guides us and advocates for the broader Jabil. We also co-chaired an external DE&I certification program. A program attended by 165,000 participants, of which the vast majority are in their formal certificates. And one other example is around the upcoming 2022 Special Olympics, where Jabil is a premium sponsor for the U.S. games. And the best part of our partnership with Special Olympics is that it offers our employees the opportunity to spend time with the athletes and their coaches. So in summary, our team continues to safeguard our work environment and does so with the acceptance of individual differences. A second aspect of our approach pertains to the area of ESG, where we aim to always do what\u2019s right. Much like our effort with DE&I, our behavior around ESG is grounded on actions. An example of one of our actions is our greenhouse gas emissions, where our goal is a 25% reduction by 2025 and a 50% reduction by 2030. Another set of actions that we have underway are directed towards our heightened focus on mental health, a topic that impacts most all of us, either directly or indirectly. And one final action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back. Our employees will look to complete 1 million volunteer hours in aggregate during calendar 2022. What a positive difference this will make throughout the communities where we work and we live. As you might sense, DE&I and ESG are important elements of who we are, and they set the foundation for our approach. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about our solutions and how they are enabled by our structure, our investments and our customers. Our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to move with precision and speed. Our investments enable our execution which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary. And our customers enable our obsession, which allows us to solve the complex. So not to be overly simplistic, but at the center of Jabil\u2019s core, we build stuff. That\u2019s just what we do. Therefore, we will continue to be aggressive with our investments in the areas of factory automation, robotics and machine learning. And to help illustrate how we apply and leverage these investments, I\u2019d now like to share a short video. [Video Presentation]\nMark Mondello: Thanks, JJ. Thank you, May. What powerful messages. And to all of our employees that spend long hours on our factory floor day in and day out, thank you. Thank you for taking great care of our customers. As we move to our next slide, you\u2019ll see a colorful pie chart which illustrates the current makeup of our commercial portfolio. Today, our business is diversified and diversified at scale. This provides Jabil a real competitive advantage when we consider the performance and balance of earnings. I\u2019d now like to go a degree deeper into the makeup of our business. These eight sectors exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue, with each sector having a material contribution to our results. We\u2019ve been very diligent in pursuing the end markets we serve. We\u2019ve also spent significant time successfully positioning the company to capture possible tailwinds offered by various secular trends. This portfolio is a wonderful mix of cash flows and margins. And for sure, the composition of our business is a catalyst for our FY \u201822 outlook. As we now look at our plan for fiscal \u201822, you can see the earnings power of the company. We look to deliver a core operating margin of 4.5% on revenues of $31.5 billion, a 30 basis point expansion when compared to fiscal \u201821. This translates to $6.35 in core earnings per share or 13% earnings growth year-on-year. In wrapping up our fiscal \u201822 forecast, I\u2019d like to note that our strategy is well understood across the company and what needs to be done is crystal clear. If we take our FY \u201821 results and our FY \u201822 guidance and step back just a bit, this aperture suggests that what we\u2019re doing is in fact working. This slide offers a fantastic backdrop to our ongoing story. All in all, I feel good about where we\u2019ve been but I feel even better about where we\u2019re going. Moving on from our financials, I\u2019d like to talk a bit about our purpose. As a management team, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost. Our purpose enables our path and does so with an emphasis on caring, integrity and proper intentions.  Speaking of our path, our path forward is formed by the beliefs shown on this slide. For FY \u201822, we will trust in these beliefs as we work to deliver to our commitments. For me, we will measure our success based on financial performance. But we will also measure our success based on keeping our people safe, customer care and improving in the areas of ESG and DE&I. If our team accomplishes all of the above, it will be another year of humble achievement. One additional thought as I wrap up my prepared remarks. As we consider our outlook for fiscal \u201822 and the current trajectory of margins and cash flows, it\u2019s clear that our journey is nowhere near complete. In closing, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress as customers and shareholders remain at the forefront of our actions. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. Most importantly, I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety without harm or recourse. I\u2019m honored to serve such a trustworthy team. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks Mark. As planned, we shared quite a bit over the past hour. To summarize, we began by describing how Jabil has undergone deep and sustainable improvements to its business model. And we highlighted the solid foundation upon which Jabil sits today. Then Mike walked you through our financial results and outlook, which demonstrate the strength of our portfolio, which has been structured to navigate varying fluctuations in demand while also benefiting from long-term secular tailwinds. And finally, Mark shared with you our unique approach, solutions, portfolio and path forward. These truly are exciting times at Jabil. I\u2019d like to thank you for your time, and we appreciate your interest. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks and good morning. Mark, you talked about diversification into secular trends, auto, healthcare, cloud and I couldn\u2019t help but notice reference customers like Tesla, J&J and Amazon. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk through the new customer acquisition efforts, the sales motion to perhaps leverage this reference customer list. And if you could maybe tap into pipeline and timing because I couldn\u2019t help but notice over 40% auto growth expected in fiscal \u201822. I\u2019m wondering if maybe there is some new logos in there? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. I want to get into \u2013 we just \u2013 over the years, we maybe right or wrong, we have a reluctancy or hesitancy to dig too deep into new wins and new customer wins. A lot of that is at the beck and call of the customers themselves. I\u2019d say this just very rough math, right? If you look at kind of fiscal \u201819 to fiscal \u201820, we grew our top line at scale, like 7%, 8%. So in \u201819, we\u2019re just a hair over $25 billion. We took the company to like $27 billion in \u201820. That was a COVID year, as everybody knows. Then we go from \u201820 to \u201821, we had another $2 billion of revenues. That\u2019s another 7%, 8% growth at scale. And now if you take a look at the outline that Mike and I provided outlook for \u201822 is, call it, $31.5 billion. That\u2019s another 7% or 8%. The vast majority of those gains from, say, fiscal \u201818 to fiscal \u201822 are organic in nature. And I would say that our organic pipeline continues to remain awfully robust. Again, we gave a lot of thought to the outlook and how we wanted to guide \u201822. We wanted to be sure we handicapped it appropriately for things like the ongoing supply chain issues. So I \u2013 and when you think about the growth rates on both Mike\u2019s \u2013 I think Mike had three areas where growth rates were double digits. Automotive and transport or transportation was one, I think digital print and retail was one and then the healthcare area. So and then right behind that, we had other areas of growth of the eight sectors that were strong single digits. So I think maybe a way to think about that, Adam, is, I would say, our organic pipeline today on a gross basis is probably $4 billion, $5 billion. Again, as we think about fiscal \u201823 and the maturation and how long it takes to kind of germinate all those organic opportunities. But if we were to divvy that up, I think the \u2013 I think what you\u2019d see is as we got pretty good growth across the board or at least six of the eight sectors. And I do think \u2013 I think I feel like the grossly overused term in the world today is the secular trends. It seems like it\u2019s kind of like back in the day with IoT and digitization and other things. I think it\u2019s used a lot. But I think Mike did a really nice job of hitting some secular trends that, at least for our business where we sit today are very, very real. And we think we will \u2013 all things being equal, will provide some nice tailwinds for us for the next 3 years.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Mark, thanks. And just maybe as a follow-up, Mike, I wanted to touch on normalized free cash flow. I know you\u2019re guiding to $700 million for the year. How much is related to supply constraint or working capital? Because I think if I back into your net income guidance, it\u2019s over $900 million. So wondering how to think about normalized free cash flow?\nMike Dastoor: There is an element of supply chain constraints and the impact on inventory that\u2019s included in that $700 million. I think you\u2019ve got a \u2013 you\u2019ve got to look at it from a growth perspective as well. We\u2019re growing revenue by $2.2 billion over \u201821 to \u201822. That comes with associated working capital as well. So for us to go from 640 to 700 in spite of us growing revenues by $2.2 billion or [8%] (ph) it\u2019s pretty healthy. And I think the management team is fully fully focused on free cash flow. So I feel good. We\u2019re looking at working capital. We\u2019re looking at CapEx. So it will be $700 million, can it go higher if things loosen their grip a little bit on the supply chain constraints? Absolutely. But at this stage, $700 million is a pretty strong free cash flow number, I think.\nMark Mondello: Adam, if I could interject, I think \u2013 and listening to Mike respond to that, if you do think about the growth we\u2019ve been on largely organic, the working capital needs and then you do think we\u2019ve gotten a little bit fluffy on inventory based on the supply chain challenges. As that stuff kind of plays out through fiscal \u201822, if we could imagine fiscal \u201823, there is an opportunity in fiscal \u201823 for us to deliver even stronger cash flows.\nAdam Tindle: Yes, that\u2019s exciting and we will look forward to that. Thank you guys, appreciate it.\nMark Mondello: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Mark, you guys took a much earned victory lap on the diversification story with the presentation. So I was just curious, as we think about diversification going out maybe 2, 3, 4 years, how do you think your mix changes? And what would the impact be on operating margins? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: I don\u2019t know. To try to speculate how it changes, I would tell you that \u2013 we have no intention of \u2013 we\u2019ve been on a journey for 5, 6, 7 years. We\u2019ve talked repeatedly about the fact that back 6, 7 years ago, and I think Adam alluded to it, which I really liked in his prepared remarks in terms of historically in our industry and the industry has changed substantially. But EMS companies would get overweighted on a single customer and I think with that comes to risk. I look at the job our team has done and it\u2019s unbelievable in this one area for sure. And you look at that pie chart that we put up during the presentation, we think diversification is so important again, just because it absolutely drives resiliency. How that might look, how might that look 3, 4, 5 years from now? I can tell you that it will look however it needs to look for us to continue to drive margins and cash flows. And when you look at our business today and you go back to that pie chart in the presentation. There are some slices of that pie chart that deliver both margin and cash flows. There is some parts of that pie chart that deliver very strong cash flows and support margins. And then there is other parts of that pie chart that deliver really good margins and support cash flow. So when I think about the collective tie, if you will, boy, it has us positioned really well. And I do think that hangs with us for the next 2, 3, 4 years.\nSteven Fox: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just secondly, at the risk of using the word secular trend, but the 5G trend is pretty strong. But your connectivity and mobility markets, it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re looking for much growth this year. I was just curious if you could tie those points together and explain that a little bit more. Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Yes. I think there is a couple of things going on there. We\u2019re \u2013 depending on whether you\u2019re looking at a proxy of kind of \u201819, \u201820 to \u201821, \u201822 or you\u2019re looking \u201821 to \u201922, one thing that we\u2019ve transitioned to in that sector is a consignment model, again, that should have \u2013 that will play out by the end of \u201821, early \u201822. So \u2013 and then overall, I think one of the things that\u2019s going on in that marketplace is, I think we\u2019re doing a very, very good job in terms of our solutions and services to hyperscalers and cloud. But the other thing that\u2019s going on there is the \u2013 we were a very, very material partner in terms of wireless infrastructure. And so in some of that as infrastructure comes forward, there is going to be kind of a swap out or a conversion from legacy 2.5G, 3G, LTE, etcetera, to 5G. So on a net revenue basis, maybe the growth rates won\u2019t be as reflective as maybe what you alluded to is, for sure, 5G cloud-based infrastructure, I would agree with you in I think it is a secular trend. But in terms of Jabil\u2019s portfolio, there is going to be kind of a swap out or a conversion of hardware. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I forget the number that Mike put up, but I think the growth rate in that area was like strong single digits, which, by the way, we really like. But I think that\u2019s the main reason for it. We are we are positioned very, very well for anything to do with wireless 5G cloud infrastructure type of secular trends, we\u2019re positioned very, very well.\nMike Dastoor: And Steve, if I could just add a little bit on the mobility piece. We\u2019ve been pushing for diversification as a company. We\u2019ve been pushing for diversification from a product standpoint, we think we\u2019re getting there. We\u2019re being extremely disciplined on CapEx and on our free cash flow. So I think the mobility piece, the lack of growth there is something we watch very carefully and it\u2019s something we\u2019re actually pushing towards.\nSteven Fox: Great. Thant\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.\nMark Mondello: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Regarding the challenges in the supply chain, kind of where you sit today, is it kind of stabilizing a little bit or getting incrementally better or incrementally more challenged? And the reason why I ask is, hopefully, COVID at some point gets behind us. But you also now hear discussions about power outages in China and rating of power and things like that. Are those impacting you or \u2013 how should we think about that and relative to your outlook? Is it kind of the same amount of cushion or are you building in a little bit more? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim. I don\u2019t know where to start with that. I would say we\u2019ve \u2013 as we\u2019ve indexed through \u201821, you take a look at every single quarter, Mike and I get together along with Steve Borges, Mike Loparco, Kenny Wilson, our ops group, and we kind of hold hands, look hard, hard at the business. And then risk adjust accordingly, give guidance and then work really hard to deliver to our guidance and our commitments. I think we did that really, really well, Q1, Q2, Q3. And in fact, we kind of topped off revenue to the upside in each of those quarters. Q4, if I look back on that, maybe we should have risk adjusted a little bit differently back in June. But boy, we certainly felt good about our guide. And then what happened, Jim, is literally 2, 3 weeks after our call in June, the supply chain issues inside of our 4Q just we saw incremental tightness, and I think Mike used that term. And I think that term is very reflective of exactly the kind of the situation and the way the world look to us as we march through most of the fourth quarter as we sit today and we gave a lot of very, very careful thought in terms of our outlook for the $31.5 billion that we have in our outlook for \u201822 again, a 7%, 8% upside, the $6.35 in core EPS, again, a substantial uplift to the $5.61 for \u201821. The cash flows. And then I think as important or more importantly than any of those is the 4.5% margin and the trajectory in margins. We spent a lot of time talking through COVID variants. We spent a lot of time talking through every single element of supply chain risk, and we did our best to handicap that. So I \u2013 when does the fever break on that? It\u2019s really hard to tell because I think it\u2019s going to be a combination of the demand and the supply side. Does demand start to soften a bit? Does the supply start to strengthen a bit, and there is a significant amount of variables there. The way that we think about it is, we think our first quarter and second quarter of fiscal \u201822, we are going to still see tightness about equivalent to what we saw in the last 2 months of \u201821, so very tight supplying components Q1, Q2 of \u201822. We think that \u2013 our estimate is \u2013 and Frank Mackay said in our supply chain video that you just saw, I think our team is rated well to have strong opinions on the supply chain because of the 400 customers we serve, our geographic landscape and just the amount of overall parts we buy. I think that things will start to maybe move in a better direction as we get into the back half of $22 million we\u2019re, by no means, suggesting that the supply chain is back to normalized levels by the back half of the year. But again, just to be repetitive because I think it\u2019s that important. Q1, Q2, we\u2019ve kind of handicapped those with the same level of tightness that we experienced in July and August as we rounded out FY \u201821. And we think things will get a bit better as we get into the back half of \u201822, if demand holds and we\u2019re working through this solely on the supply side then I would think that we don\u2019t see normal conditions in the supply chain until we get into maybe the first half of \u201823, the way things sit today. The one thing, Jim, and I think Mike said this in during his prepared remarks, when we showed the supply chain video, for us to have delivered a year in \u201821, where top line was up 7%, 8% in this marketplace. It\u2019s congrats to the entire team. But boy, the job our supply chain folks have done in the last 6 to 8 months is outstanding.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details.\nMark Mondello: Yes. You are welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I think I heard in the prepared remarks something about a change in the compensation program to focus more on operating margins, cash flows and EPS. Mark, you\u2019re guiding about 30 basis points improvement in operating margin overall for fiscal \u201822 and also to $31 billion plus in terms of revenues. But going forward, should we take this as an indication that there is more focus now on margins versus revenue growth? And in that vein, can you remind us what is the long-term range for margins for DMS as well as the EMS segment? I mean you are projecting 5% operating margin for DMS for fiscal \u201822. How much more upside do you think there is in that segment? And the same question for EMS, I mean, 3.8% margins in fiscal \u201822. How should investors think about the long-term range for that segment?\nMark Mondello: Okay, Ruplu, there was a lot there. Let me process for a second and figure out which order I want to try to address that. So, if I forget something, bring me back because there is a lot of content and a short question. Let me start with compensation. So, I think we are a company led by our Board and highly, highly supported by myself and Mike, where we have a huge belief in pay for performance. And I don\u2019t know if Adam said change in comp or alluded to comp, and I don\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t listening that closely to that portion of his prepared remarks. But for sure, I think what Adam was communicating is when it comes to our leadership team and our management team, we absolutely want a significant amount of our compensation tied to the commitments we are making to shareholders and customers. And we have had that mindset for many years. I think that what you would see in the forward proxy, if I had to guess, is you will see another year where the commitments that we are making to everybody on this call and our shareholders specifically in terms of the 4.5% margin, the $700 million in cash flow and then the $6.35 in EPS. I think you will see those firmly embedded in our compensation plans. In terms of where margins might go, I think again, as we have talked about many, many times, starting 2 years ago, there is just a \u2013 there is an intense focus on we love the portfolio that we have. I will say it again, being well diversified with some of the greatest brands on the planet across eight different sectors has given us a foundation inside the company that we love. And with that foundation, it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know a goofy analogy would be built in the house. You can have a really nice kitchen and really firm walls. If you don\u2019t have a firm foundation, it doesn\u2019t last very long. And I think I would bring that up because our commercial portfolio, the way it exists today is really the foundation of the company. And then you add to it some of the things that we talked about in prepared remarks, you would look at our structure, you look at our team, you look at our approach. Those would be the walls and the trust is in the roof of the Jabil house. And from that, I think that we took margins up. We took \u2013 when we were building the foundation, our margin ranges were around \u2013 the core op margins were as an enterprise were around 3.5%. And we came into \u201821, in fact, it was a year ago now where we made a commitment and gave an outlook to everybody to say, we think we can deliver 4% this year, and we end up delivering 20 basis points higher than that at 4.2%. And now what we are sitting is, is saying, okay, we think we can stretch that 30 basis points in \u201822 to get to 4.5%. And again, I would suggest that all that\u2019s around just the foundational strength of the company. Again, as well as solutions approach, structuring team. And then I said something in my prepared remarks around, I think we have got more to do and maybe there is two parts of that comment. For sure, we have got a lot of hard work ahead of us to deliver what I think is a very appropriate outlook for \u201822. So therefore, that\u2019s kind of derivative number one of my comment on we got more to do. But a big part of why I made the comment on more to do has to do with fiscal \u201823 and \u201824. And I would like to see us and hope that we can keep the positive trajectory on margins and drive margins past the 4.5%. In terms of DMS, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to get into that breakdown now. I think your math is correct. And I validated the math on one of the blue green slides that I think the one I showed that we think diversified will be 5% this year. Given a range to that, I don\u2019t know. We kind of have thoughts in our head and \u2013 but I look at the diversified groupings of businesses that Kenny and Steve run. And we have taken that from 3.7% in \u201820 to an outlook now of 5%. I think that expansion is tremendous. And then you look at our legacy business that\u2019s run by Mike Loparco and his team, and we have taken that from 2.7%, and that\u2019s all of EMS. That\u2019s our former high velocity business, etcetera, etcetera. And now we have got an outlook of 3.8%. I don\u2019t know if we get there in \u201822, but we keep doing what we are doing on the legacy kind of EMS side of our business, which, by the way, I think I am doing it a huge disservice to even use the word legacy because the business that we are running on the EMS side of the house today is distinctly different than it looked 5 years ago. But if things went right there, I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t run the electronics side of our business at 4%. So again, you kind of do the math on a weighted average basis and all that, and I think you get margins higher than 4.5% going forward.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great. I mean I appreciate all the details on that. So, thank you for that. For my follow-up, if I can just ask Mike, I think you guided another $330 million, I think for growth CapEx this year. Can you remind us like based on your existing infrastructure, how much revenue can that support today? And then once you have that $330 million of investment, what would be the max revenue that your infrastructure would be able to support? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: Sure, Ruplu. So, the thing \u2013 we look at it from a different perspective, we look at it from an end market perspective because different end markets have different CapEx requirements. It\u2019s not just about existing capacity and forward-looking capacity. I think we have been on a journey. We are continuing on this growth path, the secular trends are very much alive and doing well in Jabil. So, our growth CapEx in that 300-plus range is what will drive our capacity going forward as well. But it\u2019s all over the place, Ruplu, is the simplest answer. It\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t put my hand on a particular what this capacity lapped or this will take us to x dollars of revenue.\nMark Mondello: Hey Ruplu, maybe I could interject. I think I know where you are going with some of that, but one of the things that we had some shareholders climbing all over us 5 years, 6 years ago on having strong opinions around our capital allocation, use of cash and some other things, and that\u2019s how shareholders should be and will be. As I look at the landscape today, I don\u2019t know of a time where we have ever been more diligent in use of cash both internal capital investments, OpEx investments and then returns to shareholders. So, here we sit in the current landscape. A few weeks back, we announced $1 billion, another $1 billion buyback. I think capital returns to shareholders will always be part of our plans in our plans, especially for the next number of years. And then I think about the processes we have inside the company today in terms of the diligence to which we allocate capital internally. And again, these won\u2019t be exact numbers, but it will be directionally correct. We are going from maybe historics where I think our CapEx investments might have been 3.2%, 3.3% of revenue I think Mike had a chart there somewhere that shows CapEx as a percent of revenue down at 2.6%. And I see no reason why we might not even drive that a little bit or drive that a little bit lower. But the other thing that we look at is with that CapEx investments, with their EBITDA, etcetera, etcetera, again, the $700 plus million of free cash flow. And I believe Mike also shared a slide talking about our real ROIC on all-in investments is upwards of 30%. So, we feel pretty good about how closely we are watching each and every penny in terms of both OpEx and CapEx investments.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details and congrats on the strong execution.\nMark Mondello: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I just \u2013 the inflationary pressures that are out there right now and how you are looking at managing them, whether it\u2019s headcount or commodities or logistics as you look to next year as well as going forward. How much do you think is transitory and how much you think is here to stay? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a complicated one, isn\u2019t it? Think about half of the smart people that you listen to suggest it\u2019s transitory and half of the smart people you listen to believes something different. I think the way we are handling it inside the company is we showed \u2013 I would start with, we showed three videos and one of the videos was around kind of the factory investments, automation, factory productivity. And I think factory productivity is something we continually focus on. When you think about the construct of Jabil today, you are talking about a company that has, I don\u2019t know, 55 million square feet of factory space all around the world. So, driving productivity, driving cost optimization. It\u2019s just what we do. It\u2019s integral to what we do. It\u2019s \u2013 and a lot of that effort year-in and year-out is to offset wage increase, inflationary costs. It keeps us competitive. It allows us to offer customers cost reductions when appropriate. We eliminate waste. But the other thing that\u2019s happening with all of that is the fact that a big part of those efforts are also helping with our margin expansion. So again, I think it was my response to either Jim or Ruplu. We will continue to obsess about taking great customer \u2013 great care of our customers and at the same time keeping our people safe. That\u2019s at the forefront along with the purpose that I talked about in my prepared remarks. If we do that, then I think the financial returns come along with that. But one of the things that adds a little bit of complexity to it is the dynamics around inflationary costs. I think that we have done a good job having long conversations around what we think those could be. How much of that will be offset by the factory productivity and cost management. I think we have been very aggressive going into \u201822 in terms of our base cost because that\u2019s directly inside of our control. And again, I think that\u2019s fully embedded in our FY \u201822 guide. What we are trying to do is we are trying to do our part in serving our customers in an environment that, at least currently has inflation embedded in it. Whether that goes beyond \u201822 or not, I don\u2019t know.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then just one specific, I am just wondering, the 13% growth in digital print and retail, does that return to normal or what\u2019s driving that? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s returned to normal. I think our digital \u2013 let me make a comment that will be inaccurate in some ways, but it will give you an idea of what I am trying to get at. A number of years ago, when we would talk about print as a business or a sector, you would think about print. So, you think about putting income paper and this out and the other. And by the way, that\u2019s still a very important aspect to that business. But when we look at digital print and retail today, there is a reason that we use the term digital. I think I said earlier, it\u2019s an overused term and so maybe we are overusing it too. But I think it\u2019s so appropriate in this business sector from the standpoint of when we look at what\u2019s in that sector today, along with whether it would be any type of office printing or large form factor printing. I also think about digitization and mobile printing. I think about scanners and printing in terms of factory efficiencies. If inflation is here to stay, factory productivity, warehouse productivity, retail productivity is going to be hugely important. Because dollar-for-dollar, all of that effort is going to help to offset passing on inflationary cost to customers, which for those businesses and those customers is going to be huge in terms of them protecting their cash flows and margins. So, we are doing a ton in that area. And then the other area is Fred McCoy and his team who oversee that sector of our business, they are doing a bunch of amazing things in terms of kind of the transformation going on in the retail space, in terms of automation. And again, overall productivity optimization and efficiencies, where the retail space connects with the consumer. So, those are the areas that are driving growth in that sector.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So, you called out healthcare where you are seeing acceleration from kind of a small penetration rate of in-sourcing. So, given the kind of attractive margin profiles there, do you expect to see continued structural step-up in margins as we look further out beyond \u201822 as this trend accelerate, given it\u2019s kind of your second largest segment today? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: Sure. So, are we going to see a step up in margin, I don\u2019t know. What I believe is I think that there is a really good opportunity for a step up of margins. If we continue to do our job in the macro holds in blah, blah, blah, I think we are not done at enterprise level margins at 4.5%. And I think that you stated it. It\u2019s interesting, isn\u2019t it, that in FY \u201822, our healthcare and packaging business is now our second largest sector. Oh, by the way, that sector has doubled in size in like 3 years or 4 short years. So, I think this gives me a nice opportunity to give a shout out to Steve Borges and his whole team, what they have done there and then the contributions we are getting from our consumer packaging team. I think that \u2013 maybe Mike or Adam alluded to this. I think that there is a \u2013 maybe a newer found trust between the most awesome healthcare brands out there, whether it be diagnostics, whether it be pharma, whether it be med device, I think that whether it would be by the way, personalized health, personalized healthcare, on body diagnostics and tracking I think that there is a newer found trust with the capabilities that a company like Jabil has today, which again are night and day compared to what we were doing 6 years, 7 years ago, I think that trust will open up more and more conversation around opportunities where maybe they will look a little bit like what we did with JJMD. I think the other thing that plays well for us there is if you can imagine maybe hardware businesses that maybe we take our experience in connected devices and sensors and things like that, and we start leveraging those parts of our business, along with our wireless expertise, etcetera, etcetera, again for personalized healthcare, on-body health monitoring and again, individual medicine, I think that also is going to drive continued growth in the healthcare space for us.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. And then, Mike, on free cash flow, you have hit highest level in 4 fiscal years, despite some higher than usual working cap drag, nice guide for \u201822, and you mentioned some baked-in supply constraints there. So, assume kind of some working cap drag continues, if you could talk about the puts and takes in operating cash and your view on timing of normalization. Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Yes. I think the \u2013 like I said before, I would really feel comfortable with the $700 million free cash flow guidance that we provided for \u201822. I think that discipline in our working capital discipline in our CapEx. All of that continues. Our earnings potential is extremely strong. Our revenue is growing by a couple of billion dollars and that comes with some level of associated working capital. I think over time, as supply chain constraints normalize, I expect the $700 million to go higher if that happens sooner rather than later. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I think at this time, it\u2019s appropriately sort of de-risked at the $700 million level. It can go higher if supply chain constraints ease earlier. And I think that sort of growth level would be possible beyond \u201822 as well.\nPaul Chung: Great. Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks and good morning Mark and Mike. I wanted to get back to an earlier question regarding your strong guide for automotive for FY \u201822, particularly against the backdrop of global production cuts due to the chip shortage. So, is this more of a function of new program wins with existing or new customers and is primarily around EV or are there other growth drivers there such as autonomous safety and entertainment or infotainment? And any color you could add would be great.\nMark Mondello: Well, I think you said it well. I think it\u2019s all of the above. I mean it seems so incongruent that we can sit here in this environment and offer up a presentation, which suggests that our auto and transportation sector is going to go from $2 billion, $2.2 billion in \u201821 and be over $3 billion in \u201822. It may be lacks logic in this environment. But I think you said it well. I think, a, I would start with, we worked with Chad Morley and his team that run that sector and gave a lot of thought to how to handicap or risk adjust that for \u201822. We went through a lot of discussion points around supply chain risk. And for sure, there is risk around silicon and semiconductor supply chain headwinds in automotive as everybody on the call knows. But in doing that, we also looked at kind of our current relationships, new customer relationships. And again, I think a couple of the positive variables there is we started down a path probably 3.5 years, 4 years ago, where we over-indexed hard towards autonomous driving and maybe more accurately, electrification of vehicles. I think Mike had a slide during his presentation, and there is this acronym ACE that Mike alluded to. I have you go back and look at that particular slide because I think it\u2019s \u2013 for a single slide, there is a lot there, and it\u2019s very illustrative of the areas that we are focused on both from an engineering standpoint, a capability standpoint, a design standpoint. So, you take that slide, you combine it with some of the marquee brands that that I think actually Adam showed on a slide under automotive and transportation. And I think you shake all that up, and that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that automotive and transportation sector will be over $3 billion in \u201822.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just for my follow-up, regarding your outlook for the Networking and Storage segment, with your modeling down. Is that a function of end markets outlook or a function of you deemphasizing some programs as you are continuing to focus on higher value add, higher margin areas?\nMark Mondello: It\u2019s both. And I don\u2019t want to at all suggest that networking and storage customers aren\u2019t higher value-add. I think that even though we are indexing networking and storage down I think from what was like $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion in \u201821, down to like $2.6 million in \u201822, that\u2019s not a reflection of most of our customer relationships in that area. That sector is still extremely material for us. And more than anything, that sector, although margins arguably are very tight in that sector for us, it comes off of some of the long-lasting legacy brands. The cash flows on that sector are very good. And again, it has a very, very integral part to our overall composition and forward-looking for \u201822 and \u201823 in terms of appropriate contributions to the overall financial returns of the company. So, I think that kind of gives you an idea of why that might look like it looks.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Thanks very much.\nMark Mondello: Yes. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. A number of companies have talked about trying to improve the resiliency of their supply chains going forward in terms of inventory management strategies, adding new suppliers and so think there will be opportunities for Jabil as a result of that. Can you talk about to what extent you are expecting to see any benefits from some of those supply chain resiliency efforts in fiscal \u201822, or is the supply chain still so tight in \u201822 that it\u2019s going to be hard to implement any of those sort of improvements and that\u2019s perhaps more of an opportunity for Jabil in fiscal \u201823 and beyond?\nMark Mondello: I think in the near-term, there is little to no opportunities because we are scratching clan, fighting day in and pay out just to get the parts we need to build the products to hit our commitments. So, in the near-term, it\u2019s kind of hand-to-hand combat and very tactical in nature. Oh, by the way, if we are going to be in hand-to-hand combat and it\u2019s going to be very tactical in nature, I will take our supply chain team every day. So again, I think that\u2019s kind of the \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the fogginess on the horizon right now. And I think I alluded to it earlier, I think we are in that stage. Certainly, the first half of \u201822 could be a little bit longer. What I then think happens, assuming that the macro holds and assuming the world is still somewhat round and assuming that \u2013 because of that, there is still decent demand. Then maybe there is a little bit of an uptick as pipelines are getting filled as people think about supply chains, again, I don\u2019t think it will be a good idea if the reaction to all of this. But we have been through this before. We went through the tech rec. We went through the financial crisis. We have been through these ebbs and flows. I think there will be maybe a period of time where there will be a rebuilding of inventory and maybe that provides kind of a small degree of upside over a small timeframe. But I think that I don\u2019t think building inventory and having redundancies here and there are a good solution. I think a better solution is we invest, I don\u2019t know the exact number, but we invest, call it, $250 million, $300 million of OpEx a year. And a portion of those investments are around very sophisticated supply chain tools, data analytics. And I think Jabil continuing to invest in tools like that. So that we can go back and challenge customers in terms of historical behavior, forward-looking forecasts and do it with kind of, again, data analytics and a higher degree of sophistication from an IT standpoint. I think tools like that will become more and more valuable. And then you add to it the fact that we are going to connect those tools to what we are doing in our factories in terms of machine learning, robotics and automation. And you think about that inside of a company like Jabil that will be bumping up against $34 billion, $35 billion in scale factories all over the globe. I think the way we are thinking about that, boy, we are going to be really well positioned to help a lot of the customers we serve in terms of how to further optimize supply chains going forward.\nMark Delaney: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And for my second question was on the EMS segment margins in the fourth quarter. The company already spoke to the reasons for the strength in margins on a year-over-year basis. But I was hoping you could touch on the reasons for strength on a sequential basis, revenue was slightly down quarter-to-quarter, but margins were up nicely, maybe it\u2019s the same reason around the inventory strategy with cloud, but perhaps something else on a quarter-to-quarter basis? And if so, I was hoping to better understand what it may be. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes, sure, Mark. I think the year-on-year comp is distorted because Q4 of \u201820, we were still wrestling around with COVID stuff. And I think all our metrics in \u201820 were distorted to the downside. This isn\u2019t intentional, but we have kind of \u2013 the way \u2013 this is more coincidental than anything. So, the way the construct of Mike\u2019s and his team\u2019s electronics business stacks up is, is the \u2013 it just aligns with the fact that our 4Q ends up typically being stronger for that part of our business. And that\u2019s not an intentional thing. That\u2019s just \u2013 that\u2019s how we run our business from a bottoms-up makeup. So, I think what you are seeing \u2013 I think what you saw in the fourth quarter was just a repeat of, again, another strong 4Q by the electronics side of our business. And in fact, if you kind of map what we said for \u201822, we kind of gave you \u2013 we kind of gave you everything you need to map out Q1. If you think about the fact that we believe \u2013 and I think we gave you the full year. So, I think revenue for \u201822, first half to second half is going to be about 50-50 for the company. You will probably be able to get to some math that says, once again, we think our electronics business in terms of margin will be stronger in the second half of \u201822 and probably strongest in the fourth quarter. And again, that\u2019s really just a makeup of customer sectors and markets and it happens to fall into our fourth quarter. What I am more interested in, for sure, is we have an electronics business that if you just go back to I don\u2019t know, like fiscal \u201819, the electronics part of our business, the way we define it today was in the 2.9%, 3% range all in. And I am most interested in our ability to try to get that part of our business bumping up against 4% margins. By the way, and \u2013 the numbers that we just \u2013 we offered during the presentation, which also has a high degree of satisfaction, if we can execute because I think we gave you numbers that would suggest that, that part of our business is going to grow nearly 5% on the top line. And so with that growth, at that scale, if we can get that part of our business bumping up against 4%, boy, that does wonders for our overall portfolio.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to all of our employees here at Jabil. Thank you for hanging in there during these trying times. While never compromising the safety of our people, your attitude is amazing and your stamina is incredible. It was your collective body of work that drove the terrific results we just posted. Results you delivered while overcoming COVID quarantine mandates, supply chain challenges, factory inefficiencies and in many cases, a lack of face-to-face interaction. Fiscal \u201821 came in well ahead of plan, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%, all-in-all, a really nice year across all fronts. Today marks our fourth annual investor session a session where we take a little extra time to lay out the groundwork for the upcoming year. As you heard earlier from Adam and Mike, our business is strong and what we're doing is working. Much of our progress comes from the construct and the pedigree of our company. So let's start with our approach, beginning with diversity, equity and inclusion. We know that each employee is critical to our success and has the right to be treated with dignity and respect each day and every day. At Jabil, we operate our business in 30 plus countries. We employ people that don't look the same, don't talk the same. People that practice different religions, have different sexual orientations, people with physical limitations and neurodiversities. We understand that the current diversity of our team simply makes us better, but we have so much more work to do, and we're holding ourselves accountable through actions. An example of the type of actions we are taking is the addition of our internal DE&I counsel, which was established in 2020, a 9-person council which guides us and advocates for the broader Jabil. We also co-chaired an external DE&I certification program. A program attended by 165,000 participants, of which the vast majority are in their formal certificates. And one other example is around the upcoming 2022 Special Olympics, where Jabil is a premium sponsor for the U.S. games. And the best part of our partnership with Special Olympics is that it offers our employees the opportunity to spend time with the athletes and their coaches. So in summary, our team continues to safeguard our work environment and does so with the acceptance of individual differences. A second aspect of our approach pertains to the area of ESG, where we aim to always do what's right. Much like our effort with DE&I, our behavior around ESG is grounded on actions. An example of one of our actions is our greenhouse gas emissions, where our goal is a 25% reduction by 2025 and a 50% reduction by 2030. Another set of actions that we have underway are directed towards our heightened focus on mental health, a topic that impacts most all of us, either directly or indirectly. And one final action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back. Our employees will look to complete 1 million volunteer hours in aggregate during calendar 2022. What a positive difference this will make throughout the communities where we work and we live. As you might sense, DE&I and ESG are important elements of who we are, and they set the foundation for our approach. Next, I'd like to talk about our solutions and how they are enabled by our structure, our investments and our customers. Our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to move with precision and speed. Our investments enable our execution which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary. And our customers enable our obsession, which allows us to solve the complex. So not to be overly simplistic, but at the center of Jabil's core, we build stuff. That's just what we do. Therefore, we will continue to be aggressive with our investments in the areas of factory automation, robotics and machine learning. And to help illustrate how we apply and leverage these investments, I'd now like to share a short video. [Video Presentation] Thanks, JJ. Thank you, May. What powerful messages. And to all of our employees that spend long hours on our factory floor day in and day out, thank you. Thank you for taking great care of our customers. As we move to our next slide, you'll see a colorful pie chart which illustrates the current makeup of our commercial portfolio. Today, our business is diversified and diversified at scale. This provides Jabil a real competitive advantage when we consider the performance and balance of earnings. I'd now like to go a degree deeper into the makeup of our business. These eight sectors exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue, with each sector having a material contribution to our results. We've been very diligent in pursuing the end markets we serve. We've also spent significant time successfully positioning the company to capture possible tailwinds offered by various secular trends. This portfolio is a wonderful mix of cash flows and margins. And for sure, the composition of our business is a catalyst for our FY \u201822 outlook. As we now look at our plan for fiscal \u201822, you can see the earnings power of the company. We look to deliver a core operating margin of 4.5% on revenues of $31.5 billion, a 30 basis point expansion when compared to fiscal \u201821. This translates to $6.35 in core earnings per share or 13% earnings growth year-on-year. In wrapping up our fiscal \u201822 forecast, I'd like to note that our strategy is well understood across the company and what needs to be done is crystal clear. If we take our FY \u201821 results and our FY \u201822 guidance and step back just a bit, this aperture suggests that what we're doing is in fact working. This slide offers a fantastic backdrop to our ongoing story. All in all, I feel good about where we've been but I feel even better about where we're going. Moving on from our financials, I'd like to talk a bit about our purpose. As a management team, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost. Our purpose enables our path and does so with an emphasis on caring, integrity and proper intentions.  Speaking of our path, our path forward is formed by the beliefs shown on this slide. For FY \u201822, we will trust in these beliefs as we work to deliver to our commitments. For me, we will measure our success based on financial performance. But we will also measure our success based on keeping our people safe, customer care and improving in the areas of ESG and DE&I. If our team accomplishes all of the above, it will be another year of humble achievement. One additional thought as I wrap up my prepared remarks. As we consider our outlook for fiscal \u201822 and the current trajectory of margins and cash flows, it's clear that our journey is nowhere near complete. In closing, we've made tremendous progress as customers and shareholders remain at the forefront of our actions. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. Most importantly, I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety without harm or recourse. I'm honored to serve such a trustworthy team. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Adam. Thanks, Adam. I want to get into \u2013 we just \u2013 over the years, we maybe right or wrong, we have a reluctancy or hesitancy to dig too deep into new wins and new customer wins. A lot of that is at the beck and call of the customers themselves. I'd say this just very rough math, right? If you look at kind of fiscal \u201819 to fiscal \u201820, we grew our top line at scale, like 7%, 8%. So in \u201819, we're just a hair over $25 billion. We took the company to like $27 billion in \u201820. That was a COVID year, as everybody knows. Then we go from \u201820 to \u201821, we had another $2 billion of revenues. That's another 7%, 8% growth at scale. And now if you take a look at the outline that Mike and I provided outlook for \u201822 is, call it, $31.5 billion. That's another 7% or 8%. The vast majority of those gains from, say, fiscal \u201818 to fiscal \u201822 are organic in nature. And I would say that our organic pipeline continues to remain awfully robust. Again, we gave a lot of thought to the outlook and how we wanted to guide \u201822. We wanted to be sure we handicapped it appropriately for things like the ongoing supply chain issues. So I \u2013 and when you think about the growth rates on both Mike's \u2013 I think Mike had three areas where growth rates were double digits. Automotive and transport or transportation was one, I think digital print and retail was one and then the healthcare area. So and then right behind that, we had other areas of growth of the eight sectors that were strong single digits. So I think maybe a way to think about that, Adam, is, I would say, our organic pipeline today on a gross basis is probably $4 billion, $5 billion. Again, as we think about fiscal \u201823 and the maturation and how long it takes to kind of germinate all those organic opportunities. But if we were to divvy that up, I think the \u2013 I think what you'd see is as we got pretty good growth across the board or at least six of the eight sectors. And I do think \u2013 I think I feel like the grossly overused term in the world today is the secular trends. It seems like it's kind of like back in the day with IoT and digitization and other things. I think it's used a lot. But I think Mike did a really nice job of hitting some secular trends that, at least for our business where we sit today are very, very real. And we think we will \u2013 all things being equal, will provide some nice tailwinds for us for the next 3 years. Adam, if I could interject, I think \u2013 and listening to Mike respond to that, if you do think about the growth we've been on largely organic, the working capital needs and then you do think we've gotten a little bit fluffy on inventory based on the supply chain challenges. As that stuff kind of plays out through fiscal \u201822, if we could imagine fiscal \u201823, there is an opportunity in fiscal \u201823 for us to deliver even stronger cash flows. Yes, thanks. I don't know. To try to speculate how it changes, I would tell you that \u2013 we have no intention of \u2013 we've been on a journey for 5, 6, 7 years. We've talked repeatedly about the fact that back 6, 7 years ago, and I think Adam alluded to it, which I really liked in his prepared remarks in terms of historically in our industry and the industry has changed substantially. But EMS companies would get overweighted on a single customer and I think with that comes to risk. I look at the job our team has done and it's unbelievable in this one area for sure. And you look at that pie chart that we put up during the presentation, we think diversification is so important again, just because it absolutely drives resiliency. How that might look, how might that look 3, 4, 5 years from now? I can tell you that it will look however it needs to look for us to continue to drive margins and cash flows. And when you look at our business today and you go back to that pie chart in the presentation. There are some slices of that pie chart that deliver both margin and cash flows. There is some parts of that pie chart that deliver very strong cash flows and support margins. And then there is other parts of that pie chart that deliver really good margins and support cash flow. So when I think about the collective tie, if you will, boy, it has us positioned really well. And I do think that hangs with us for the next 2, 3, 4 years. Yes. I think there is a couple of things going on there. We're \u2013 depending on whether you're looking at a proxy of kind of \u201819, \u201820 to \u201821, \u201822 or you're looking \u201821 to '22, one thing that we've transitioned to in that sector is a consignment model, again, that should have \u2013 that will play out by the end of \u201821, early \u201822. So \u2013 and then overall, I think one of the things that's going on in that marketplace is, I think we're doing a very, very good job in terms of our solutions and services to hyperscalers and cloud. But the other thing that's going on there is the \u2013 we were a very, very material partner in terms of wireless infrastructure. And so in some of that as infrastructure comes forward, there is going to be kind of a swap out or a conversion from legacy 2.5G, 3G, LTE, etcetera, to 5G. So on a net revenue basis, maybe the growth rates won't be as reflective as maybe what you alluded to is, for sure, 5G cloud-based infrastructure, I would agree with you in I think it is a secular trend. But in terms of Jabil's portfolio, there is going to be kind of a swap out or a conversion of hardware. So I don't \u2013 I forget the number that Mike put up, but I think the growth rate in that area was like strong single digits, which, by the way, we really like. But I think that's the main reason for it. We are we are positioned very, very well for anything to do with wireless 5G cloud infrastructure type of secular trends, we're positioned very, very well. Thank you. Thanks, Jim. I don't know where to start with that. I would say we've \u2013 as we've indexed through \u201821, you take a look at every single quarter, Mike and I get together along with Steve Borges, Mike Loparco, Kenny Wilson, our ops group, and we kind of hold hands, look hard, hard at the business. And then risk adjust accordingly, give guidance and then work really hard to deliver to our guidance and our commitments. I think we did that really, really well, Q1, Q2, Q3. And in fact, we kind of topped off revenue to the upside in each of those quarters. Q4, if I look back on that, maybe we should have risk adjusted a little bit differently back in June. But boy, we certainly felt good about our guide. And then what happened, Jim, is literally 2, 3 weeks after our call in June, the supply chain issues inside of our 4Q just we saw incremental tightness, and I think Mike used that term. And I think that term is very reflective of exactly the kind of the situation and the way the world look to us as we march through most of the fourth quarter as we sit today and we gave a lot of very, very careful thought in terms of our outlook for the $31.5 billion that we have in our outlook for \u201822 again, a 7%, 8% upside, the $6.35 in core EPS, again, a substantial uplift to the $5.61 for \u201821. The cash flows. And then I think as important or more importantly than any of those is the 4.5% margin and the trajectory in margins. We spent a lot of time talking through COVID variants. We spent a lot of time talking through every single element of supply chain risk, and we did our best to handicap that. So I \u2013 when does the fever break on that? It's really hard to tell because I think it's going to be a combination of the demand and the supply side. Does demand start to soften a bit? Does the supply start to strengthen a bit, and there is a significant amount of variables there. The way that we think about it is, we think our first quarter and second quarter of fiscal \u201822, we are going to still see tightness about equivalent to what we saw in the last 2 months of \u201821, so very tight supplying components Q1, Q2 of \u201822. We think that \u2013 our estimate is \u2013 and Frank Mackay said in our supply chain video that you just saw, I think our team is rated well to have strong opinions on the supply chain because of the 400 customers we serve, our geographic landscape and just the amount of overall parts we buy. I think that things will start to maybe move in a better direction as we get into the back half of $22 million we're, by no means, suggesting that the supply chain is back to normalized levels by the back half of the year. But again, just to be repetitive because I think it's that important. Q1, Q2, we've kind of handicapped those with the same level of tightness that we experienced in July and August as we rounded out FY \u201821. And we think things will get a bit better as we get into the back half of \u201822, if demand holds and we're working through this solely on the supply side then I would think that we don't see normal conditions in the supply chain until we get into maybe the first half of \u201823, the way things sit today. The one thing, Jim, and I think Mike said this in during his prepared remarks, when we showed the supply chain video, for us to have delivered a year in \u201821, where top line was up 7%, 8% in this marketplace. It's congrats to the entire team. But boy, the job our supply chain folks have done in the last 6 to 8 months is outstanding. Yes. You are welcome. Thank you. Okay, Ruplu, there was a lot there. Let me process for a second and figure out which order I want to try to address that. So, if I forget something, bring me back because there is a lot of content and a short question. Let me start with compensation. So, I think we are a company led by our Board and highly, highly supported by myself and Mike, where we have a huge belief in pay for performance. And I don't know if Adam said change in comp or alluded to comp, and I don't \u2013 I wasn't listening that closely to that portion of his prepared remarks. But for sure, I think what Adam was communicating is when it comes to our leadership team and our management team, we absolutely want a significant amount of our compensation tied to the commitments we are making to shareholders and customers. And we have had that mindset for many years. I think that what you would see in the forward proxy, if I had to guess, is you will see another year where the commitments that we are making to everybody on this call and our shareholders specifically in terms of the 4.5% margin, the $700 million in cash flow and then the $6.35 in EPS. I think you will see those firmly embedded in our compensation plans. In terms of where margins might go, I think again, as we have talked about many, many times, starting 2 years ago, there is just a \u2013 there is an intense focus on we love the portfolio that we have. I will say it again, being well diversified with some of the greatest brands on the planet across eight different sectors has given us a foundation inside the company that we love. And with that foundation, it's \u2013 I don't know a goofy analogy would be built in the house. You can have a really nice kitchen and really firm walls. If you don't have a firm foundation, it doesn't last very long. And I think I would bring that up because our commercial portfolio, the way it exists today is really the foundation of the company. And then you add to it some of the things that we talked about in prepared remarks, you would look at our structure, you look at our team, you look at our approach. Those would be the walls and the trust is in the roof of the Jabil house. And from that, I think that we took margins up. We took \u2013 when we were building the foundation, our margin ranges were around \u2013 the core op margins were as an enterprise were around 3.5%. And we came into \u201821, in fact, it was a year ago now where we made a commitment and gave an outlook to everybody to say, we think we can deliver 4% this year, and we end up delivering 20 basis points higher than that at 4.2%. And now what we are sitting is, is saying, okay, we think we can stretch that 30 basis points in \u201822 to get to 4.5%. And again, I would suggest that all that's around just the foundational strength of the company. Again, as well as solutions approach, structuring team. And then I said something in my prepared remarks around, I think we have got more to do and maybe there is two parts of that comment. For sure, we have got a lot of hard work ahead of us to deliver what I think is a very appropriate outlook for \u201822. So therefore, that's kind of derivative number one of my comment on we got more to do. But a big part of why I made the comment on more to do has to do with fiscal \u201823 and \u201824. And I would like to see us and hope that we can keep the positive trajectory on margins and drive margins past the 4.5%. In terms of DMS, I don't know, I don't want to get into that breakdown now. I think your math is correct. And I validated the math on one of the blue green slides that I think the one I showed that we think diversified will be 5% this year. Given a range to that, I don't know. We kind of have thoughts in our head and \u2013 but I look at the diversified groupings of businesses that Kenny and Steve run. And we have taken that from 3.7% in \u201820 to an outlook now of 5%. I think that expansion is tremendous. And then you look at our legacy business that's run by Mike Loparco and his team, and we have taken that from 2.7%, and that's all of EMS. That's our former high velocity business, etcetera, etcetera. And now we have got an outlook of 3.8%. I don't know if we get there in \u201822, but we keep doing what we are doing on the legacy kind of EMS side of our business, which, by the way, I think I am doing it a huge disservice to even use the word legacy because the business that we are running on the EMS side of the house today is distinctly different than it looked 5 years ago. But if things went right there, I don't see any reason why we can't run the electronics side of our business at 4%. So again, you kind of do the math on a weighted average basis and all that, and I think you get margins higher than 4.5% going forward. Hey Ruplu, maybe I could interject. I think I know where you are going with some of that, but one of the things that we had some shareholders climbing all over us 5 years, 6 years ago on having strong opinions around our capital allocation, use of cash and some other things, and that's how shareholders should be and will be. As I look at the landscape today, I don't know of a time where we have ever been more diligent in use of cash both internal capital investments, OpEx investments and then returns to shareholders. So, here we sit in the current landscape. A few weeks back, we announced $1 billion, another $1 billion buyback. I think capital returns to shareholders will always be part of our plans in our plans, especially for the next number of years. And then I think about the processes we have inside the company today in terms of the diligence to which we allocate capital internally. And again, these won't be exact numbers, but it will be directionally correct. We are going from maybe historics where I think our CapEx investments might have been 3.2%, 3.3% of revenue I think Mike had a chart there somewhere that shows CapEx as a percent of revenue down at 2.6%. And I see no reason why we might not even drive that a little bit or drive that a little bit lower. But the other thing that we look at is with that CapEx investments, with their EBITDA, etcetera, etcetera, again, the $700 plus million of free cash flow. And I believe Mike also shared a slide talking about our real ROIC on all-in investments is upwards of 30%. So, we feel pretty good about how closely we are watching each and every penny in terms of both OpEx and CapEx investments. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's a complicated one, isn't it? Think about half of the smart people that you listen to suggest it's transitory and half of the smart people you listen to believes something different. I think the way we are handling it inside the company is we showed \u2013 I would start with, we showed three videos and one of the videos was around kind of the factory investments, automation, factory productivity. And I think factory productivity is something we continually focus on. When you think about the construct of Jabil today, you are talking about a company that has, I don't know, 55 million square feet of factory space all around the world. So, driving productivity, driving cost optimization. It's just what we do. It's integral to what we do. It's \u2013 and a lot of that effort year-in and year-out is to offset wage increase, inflationary costs. It keeps us competitive. It allows us to offer customers cost reductions when appropriate. We eliminate waste. But the other thing that's happening with all of that is the fact that a big part of those efforts are also helping with our margin expansion. So again, I think it was my response to either Jim or Ruplu. We will continue to obsess about taking great customer \u2013 great care of our customers and at the same time keeping our people safe. That's at the forefront along with the purpose that I talked about in my prepared remarks. If we do that, then I think the financial returns come along with that. But one of the things that adds a little bit of complexity to it is the dynamics around inflationary costs. I think that we have done a good job having long conversations around what we think those could be. How much of that will be offset by the factory productivity and cost management. I think we have been very aggressive going into \u201822 in terms of our base cost because that's directly inside of our control. And again, I think that's fully embedded in our FY \u201822 guide. What we are trying to do is we are trying to do our part in serving our customers in an environment that, at least currently has inflation embedded in it. Whether that goes beyond \u201822 or not, I don't know. I don't think it's returned to normal. I think our digital \u2013 let me make a comment that will be inaccurate in some ways, but it will give you an idea of what I am trying to get at. A number of years ago, when we would talk about print as a business or a sector, you would think about print. So, you think about putting income paper and this out and the other. And by the way, that's still a very important aspect to that business. But when we look at digital print and retail today, there is a reason that we use the term digital. I think I said earlier, it's an overused term and so maybe we are overusing it too. But I think it's so appropriate in this business sector from the standpoint of when we look at what's in that sector today, along with whether it would be any type of office printing or large form factor printing. I also think about digitization and mobile printing. I think about scanners and printing in terms of factory efficiencies. If inflation is here to stay, factory productivity, warehouse productivity, retail productivity is going to be hugely important. Because dollar-for-dollar, all of that effort is going to help to offset passing on inflationary cost to customers, which for those businesses and those customers is going to be huge in terms of them protecting their cash flows and margins. So, we are doing a ton in that area. And then the other area is Fred McCoy and his team who oversee that sector of our business, they are doing a bunch of amazing things in terms of kind of the transformation going on in the retail space, in terms of automation. And again, overall productivity optimization and efficiencies, where the retail space connects with the consumer. So, those are the areas that are driving growth in that sector. You're welcome. Sure. So, are we going to see a step up in margin, I don't know. What I believe is I think that there is a really good opportunity for a step up of margins. If we continue to do our job in the macro holds in blah, blah, blah, I think we are not done at enterprise level margins at 4.5%. And I think that you stated it. It's interesting, isn't it, that in FY \u201822, our healthcare and packaging business is now our second largest sector. Oh, by the way, that sector has doubled in size in like 3 years or 4 short years. So, I think this gives me a nice opportunity to give a shout out to Steve Borges and his whole team, what they have done there and then the contributions we are getting from our consumer packaging team. I think that \u2013 maybe Mike or Adam alluded to this. I think that there is a \u2013 maybe a newer found trust between the most awesome healthcare brands out there, whether it be diagnostics, whether it be pharma, whether it be med device, I think that whether it would be by the way, personalized health, personalized healthcare, on body diagnostics and tracking I think that there is a newer found trust with the capabilities that a company like Jabil has today, which again are night and day compared to what we were doing 6 years, 7 years ago, I think that trust will open up more and more conversation around opportunities where maybe they will look a little bit like what we did with JJMD. I think the other thing that plays well for us there is if you can imagine maybe hardware businesses that maybe we take our experience in connected devices and sensors and things like that, and we start leveraging those parts of our business, along with our wireless expertise, etcetera, etcetera, again for personalized healthcare, on-body health monitoring and again, individual medicine, I think that also is going to drive continued growth in the healthcare space for us. Thank you. Well, I think you said it well. I think it's all of the above. I mean it seems so incongruent that we can sit here in this environment and offer up a presentation, which suggests that our auto and transportation sector is going to go from $2 billion, $2.2 billion in \u201821 and be over $3 billion in \u201822. It may be lacks logic in this environment. But I think you said it well. I think, a, I would start with, we worked with Chad Morley and his team that run that sector and gave a lot of thought to how to handicap or risk adjust that for \u201822. We went through a lot of discussion points around supply chain risk. And for sure, there is risk around silicon and semiconductor supply chain headwinds in automotive as everybody on the call knows. But in doing that, we also looked at kind of our current relationships, new customer relationships. And again, I think a couple of the positive variables there is we started down a path probably 3.5 years, 4 years ago, where we over-indexed hard towards autonomous driving and maybe more accurately, electrification of vehicles. I think Mike had a slide during his presentation, and there is this acronym ACE that Mike alluded to. I have you go back and look at that particular slide because I think it's \u2013 for a single slide, there is a lot there, and it's very illustrative of the areas that we are focused on both from an engineering standpoint, a capability standpoint, a design standpoint. So, you take that slide, you combine it with some of the marquee brands that that I think actually Adam showed on a slide under automotive and transportation. And I think you shake all that up, and that's what gives us the confidence that automotive and transportation sector will be over $3 billion in \u201822. It's both. And I don't want to at all suggest that networking and storage customers aren't higher value-add. I think that even though we are indexing networking and storage down I think from what was like $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion in \u201821, down to like $2.6 million in \u201822, that's not a reflection of most of our customer relationships in that area. That sector is still extremely material for us. And more than anything, that sector, although margins arguably are very tight in that sector for us, it comes off of some of the long-lasting legacy brands. The cash flows on that sector are very good. And again, it has a very, very integral part to our overall composition and forward-looking for \u201822 and \u201823 in terms of appropriate contributions to the overall financial returns of the company. So, I think that kind of gives you an idea of why that might look like it looks. Yes. You're welcome. I think in the near-term, there is little to no opportunities because we are scratching clan, fighting day in and pay out just to get the parts we need to build the products to hit our commitments. So, in the near-term, it's kind of hand-to-hand combat and very tactical in nature. Oh, by the way, if we are going to be in hand-to-hand combat and it's going to be very tactical in nature, I will take our supply chain team every day. So again, I think that's kind of the \u2013 that's kind of the fogginess on the horizon right now. And I think I alluded to it earlier, I think we are in that stage. Certainly, the first half of \u201822 could be a little bit longer. What I then think happens, assuming that the macro holds and assuming the world is still somewhat round and assuming that \u2013 because of that, there is still decent demand. Then maybe there is a little bit of an uptick as pipelines are getting filled as people think about supply chains, again, I don't think it will be a good idea if the reaction to all of this. But we have been through this before. We went through the tech rec. We went through the financial crisis. We have been through these ebbs and flows. I think there will be maybe a period of time where there will be a rebuilding of inventory and maybe that provides kind of a small degree of upside over a small timeframe. But I think that I don't think building inventory and having redundancies here and there are a good solution. I think a better solution is we invest, I don't know the exact number, but we invest, call it, $250 million, $300 million of OpEx a year. And a portion of those investments are around very sophisticated supply chain tools, data analytics. And I think Jabil continuing to invest in tools like that. So that we can go back and challenge customers in terms of historical behavior, forward-looking forecasts and do it with kind of, again, data analytics and a higher degree of sophistication from an IT standpoint. I think tools like that will become more and more valuable. And then you add to it the fact that we are going to connect those tools to what we are doing in our factories in terms of machine learning, robotics and automation. And you think about that inside of a company like Jabil that will be bumping up against $34 billion, $35 billion in scale factories all over the globe. I think the way we are thinking about that, boy, we are going to be really well positioned to help a lot of the customers we serve in terms of how to further optimize supply chains going forward. Yes, sure, Mark. I think the year-on-year comp is distorted because Q4 of \u201820, we were still wrestling around with COVID stuff. And I think all our metrics in \u201820 were distorted to the downside. This isn't intentional, but we have kind of \u2013 the way \u2013 this is more coincidental than anything. So, the way the construct of Mike's and his team's electronics business stacks up is, is the \u2013 it just aligns with the fact that our 4Q ends up typically being stronger for that part of our business. And that's not an intentional thing. That's just \u2013 that's how we run our business from a bottoms-up makeup. So, I think what you are seeing \u2013 I think what you saw in the fourth quarter was just a repeat of, again, another strong 4Q by the electronics side of our business. And in fact, if you kind of map what we said for \u201822, we kind of gave you \u2013 we kind of gave you everything you need to map out Q1. If you think about the fact that we believe \u2013 and I think we gave you the full year. So, I think revenue for \u201822, first half to second half is going to be about 50-50 for the company. You will probably be able to get to some math that says, once again, we think our electronics business in terms of margin will be stronger in the second half of \u201822 and probably strongest in the fourth quarter. And again, that's really just a makeup of customer sectors and markets and it happens to fall into our fourth quarter. What I am more interested in, for sure, is we have an electronics business that if you just go back to I don't know, like fiscal \u201819, the electronics part of our business, the way we define it today was in the 2.9%, 3% range all in. And I am most interested in our ability to try to get that part of our business bumping up against 4% margins. By the way, and \u2013 the numbers that we just \u2013 we offered during the presentation, which also has a high degree of satisfaction, if we can execute because I think we gave you numbers that would suggest that, that part of our business is going to grow nearly 5% on the top line. And so with that growth, at that scale, if we can get that part of our business bumping up against 4%, boy, that does wonders for our overall portfolio. You're welcome."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam and thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. As Adam highlighted, our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility. This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end market portfolio over the last several years and in the last 18 months, our strategy has been pressure tested and our diversified, well-balanced portfolio performed extremely well evidenced by our solid Q4 and exceptionally strong FY \u201821 results. In Q4, the teams in both segments successfully managed to navigate an incredibly dynamic supply chain environment. During the quarter, demand continued to be broad-based and robust, but revenue came in slightly lower than expected due to some incremental tightness in the supply chain, mainly in healthcare, industrial and cloud. This was partly offset by upsides in connected devices and networking and storage. Despite this, our core operating margin performance in the quarter was quite strong coming in at 4.2% and approximately 10 basis points higher than expected, a testament to our team's execution in the quarter, solid cost optimization and our ever more resilient end market portfolio. In Q4, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected, which when combined with the strong margin performance allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q4, putting it all together on the next slide. Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.4 billion, up 1% over the prior year quarter. GAAP operating income was $265 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.16. Core operating income during the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q4 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 22.3%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.44, a 47% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our fourth quarter segment results on the next slide, revenue for our DMS segment was $3.9 billion, an increase of 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses. Core margins for the segment came in at 4.1% 20 basis points higher than the previous year. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.5 billion, down 6.4% and primarily driven by our previously announced transition to a consignment model. Core margin for the segment was 4.3%, up 120 basis points over the prior year reflecting solid execution by the team. For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $15.4 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up an impressive 49% year-over-year. This resulted in core margins expanding 110 basis points to 4.8%, reflective of our improved mix. EMS for the year, core margins were also up strong, coming in at 3.7%, 100 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $13.9 billion. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet, net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $202 million and for the full fiscal year came in better than expected at $793 million or 2.7% of net revenue. We sometimes hear from investors seeking clarification on our net CapEx, so I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the components. As a reminder, our customers sometimes co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then subsequently reimbursed to us by customers. The line item acquisition of property, plant and equipment on our statement of cash flows includes the full upfront payment made by us. The reimbursements by our customers are reflected as a sale of assets in the line item proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant and equipment on our statement of cash flows. The net of these two items reflects our true spend and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. In Q4, inventory days came in higher than expected at 71 days, an increase of 3 days sequentially, driven by the previously mentioned incremental tightness in the supply chain. While these higher inventory days may continue in the short term, we expect it to normalize below 60% over the mid- to longer term. The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment. In spite of this, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $762 million. As a result of the strong fourth quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $640 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4x and cash balances of $1.6 billion. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY \u201821 to 8.8 million shares or $477 million. This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY \u201813 to approximately 90 million shares at an average price under $27 a bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $3 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. In summary, I am extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal \u201821. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight Jabil's unique position across multiple end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends and the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives. We believe these trends will continue to drive sustainable growth and margins across the enterprise in FY \u201822 and beyond. In healthcare today on the next slide, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare and emerging markets and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently, we're witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We continue to be in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. Our strategic collaboration, which we have highlighted in previous years has enhanced our credibility within the industry and has further enabled Jabil to benefit from this outsourcing trend. On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity, digitization and personalized care across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products which help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare, another end market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies as the automotive market. Climate change, fuel efficiency and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result, OEMs are making substantial investments into electrification efforts. The bulk of our automotive business is focused on electrification of cars, which we believe still has plenty of room to grow. Over the next 3 years, we expect the fastest-growing area of our auto business will be in what's known as ACE: autonomous, connectivity and electrification. Today, electric vehicles account for a small fraction of total vehicles in the market, but the ED segment overall is growing rapidly and gaining a larger share of the total vehicle market. Jabil's longstanding capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space have positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend. We are also extremely well positioned to build the infrastructure that will power tomorrow, be it cloud, semi cap, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices, all power generation and energy storage. 5G is expected to transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with the devices, which will be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This, coupled with the value proposition, Jabil offers cloud hyperscalers is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last 3 years. In power generation and energy storage, we offer differentiated solutions across the entire energy value chain from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings. In this space, we serve a diversified set of customers across numerous markets, including oil and gas, wind, power inverters and converters, smart meters, smart grid communications, building automation, home automation and energy storage. As the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives accelerates, demand for semiconductors has increased exponentially, which has generated a huge backlog in this industry. Jabil is well-positioned to help customers in the semi-cap space with end solutions spanning the front end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back end with validation and test solutions. So what do all these trends translate to in terms of Jabil? You can see our revenue growth expectations by end market in the coming fiscal year. In FY \u201822, in spite of supply chain headwinds, we expect incredibly strong growth in automotive and continued solid growth in healthcare and packaging, industrial, semi cap, 5G wireless and cloud. Today, both segments are in great shape. We've repositioned our business to serve critical and long life cycle products while also providing the foundation for predictable yet strong cash flows and margins. For FY \u201822, we expect both gross profit margins and core operating margins to improve 30 basis points over the prior year, mainly driven by our end market growth and improved mix of business. We also expect the investments to be made in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins. We expect these gains will be slightly offset by continued tightness in the supply chain, especially in the first half of our fiscal year. However, we are incredibly confident in our team's ability to successfully execute in this market given our track record over the last several years. Key to executing amidst an incredibly dynamic environment is our expertise and the investments we made in our IT and supply chain. We've got the tools and technologies that allow us to progressively manage with analytics and data, some of the most complex supply chains in the world. This has certainly been evident over the last 2 years. Let's hear from our supply chain leaders and how they're executing for our customers. [Video Presentation] I would like to take a moment to thank the entire supply chain team from the leaders we just heard from to our teams in our factories who have helped our customers navigate through some very complex supply chains. Turning now to our CapEx guidance for FY \u201822, net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $830 million or 2.6% of net revenue. This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth. Let's talk about our maintenance CapEx for a moment. We now have 100 sites in more than 30 countries. At this scale, our factories require approximately $500 million in annual maintenance investments. Areas of investment are inclusive of IT and data analytics, automation and factory digitization, which will drive innovation across our footprint. This, along with upgrading of our equipment sets based on appropriate cost benefit analysis will improve first pass yields and help reduce ongoing maintenance costs. We are also investing in strategic growth in targeted areas of our business that are expected to deliver strong margin expansion and free cash flow. The bulk of our strategic growth CapEx will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, power generation and energy storage, semi-cap and eco-friendly packaging end markets. All of this positions us well to deliver higher margins as highlighted earlier in my margin waterfall slide. Our improved profitability, strong operational performance and disciplined investments have yielded significant cash flows over the last few years which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business. Moving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows in spite of higher working capital associated with our robust growth in targeted areas I highlighted earlier. This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team's disciplined approach and ability to execute. In FY \u201822, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of $700 million. As I mentioned earlier, we've intentionally targeted higher return areas. In doing so, we're focused on end markets that offer higher profitability and good cash flow dynamics. This discipline has translated to much higher returns on invested capital. Moving forward, we will continue to prioritize investments in areas of our business with higher margins, which we expect will translate into strong returns. Another key aspect of delivering higher returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized. Over the last few years, our team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered and at very attractive interest rates. We ended FY \u201821 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe bodes ample flexibility. And importantly, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Turning now to our capital allocation framework, in fiscal \u201822 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, I thought it would be appropriate to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level, how we plan to deploy our capital over the next 2 years. As a reminder, in July earlier this year, we announced a $1 billion buyback authorization from our Board of Directors over the next 2 years. Our capital return framework beyond organic investments will continue to prioritize the commitment to our dividend, share repurchases and a combination of targeted M&A and capital structure optimization. Moving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital. Turning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide, DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 10% on a year-over-year basis to $4.7 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.6 billion, consistent with the prior year. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal \u201822 to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $365 million to $425 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $321 million to $381 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.90. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.61. The tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately 25%. As we transition to my final slide, you can really begin to see the earnings power of a diversified and balanced Jabil. Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities. All of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.5% in core margins in FY \u201822 along with $6.35 in core EPS and $700 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. I'd like to thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. There is an element of supply chain constraints and the impact on inventory that's included in that $700 million. I think you've got a \u2013 you've got to look at it from a growth perspective as well. We're growing revenue by $2.2 billion over \u201821 to \u201822. That comes with associated working capital as well. So for us to go from 640 to 700 in spite of us growing revenues by $2.2 billion or [8%] (ph) it's pretty healthy. And I think the management team is fully fully focused on free cash flow. So I feel good. We're looking at working capital. We're looking at CapEx. So it will be $700 million, can it go higher if things loosen their grip a little bit on the supply chain constraints? Absolutely. But at this stage, $700 million is a pretty strong free cash flow number, I think. And Steve, if I could just add a little bit on the mobility piece. We've been pushing for diversification as a company. We've been pushing for diversification from a product standpoint, we think we're getting there. We're being extremely disciplined on CapEx and on our free cash flow. So I think the mobility piece, the lack of growth there is something we watch very carefully and it's something we're actually pushing towards. Sure, Ruplu. So, the thing \u2013 we look at it from a different perspective, we look at it from an end market perspective because different end markets have different CapEx requirements. It's not just about existing capacity and forward-looking capacity. I think we have been on a journey. We are continuing on this growth path, the secular trends are very much alive and doing well in Jabil. So, our growth CapEx in that 300-plus range is what will drive our capacity going forward as well. But it's all over the place, Ruplu, is the simplest answer. It's \u2013 I can't put my hand on a particular what this capacity lapped or this will take us to x dollars of revenue. Yes. I think the \u2013 like I said before, I would really feel comfortable with the $700 million free cash flow guidance that we provided for \u201822. I think that discipline in our working capital discipline in our CapEx. All of that continues. Our earnings potential is extremely strong. Our revenue is growing by a couple of billion dollars and that comes with some level of associated working capital. I think over time, as supply chain constraints normalize, I expect the $700 million to go higher if that happens sooner rather than later. So, it's \u2013 I think at this time, it's appropriately sort of de-risked at the $700 million level. It can go higher if supply chain constraints ease earlier. And I think that sort of growth level would be possible beyond \u201822 as well."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Berry: Good morning and welcome to Jabil's third quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with slides, please visit jabil.com with our - within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website. Before handing the call over to Mark, I'd now ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website, beginning with our forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thank you to all of our people here at Jabil. Thanks for the attention you give to our customers and the care you offer one another. At Jabil, it\u2019s people that drive our success, and it's these same people that truly make us who we are. Each day, they carry our culture, and they cement our values. Again, thanks to all. Please turn to slide five. We will now take a look at our Q3 financial results. The quarter came in ahead of expectations, driven by solid execution and a moderate uptick in demand. Said differently, we saw well-balanced contributions across the company. Altogether, the team delivered core operating income of $277 million on revenue of $7.2 billion, creating a core operating margin of 3.8% for the quarter. For sure, I'm pleased with these results. Although what's most interesting to me is the current construct of the business and the improvements we've made to our balance sheet. This powerful combination has us feeling confident as we look towards fiscal '22. As customary, Mike will provide more detail around the quarter and speak to our forward guidance during his prepared remarks. Moving to slide six, you'll see a pie chart, a colorful chart that represents our commercial portfolio and underscores the effectiveness of our team. Today, our business is diversified, and it's diversified at scale, providing more resiliency than ever before. And in my opinion, it offers Jabil a real competitive advantage, especially when we consider our performance and the sustainability of the business. Furthermore, each individual piece of the pie harbors specific domain expertise and deep technical knowledge, all of which make up our library of essential and valuable capabilities. Add to this, the method in which our team weaves together these capabilities, it elevates the way in which we serve our customers, particularly when we move with speed and precision. This approach is enabled by our structure and open collaboration across the enterprise. And when it's done correctly, it yields a proven formula that allows us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands. With that, let's turn to slide seven, where you'll see management's outlook for the year. And looking at this slide, you can see the earnings power of the company and imagine our potential as we look to FY '22 and beyond. For this year, we now anticipate core earnings per share to be in the range of $5.50 on revenue of $29.5 billion. But most importantly, we're maintaining our outlook of 4.2% for core operating margin and increasing our outlook for free cash flow by 5% to $630 million. For me, a positive testament on how the team is managing the business. In wrapping up our forecast for FY '21, I'd like to note, when we communicate inside the company, our strategy is understood, and our path is clear. During these internal discussions, the thing that stands out to me is our team's obsession with how we produce outcomes. And when we think about the how, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive work environment and giving back to our communities. I'm proud that our team's dialed in on all of these areas. In fact, their conduct is exceptional. Consistent with the past few years, we're looking forward to hosting our Annual Investor briefing. This year, the briefing will be held on the morning of September 29. We'll open the session by reporting our fourth quarter and full year results. We'll then follow with a complete review of our priorities, and we'll connect the dots on how these priorities will guide us throughout fiscal '22. Add to this a discussion on end markets and our observations specific to the macro environment. Our management team will also share how we plan to expand core operating margin year-on-year. In addition, we'll also describe the hard work put forth that reinforces our goal to deliver double-digit growth in core earnings per share and free cash flow for fiscal '22. In wrapping up the September session, Mike will break down the shape of the year and share our capital return framework for the coming one to two years ahead. We have lots to share, and we have a good story to tell. As we transition to my final slide, I'll once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets. A few examples of these markets are areas of 5G infrastructure, electric vehicles, personalized health care, cloud computing, clean energy and eco-friendly packaging. I really like the decisions we're making, and we're doing so, while ensuring each employee can be their true self, while respecting the environment in which we work. In closing, we've made tremendous progress, financially, operationally and commercially. At Jabil, we solve problems over and over again. It's why we welcome the continued challenges put forth by our customers. Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. As Mark just highlighted, our third quarter results were very strong driven higher by the combination of continued end market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. In Q3, we saw continued strength with notable revenue upside during the quarter in mobility, cloud, connected devices and semi-cap relative to our plan 90 days ago. Given the additional revenue, I'm particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter, which enabled us to deliver a solid core operating margin of 3.8%, approximately 30 basis points higher than expected. In Q3, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected. The compounding effects of higher revenue and the associated leverage, along with lower interest and tax expense, allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q3. Putting it all together on the next slide. Net revenue for the third quarter was $7.2 billion, approximately $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 14%. GAAP operating income was $240 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.12. Core operating income during the quarter was $277 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 3.8%, 110 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q3 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 18%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.30, a 251% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our third quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.6 billion, an increase of 21% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our connected devices, health care, automotive, and mobility businesses. Core margins for the segment came in at 3.9%, 140 basis points higher than the previous year, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment also came in at $3.6 billion, reflecting strong year-over-year growth in our cloud and semi-cap businesses. Core margins for the segment were 3.8%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting solid execution by the team. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were $585 million in Q3 and capital expenditures net of customer co-investments totaled $197 million. We exited the quarter with cash balances of $1.2 billion. We ended Q3 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our quarter end cash balance, Jabil ended Q3 with access to more than $5 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $130 million. At the end of the quarter $124 million remain outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization. And we intend to complete this authorization during Q4, as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in FY '21 and beyond. Turning now to our fourth quarter guidance. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to $3.95 billion. This is mainly due to strong end market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.65 billion, a decrease of 2% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting our EMS business remains strong and healthy. The modest decrease is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model, offset by higher server volumes in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.9 billion or an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $280 million to $340 million for margin range of approximately 3.8% to 4.3%. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.45. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.20. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, both segments are in incredibly good shape. Last quarter, I highlighted some long-term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets such as health care, automotive, connected devices, 5G, cloud, and semi-cap, all of which continue to show strong performance for the balance of FY '21 and beyond. In tandem with this, in more foundational areas of businesses like print, retail, mobility, networking and storage, we've retooled, re-optimized and re-imagined our longstanding partnerships, with some of the best brands in the world by leveraging Jabil's differentiated capabilities to deliver successful solutions to our customers. The resiliency in our portfolio, coupled with the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses, we believe will continue to drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond. Putting it all together for the year, on the next slide. For FY '21, we expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $29.5 billion. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5.50. And importantly, we now expect to deliver more than $630 million in free cash flow, despite the stronger growth. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver much better than expected results through the first nine months of fiscal 2021. As we enter Q4 and look beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This, coupled with our improved portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses, gives me confidence around continued margin accretion and strong earnings growth in FY '22. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. Seeing this hard work manifest in strong financial results is a testament to the exceptional execution by our teams on all fronts. I want to offer my sincere thanks to our team, for their tremendous commitment and execution during FY '21. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks Mike. As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants, that per our customer agreements, we will not address any customer or product specific questions. We appreciate your understanding. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats on the quarter and on the guide. I have two questions. The first one is on margins. So you talked about margin accretion in fiscal '22. Mark, when I look at fiscal '20 versus fiscal '21, you're having strong margin improvement, 100 basis points to 4.2%. But going forward, should we think that the margin improvement will be more on the DMS, the Diversified Manufacturing Side versus EMS? Because it looks like from your last quarter's guidance, EMS revenues are going from $13.4 billion to $14.1 billion, but the margins are still 3.6%. So just your thoughts on what you can do to improve margins? And what are the areas, what are the leverage factors you have to improve margins going forward?\nMark Mondello: So Ruplu, if I could take the liberty of maybe answering the question directly, but maybe slightly indirectly, right? We - I think one of the interesting things about the way we've shaped the company the last four or five years is, is we have a portfolio where we balance constantly, and the balancing really is about the team. It's led by the likes of Mike Loparco, Steve Borges to Kenny Wilson, the guys running the segments. And then our operational team, our supply chain team, day in and day out, we're balancing between cash flows and margins, and they're not mutually exclusive. So one of the things I said something in my prepared remarks around FY '22, you know, our objective internally and we decided to share it on the call is in terms of margin accretion, we think we'll get margin accretion year-on-year. And then in terms of core EPS off of the $5.50 that we talked about today for '21, our goal is to try to get EPS next year with a six handle on it, which is the double-digit growth. And then as importantly is the cash flows, which we think next year we can get a seven handle on the cash flows. Where does all that come from? I think it comes from things that we continually talk about internally, and we've talked about on the call. It comes with our approach, the solutions we're taking to the marketplace, and then again, Ruplu, the portfolio overall. If we look at our DMS business, very round numbers, right. Our DMS business in fiscal '20, you know, $13 billion, in '22, it will be substantially higher. If we look at our EMS business, $13.5 billion, $14 billion, I don't think the top line will grow as much as DMS. But I think in terms of what that team has done reshaping the business, they've been very, very selective and intentional in terms of where we're making investments. So I would say, it's approach. I would say, it's portfolio. And I don't think we need, you know, we don't need substantial tailwinds to deliver '22. Now if the macro goes sideways on all of us, all bets are off. But I don't think we would have - Mike and I had a long talk the last couple of days, and we just felt it was appropriate to give, again, a little bit of color on kind of where we're up to internally in terms of '22. Quite frankly, when I get together with my direct reports at this point in the year, we spend very little time talking about 4Q. We've got a wonderful team of folks that will, we hope, touchwood, will deliver the year. We're spending all of our efforts on '22. So again, I don't know if that answers your question, but we'll provide a lot more color on that on the September 29th meeting.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details on that. I appreciate the color. Maybe for my last question, Mark, if you can just kind of talk a little bit about the health care and packaging side. How is the J&J business trending? How is the core medical business trending? And any thoughts on packaging, so any color on the growth of that market? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yeah, I'd say we like it all. We continue to make investments in capabilities. If I take that in reverse order, we've had a couple of press releases come out, and we're not big on press releases in terms of - I think companies get over press released. So, we try to be very selective. But on the packaging side, a lot of focus on integration in terms of smart packaging and then a lot of efforts in terms of the environment, what we call eco-friendly packaging, and we're bullish on that. And in terms of health care, we've been banging on the drum on health care for three or four years. And again, I would just say health care overall, whether it'd be on the pharma side, med device, diagnostics, et cetera, is performing above plan. And we've got a pretty interesting path forward for FY '22, Ruplu.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Got it. Thanks again and congrats on the strong execution.\nMark Mondello: I look forward to talking to you on Monday.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Yeah, same here. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteve Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, on the 30 basis points of upside in the quarter, could you break that down a little bit in terms of how much was just pure revenue-driven versus some execution? And what the headwinds might have been in the quarter related to supply chain and COVID? And then secondly, Mark, you mentioned how on the EMS side, you're re-imagining some OEM relationships in the last couple of years. Can you just give us a couple of examples of what that exactly means and how it's driving growth? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: I like your term re-imagining. I'll come back to that in a minute. For the quarter, it was just - I forget the words I used in my prepared remarks, but it was modest top line strength, it cut across I think the upside for Q3 was just under $300 million versus guide. If I had to think through the areas where we saw that, this is an overused term, an overly generic term. But when it's the truth, it was really across lots of our different sectors. If I had to pick a couple, network and storage was stronger than we expected, connected device, I think, was a bit stronger than we expected, cloud, a bit in mobility, but it was a broad scatter [gram] (ph). And in terms of the 30 bps upside on margin, again, I just think it's an indication how we're running the business. We got a little bit of a leverage on the $300 million, and then it was really good execution by the team. And touchwood, I think the good execution continues. In terms of the re-imagining, I don't know if I said that or Mike said that, but I think it's an interesting way to think about it. It's - I think we start with Steve, I think it's huge around obsession around our customers. And it's about starting every conversation about what's best for the customers is not necessarily what's best for Jabil, but then we've got to do a lot of processing to be sure that what's best for the customer aligns with our path forward for the next couple of years. Again, if you think about - you've been connected with us a long time. We've been on this three, four year path of really good intentional growth with a long-term eye on margins and cash flows, because the margins and cash flows going forward are going to give us a decent amount of optionality, a decent amount of levers to turn for shareholders. The team has done a nice job. If you look at where our revenue was back in '17, and you look at where it's going in '22, I think the top line of the company has grown or will grow like close to 50%. And it's not growth for the sake of growth, because what's coming along with that is, again, potentially in '22, a seven handle on cash flows and a six handle on core EPS. Again, those are goals, those are objectives, but that's where we're spending all of our time. In terms of the re-imagining part, looping back to that, Steve, we ask ourselves all the time. Are we or are we not providing great value for every single customer in every single subset of customers? And if we're not providing the best value and they can go find that value at a different price somewhere else, we kind of encourage that, because I think when we're doing our job, when we're providing good value, everything kind of works, the tension in the system comes out, so we've been spending a lot of time on that. And then, I think, somewhere in your question, I think, for the quarters, but maybe I'd talk about it, Steve, for Q3 and Q4, we're still seeing some supply chain headwinds. But as I said in the March call, and I said on - I was doing something with Paul [ph] with JPMorgan, we just have the best supply chain team. And I don't say those things often, although I love our team. I just think we've got - I think we have the best supply chain team in the industry. Our approach to demand planning, and the analytics we use, the fact that our supply chain team is tightly linked to their commercial folks and then the trust and long-term relationships we have with suppliers, and that spans across things, whether it's semis, PCBs, interconnects, passives. And then, we - I think, we've done a very good job in terms of bulk purchases, locking in pricing on raw commodities. So, yes, there is headwinds. I think I said in the March call, Steve, that we thought the supply chain headwinds would probably be with us through the early part of '22, as we sit today, I think that's true for about half of the challenges, and the other half of the challenges may actually creep into the summer of '22. But I think a large catalyst to that is going to be, does demand hold or not across all the different end markets.\nSteve Fox: Great. That's super helpful. Congrats on the quarter.\nMark Mondello: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Adam Tindle from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nAdam Tindle: All right, thanks. Good morning. Mark, I just want to start from a high level, you're wrapping up another strong year here. And if I look back over the past five years or so, it's been kind of two different eras. Prior to this, it's been a heavy focus - it was a heavy focus on diversification, adding revenue, while operating margin was kind of flattish hovering in the mid threes and CapEx was a little bit heavier. This recent era has focused on digesting and optimizing margin and cash flow. What inning are we in on that second journey for margin and cash flow? It sounds like you're expecting it to continue into 2022, I'm thinking beyond that. And how do you think about the right timing to perhaps step on the gas [ph] with CapEx for an outsized growth era again?\nMark Mondello: Yeah. I'm pausing, because I'm thinking. I think it's a great question. I think - I don't want to be dismissive of your question at all. I think that you can hold us accountable to offer some of those details in September. But I don't want to duck the question altogether. I think what inning are we in? I don't separate the - or bifurcate the journey. I think it's all - I think it's a holistic journey. So I look at it and say, you know, this strategy, this whole path started in around fiscal '16, something like that. Where we're at today and heading into fiscal '22, I don't know. To use an American phrase, I guess, maybe seventh inning, something like that. But I wouldn't want to take that it's over. Like, if we do our job right with the margins - by the way, we're still going to press on growth. I think sheer numbers and math on that, Adam, is I said on the JPMorgan thing, I said I can envision us being a $40 billion company at some point. So that would suggest continued growth. But with the sheer math, I think the top line growth starts to attenuate a little bit, although still grow. If we can control our overhead costs, continue to get leverage on the factory network, scale matters for sure, we continue to be really selective in the customers we serve. And I go back to something I said in Steve's comment, every single dollar of revenue we bring in, if we stress test that around, are we or are we not providing great value for the customer? Again, it takes some of the friction out in the relationships. I don't know. I would think that in '22, we'll see margins greater than '21, and I would think in '23 we'll see margins greater than '22. And the one thing about our business is, especially if top line growth, let's say, hypothetically, and this is a complete hypothetical. But let's just say top line growth for the next five years normalizes at 4%, 5%, 6%. And I don't know what that's going to be. I think '22 will be greater than that. But let's just say longer term, you know, this machine now, with this portfolio, the cash flows look awfully good in the modeling that store and I sit around and play with. So, I don't know where we're at. But it's been a lot of hard work and pretty excited about the next couple of years, Adam.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. I wanted to follow up on that cash flow question for Mike. Mike, Mark mentioned the composition of balance sheet in his remarks is a key positive. Net leverage is tracking the multi-year lows as EBITDA continues to build. And I think Mark mentioned perhaps a seven handle on cash flow next year. So, maybe just talk about how you think about optimal capital structure and timing and priorities for deployment of capital to create shareholder value. Why not just return all that 700 plus next year?\nMike Dastoor: So Adam, that's a great question. I think we'll provide a lot more color in September around our capital allocation. I think it will be a balanced capital allocation methodology as we've done in the past. We're committed to returning to shareholders. And I absolutely think it's on the cards to look at that seven handle and see how much we can return to shareholders. Having said that, the discipline we're seeing in our working capital, the discipline we're seeing in our CapEx spend, et cetera, just gives me a lot of comfort that there's a lot of optionality, I think, was the word Mark used going forward in terms of what we can do with our free cash flow. And returning to shareholders will be, in my opinion, will be number one, for sure.\nAdam Tindle: Understood. Congrats on the results.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is now live.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And I just got to say, wow, congratulations on the results and the recovery of your teams through COVID. Looking ahead, both for the next quarter and maybe further out, how should we think about seasonality of your reporting segments? I know we've been a long time since it's been normal. But how should we think about seasonality and maybe strip out the layer of the consignment?\nMark Mondello: So it sounds like there is two questions there, Jim, and thanks for the kind comments. Seasonality and consignment. For sure us transitioning to consignment in some of our business distorts the seasonality because it has an impact on top line, which is just fine, by the way, because our \u2013 again, our focus is on bottom line margin and cash flow. In terms of seasonality, externally, so if I try to net out the impact of consignment, I think that as long as the portfolio exists the way it exists today, so things like automotive and transport and health care and packaging and mobility and connected devices and then the digital print, retail, industrial, semi-cap, wireless, et cetera, network storage, I would say that as the company grows depending on where that growth comes from, and again, I think we're doing - I think the team is doing an exceptional job of what they're saying yes to and what they're saying no to. I would guess as we go from, say, a $30 billion company to maybe a $34 billion, $36 billion company, what you think of as historical seasonality going back to say, the shape of the year in fiscal '17 or '18, that probably flattens a bit. So I think the seasonality, I think there will be some of that there. But if you went from peak to trough, it probably narrows. I think that's happening a bit this year. So - but with that said, I think this fiscal year, if you take the mid point of our guide we just presented for Q4, I think the op income we just provided mid point was 3.10 [ph] Q1 was around 3.65 [ph] Q2, 2.85 [ph] So Q3 was a soft quarter. And I think that aligns a little bit with historical, although going forward, again, I think the shape of the year really starts to flatten, and quarter-to-quarter, I think demand narrows.\nJim Suva: Great. Thank you so much for the additional details.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is now live.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. My first question is with regard to 5G and cloud, can you just provide some more details? Does it seem like, especially from cloud, ignoring consignment, that this is people buying to, sort of, I don't know, pre-buy for capacity needs in the future or fulfill what's the hole that they have right now? I'm just, kind of, curious about how you see this trend? And if you think there's any pull-through from fiscal 2022?\nMark Mondello: I don't know that there's pull-through for \u2013 so by the way, thanks for the question, Shannon. I don't know that there's pull-through for '22. I think hyperscalers, I think cloud and I think 5G wireless, I think all of that has good runway. So, I'm not overly concerned about demand evaporating as long as, again, we go back to - we're providing a great service with great quality to the customers. I see the - although they're different, they're the same, I see both the cloud markets as part of now a robust ecosystem that the world is heavily relying [ph] on. And I see 5G much the same, although a bit different. So, if we were to take a look at - and don't hold me to these numbers, Shannon, but 5G wireless cloud for us as we exited last year was a little over $5 billion. And I think as we go into '22, you know, we'll see a reasonable uptick to that. Again, I just think it's a great fit to our portfolio. I think the solutions and the technologies that we're providing, both on the design side and the process side and the configuration and distribution side, they just fit that marketplace today. So, that's my thinking on the 5G cloud wireless stuff.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thanks. And then I was just wondering in theory we're coming out of COVID and things are opening up at least in some geographies, how have the conversations with customers sort of changed? And I'm wondering, is it - are people focused on on-shoring, diversity of supply chain, looking more to outsource? Or I don't know, how have things changed maybe when you discuss potential new business versus conversations you would have had in 2019? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: I want to make a comment that I'm not sure is linked to your question, so bear with me. And I just think that maybe a bit unrelated to COVID, but maybe related to COVID, I'm really not sure. But I do believe I'm sure in my next comment, which is when you get to be our scale, and you think about the OpEx we spend in IT, and I think about the OpEx we spend in terms of automation and data analytics and artificial intelligence and machine-learning and all the things that are going off every day in our ecosystem. I think we, for sure, have the most efficient IT system of any manufacturing services provider out there because I don't think anybody else has the holistic connection that we have of their IT systems factory-to-factory and then linked in with supply chain and ops, by the way, huge, huge advantage. But I think about the expertise, I think about the experience, I think about our lessons learned, mistakes we've made. And then I think about the global reach or people and everything else, I think because of that, there is just less and less people in the world that want to take on the task of building stuff. Customers still want it for sure, and they're expert in this, by the way. Our customers are expert in branding, marketing, and they're expert in product design. But there's just less interest. The capital intensity of the business, sometimes people look and go, geez, you guys run a business at 4% to 5% operating margin with huge barrier to entry. I think in some weird way, I think building stuff is a secular trend at scale because again, the barrier to entry is way, way high. And it's just really, really hard, but it's what we do, and we do it well. So I think that's a general comment. I'm not sure it has much to do with COVID, although maybe COVID has slowed people down a little bit to think and figure out are they doing the right things for their businesses strategically versus tactically. So maybe there's a little bit of a catalyst there, Shannon. In terms of on-shoring, off-shoring, China, yes, China no, Asia yes, Latin America yes, Mexico, US, Northern Europe, Western Europe, Southern Europe, et cetera. I still end up being a big believer that the capital markets are always, over the long term, going to decide where stuff gets built, where the supply chains get designed. And again, there's pockets of friction, whether it be geopolitical or whatever. But however which way that goes, I'll come back to boy, does scale matter. And when you take a hard look at our footprint, our expertise and where that exists around the globe, I think we're in really, really good shape, regardless to how that plays out.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you very much.\nMark Mondello: Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. \nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning. And thanks for taking the questions and let me add my congratulations to the good results and outlook that the company reported today. I was hoping to talk a little bit more on health care. And the company has built a very good set of capabilities, I think, not just in traditional medical products, but also some things that sit directly with consumers to help with consumer health and wellness. And given everything in the world and some countries still going through, but has gone through over the last year with COVID, I'm interested in what sort of trends Jabil has seen when you talk with your customers and potential strength of the intermediate to longer term around some of those products targeting things like wearables, consumer health and wellness, patient monitoring, those sorts of areas? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Well, I think you answered part of your question, Mark. By the way, thanks for the nice comment at the opening. I think Steve and his team, they're the experts. But if we just step back, the reason we're bullish in that area is a lot of what you alluded to. It's a long-term industry that has historically been heavily around kind of pharma, big eye on diagnostics, med device. And in some ways, there's been such amazing focus on the patient that maybe there's been a little bit of a fall behind in some of the technology, whether that be connecting to 5G or whatever it might be, Mark. As we look at it the next couple of years, I think one thing COVID did is it reshaped activity at hospitals around the world. Elective surgeries were kind of put on the shelf. I think as vaccines take hold, there's a pent-up demand for elective surgeries. So, I think that will be goodness for that whole industry for a period of time. And then maybe at a more strategic long-term deal, for sure, personalized medicine, telehealth, prevention in terms of physiological, biological makeup, DNA chains and then monitoring, you know, aging population and on-body monitoring, you know, that started years ago. But the output from the monitoring was poor, unreliable. I think that's gotten substantially better. We're playing in the middle of that, not just with health care customers, but others that want to make a real difference in that space. So I think those are some of the catalysts why we've got a pretty bullish outlook on health care. And then I think the other part that's beneficial for Jabil is, I think the trajectory where Steve Borges and our team are taking health care, whether it be on med, pharma, diagnostics, on-body, off-body, personalized health, they're able to look around the company and say, wow, and I ironically said some of this in my prepared remarks. Steve and his team can weave together lots of interesting capabilities, whether he borrow some capabilities for Mike Loparco's group or Kenny Wilson's group, both on tooling, both on mechanics, both on how to connect to 5G wireless, industrial design, et cetera. So A, we like where the market is going, and B, I think as the term I used in my prepared remarks, I think our library of collective capabilities is going to serve us well as we take solutions to the marketplace.\nMark Delaney: That's very helpful. Thanks. My second question was on how the tight component and supply chain environment may be impacting some of your customers. And there's been a lot of discussion across various end markets of many big companies unable to get all of the supply that they would like. I'm curious how you think that may be impacting some of the orders and inventory strategy from some of your customers? And how you're trying to plan for that in terms of your operations, financial planning and potentially factor that into some of the comments you gave about what fiscal year may look like? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. We - I don't know, take these as very round numbers. We haircut our Q3 outlook, you know, unconstrained in Q3, just rough numbers was probably $7.1 billion. We cut it to a mid point of 6.9 because of concerns around supply chain components, silicon, passes the whole deal. And we ended up delivering 7.2, which I think is just stellar recognition the job our team has done managing the supply chain. By the way, again, day in, day out, not without challenges. So the challenges are real, and I mentioned it earlier on the call. We \u2013 unconstrained, would 4Q be a little bit higher? Probably. Have we haircut it a little bit? Yes. But we got a lot of confidence in our supply chain folks, and we'll see what happens. So I don't want to make a kind of peanut butter vanilla statement on supply chain because truthfully, Mark, there's so many variables that go into it, everything from which end market, what's the construct of the technology, which part of the supply chain are people leveraging, what kind of relationships are there, how quickly and how agile are the design teams to maybe alter some designs, et cetera, et cetera. So it's everything across the board that we're dealing with. The one nice thing about Jabil is because we build a little bit of everything, and we have so many good relationships both on the customer side and the supply side, we have a very good vantage point, we believe, in being able to triangulate what's really going on. And again, I think that allows us to help our customers and again, gives us a bit of a competitive advantage. But as I said before, I don't think we come out of this choppiness of supply chain until the spring or summer of '22. What you can be rest assured is, is as we did on this call for 4Q and as we'll do for September, we'll take all that into consideration and try to handicap that appropriately before we give any forward looking numbers.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Chung: Hi. This is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on the outsourcing versus insourcing, which industries are you kind of seeing a greater priority to outsource? And are those higher margin opportunities as well in terms of the industry? And then what are the kind of margin dynamics when you're working with existing customers that accelerate this move from in-sourcing to outsourcing? Do you see some operating leverage benefits there on that shift as well? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: Okay. I guess, my first answer will be pretty short, which is a great question. It's just the insource to outsource, it's all over the map. It's not - as we sit today, I mean, there are certain industries that are fully outsourced, and we're all aware of what those are. I really do believe, though, that in boardrooms, talking to my counterparts at lots of our customers, again, there's just - there's not a lot of interest in people wanting to build their own stuff because it is capital intensive, it is hard. If you don't have the OpEx and the reinvestments, constantly, you fall behind. And - but I don't - I wouldn't point to any specific end market or sector at this point in time. It's kind of all over the map. And in terms of is it margin rich or not margin rich, that's all speculative on a relative basis. I can tell you for Jabil, again, we'll deliver, again, on a relative basis fairly modest margins, but very good margins for us. At - looking to deliver this year at 4.2%, we're looking to accrete margins and have them be higher in fiscal '22. But in combination with that, Paul, is the importance of the cash flows as well. So I'll say something, like I said earlier, we are spending a lot of time with the very first question being, if we're going to add a single dollar of revenue to our top line, are we or are we not providing great value to that customer? And if we can get by that yes or no question, then it becomes, can we make it work for Jabil, either on the cash flow side or the margin side. And then we try to keep that well balanced going forward. And I would suggest that even though FY '20 was a COVID year, team did a nice job navigating COVID in '20, and I think the team is doing a nice job this year. And if we continue to work hard and do what we think we can do, I think it's setting up for a nice FY \u2018'22.\nPaul Chung: Got you. Thanks for that. And then can you talk about the $250 billion tech bill passed by the Senate recently? Do you expect the firm to kind of participate and here in what magnitude or kind of too early to tell?\nMark Mondello: You said $250 billion, right?\nPaul Chung: Yeah.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. Okay. I didn't - you broke up a bit. I want to be sure we're talking about the same bill. It's too early to tell. We have great relationships around the D.C. area in terms of understanding it. It's just too early to tell. So TBB I can tell you that I think we'll benefit from that indirectly, whether we were to - there's nothing in our forward looking numbers that anticipates us participating in that directly, but we'll see. But again, we're staying well-informed on that because it has the potential to be an important bill for us.\nPaul Chung: Yeah. Okay. Great. Great quarter. Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Mark, your early outlook for 2022 implies the DMS segment growing faster than EMS. Do you see that coming from all of four key sub-segments as you've seen this year? Or is that from one any particular market? And if you are seeing that broad based strength is that just from underlying demand or are you also seeing share gains or new program wins there?\nMark Mondello: So your observation on the math is correct. And I know this isn't very satisfying, but it is really kind of across the board. I'd like to be able to point to something, but let's just say on a collective basis, Matt, I think it's a combination of change in technologies, as an example, a higher percentage of vehicles moving more towards electric content, electrification or EV altogether. That's just a broad example. So it's technology. I think it's human behavior in terms of - we just - when Delaney was asking earlier around health care, we talked about personalized medicine, connected health, on-body monitoring. But that doesn't mean that market's getting bigger. It means that the activities in the market are shifting, and some of those activities work well in our favor. So I think it's a technology shift. I think it's lifestyle shift. For sure, some of it's market share gains. And then for sure, some of it is just kind of continued global GDP growth and things like that. So it's a combination of all of the above. And I don't really have a specific sector in DMS I'd point to.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And question for Mike regarding the inventory situation. Inventory was up sequentially in dollars and also on a days basis, which makes sense, given the strong seasonal guide for Q4. But should we expect you to be at that somewhat elevated levels for a while now? And are customers compensated you in any way such as in the form of deposits or anything else?\nMike Dastoor: Yes. So, Matt, I think the inventory balance you see at the end of Q3 was largely timing. All that disappears or reverts back in Q4. I expect inventory levels by the end of Q4 to be around the 60 day number and in the longer term, mid-50s, for sure, that's what we're working towards.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you for joining our call today, everyone. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to me. Thank you. This concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thank you to all of our people here at Jabil. Thanks for the attention you give to our customers and the care you offer one another. At Jabil, it's people that drive our success, and it's these same people that truly make us who we are. Each day, they carry our culture, and they cement our values. Again, thanks to all. Please turn to slide five. We will now take a look at our Q3 financial results. The quarter came in ahead of expectations, driven by solid execution and a moderate uptick in demand. Said differently, we saw well-balanced contributions across the company. Altogether, the team delivered core operating income of $277 million on revenue of $7.2 billion, creating a core operating margin of 3.8% for the quarter. For sure, I'm pleased with these results. Although what's most interesting to me is the current construct of the business and the improvements we've made to our balance sheet. This powerful combination has us feeling confident as we look towards fiscal '22. As customary, Mike will provide more detail around the quarter and speak to our forward guidance during his prepared remarks. Moving to slide six, you'll see a pie chart, a colorful chart that represents our commercial portfolio and underscores the effectiveness of our team. Today, our business is diversified, and it's diversified at scale, providing more resiliency than ever before. And in my opinion, it offers Jabil a real competitive advantage, especially when we consider our performance and the sustainability of the business. Furthermore, each individual piece of the pie harbors specific domain expertise and deep technical knowledge, all of which make up our library of essential and valuable capabilities. Add to this, the method in which our team weaves together these capabilities, it elevates the way in which we serve our customers, particularly when we move with speed and precision. This approach is enabled by our structure and open collaboration across the enterprise. And when it's done correctly, it yields a proven formula that allows us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands. With that, let's turn to slide seven, where you'll see management's outlook for the year. And looking at this slide, you can see the earnings power of the company and imagine our potential as we look to FY '22 and beyond. For this year, we now anticipate core earnings per share to be in the range of $5.50 on revenue of $29.5 billion. But most importantly, we're maintaining our outlook of 4.2% for core operating margin and increasing our outlook for free cash flow by 5% to $630 million. For me, a positive testament on how the team is managing the business. In wrapping up our forecast for FY '21, I'd like to note, when we communicate inside the company, our strategy is understood, and our path is clear. During these internal discussions, the thing that stands out to me is our team's obsession with how we produce outcomes. And when we think about the how, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive work environment and giving back to our communities. I'm proud that our team's dialed in on all of these areas. In fact, their conduct is exceptional. Consistent with the past few years, we're looking forward to hosting our Annual Investor briefing. This year, the briefing will be held on the morning of September 29. We'll open the session by reporting our fourth quarter and full year results. We'll then follow with a complete review of our priorities, and we'll connect the dots on how these priorities will guide us throughout fiscal '22. Add to this a discussion on end markets and our observations specific to the macro environment. Our management team will also share how we plan to expand core operating margin year-on-year. In addition, we'll also describe the hard work put forth that reinforces our goal to deliver double-digit growth in core earnings per share and free cash flow for fiscal '22. In wrapping up the September session, Mike will break down the shape of the year and share our capital return framework for the coming one to two years ahead. We have lots to share, and we have a good story to tell. As we transition to my final slide, I'll once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets. A few examples of these markets are areas of 5G infrastructure, electric vehicles, personalized health care, cloud computing, clean energy and eco-friendly packaging. I really like the decisions we're making, and we're doing so, while ensuring each employee can be their true self, while respecting the environment in which we work. In closing, we've made tremendous progress, financially, operationally and commercially. At Jabil, we solve problems over and over again. It's why we welcome the continued challenges put forth by our customers. Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. So Ruplu, if I could take the liberty of maybe answering the question directly, but maybe slightly indirectly, right? We - I think one of the interesting things about the way we've shaped the company the last four or five years is, is we have a portfolio where we balance constantly, and the balancing really is about the team. It's led by the likes of Mike Loparco, Steve Borges to Kenny Wilson, the guys running the segments. And then our operational team, our supply chain team, day in and day out, we're balancing between cash flows and margins, and they're not mutually exclusive. So one of the things I said something in my prepared remarks around FY '22, you know, our objective internally and we decided to share it on the call is in terms of margin accretion, we think we'll get margin accretion year-on-year. And then in terms of core EPS off of the $5.50 that we talked about today for '21, our goal is to try to get EPS next year with a six handle on it, which is the double-digit growth. And then as importantly is the cash flows, which we think next year we can get a seven handle on the cash flows. Where does all that come from? I think it comes from things that we continually talk about internally, and we've talked about on the call. It comes with our approach, the solutions we're taking to the marketplace, and then again, Ruplu, the portfolio overall. If we look at our DMS business, very round numbers, right. Our DMS business in fiscal '20, you know, $13 billion, in '22, it will be substantially higher. If we look at our EMS business, $13.5 billion, $14 billion, I don't think the top line will grow as much as DMS. But I think in terms of what that team has done reshaping the business, they've been very, very selective and intentional in terms of where we're making investments. So I would say, it's approach. I would say, it's portfolio. And I don't think we need, you know, we don't need substantial tailwinds to deliver '22. Now if the macro goes sideways on all of us, all bets are off. But I don't think we would have - Mike and I had a long talk the last couple of days, and we just felt it was appropriate to give, again, a little bit of color on kind of where we're up to internally in terms of '22. Quite frankly, when I get together with my direct reports at this point in the year, we spend very little time talking about 4Q. We've got a wonderful team of folks that will, we hope, touchwood, will deliver the year. We're spending all of our efforts on '22. So again, I don't know if that answers your question, but we'll provide a lot more color on that on the September 29th meeting. Yeah, I'd say we like it all. We continue to make investments in capabilities. If I take that in reverse order, we've had a couple of press releases come out, and we're not big on press releases in terms of - I think companies get over press released. So, we try to be very selective. But on the packaging side, a lot of focus on integration in terms of smart packaging and then a lot of efforts in terms of the environment, what we call eco-friendly packaging, and we're bullish on that. And in terms of health care, we've been banging on the drum on health care for three or four years. And again, I would just say health care overall, whether it'd be on the pharma side, med device, diagnostics, et cetera, is performing above plan. And we've got a pretty interesting path forward for FY '22, Ruplu. I look forward to talking to you on Monday. All right. I like your term re-imagining. I'll come back to that in a minute. For the quarter, it was just - I forget the words I used in my prepared remarks, but it was modest top line strength, it cut across I think the upside for Q3 was just under $300 million versus guide. If I had to think through the areas where we saw that, this is an overused term, an overly generic term. But when it's the truth, it was really across lots of our different sectors. If I had to pick a couple, network and storage was stronger than we expected, connected device, I think, was a bit stronger than we expected, cloud, a bit in mobility, but it was a broad scatter [gram] (ph). And in terms of the 30 bps upside on margin, again, I just think it's an indication how we're running the business. We got a little bit of a leverage on the $300 million, and then it was really good execution by the team. And touchwood, I think the good execution continues. In terms of the re-imagining, I don't know if I said that or Mike said that, but I think it's an interesting way to think about it. It's - I think we start with Steve, I think it's huge around obsession around our customers. And it's about starting every conversation about what's best for the customers is not necessarily what's best for Jabil, but then we've got to do a lot of processing to be sure that what's best for the customer aligns with our path forward for the next couple of years. Again, if you think about - you've been connected with us a long time. We've been on this three, four year path of really good intentional growth with a long-term eye on margins and cash flows, because the margins and cash flows going forward are going to give us a decent amount of optionality, a decent amount of levers to turn for shareholders. The team has done a nice job. If you look at where our revenue was back in '17, and you look at where it's going in '22, I think the top line of the company has grown or will grow like close to 50%. And it's not growth for the sake of growth, because what's coming along with that is, again, potentially in '22, a seven handle on cash flows and a six handle on core EPS. Again, those are goals, those are objectives, but that's where we're spending all of our time. In terms of the re-imagining part, looping back to that, Steve, we ask ourselves all the time. Are we or are we not providing great value for every single customer in every single subset of customers? And if we're not providing the best value and they can go find that value at a different price somewhere else, we kind of encourage that, because I think when we're doing our job, when we're providing good value, everything kind of works, the tension in the system comes out, so we've been spending a lot of time on that. And then, I think, somewhere in your question, I think, for the quarters, but maybe I'd talk about it, Steve, for Q3 and Q4, we're still seeing some supply chain headwinds. But as I said in the March call, and I said on - I was doing something with Paul [ph] with JPMorgan, we just have the best supply chain team. And I don't say those things often, although I love our team. I just think we've got - I think we have the best supply chain team in the industry. Our approach to demand planning, and the analytics we use, the fact that our supply chain team is tightly linked to their commercial folks and then the trust and long-term relationships we have with suppliers, and that spans across things, whether it's semis, PCBs, interconnects, passives. And then, we - I think, we've done a very good job in terms of bulk purchases, locking in pricing on raw commodities. So, yes, there is headwinds. I think I said in the March call, Steve, that we thought the supply chain headwinds would probably be with us through the early part of '22, as we sit today, I think that's true for about half of the challenges, and the other half of the challenges may actually creep into the summer of '22. But I think a large catalyst to that is going to be, does demand hold or not across all the different end markets. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. I'm pausing, because I'm thinking. I think it's a great question. I think - I don't want to be dismissive of your question at all. I think that you can hold us accountable to offer some of those details in September. But I don't want to duck the question altogether. I think what inning are we in? I don't separate the - or bifurcate the journey. I think it's all - I think it's a holistic journey. So I look at it and say, you know, this strategy, this whole path started in around fiscal '16, something like that. Where we're at today and heading into fiscal '22, I don't know. To use an American phrase, I guess, maybe seventh inning, something like that. But I wouldn't want to take that it's over. Like, if we do our job right with the margins - by the way, we're still going to press on growth. I think sheer numbers and math on that, Adam, is I said on the JPMorgan thing, I said I can envision us being a $40 billion company at some point. So that would suggest continued growth. But with the sheer math, I think the top line growth starts to attenuate a little bit, although still grow. If we can control our overhead costs, continue to get leverage on the factory network, scale matters for sure, we continue to be really selective in the customers we serve. And I go back to something I said in Steve's comment, every single dollar of revenue we bring in, if we stress test that around, are we or are we not providing great value for the customer? Again, it takes some of the friction out in the relationships. I don't know. I would think that in '22, we'll see margins greater than '21, and I would think in '23 we'll see margins greater than '22. And the one thing about our business is, especially if top line growth, let's say, hypothetically, and this is a complete hypothetical. But let's just say top line growth for the next five years normalizes at 4%, 5%, 6%. And I don't know what that's going to be. I think '22 will be greater than that. But let's just say longer term, you know, this machine now, with this portfolio, the cash flows look awfully good in the modeling that store and I sit around and play with. So, I don't know where we're at. But it's been a lot of hard work and pretty excited about the next couple of years, Adam. Thanks, Adam. So it sounds like there is two questions there, Jim, and thanks for the kind comments. Seasonality and consignment. For sure us transitioning to consignment in some of our business distorts the seasonality because it has an impact on top line, which is just fine, by the way, because our \u2013 again, our focus is on bottom line margin and cash flow. In terms of seasonality, externally, so if I try to net out the impact of consignment, I think that as long as the portfolio exists the way it exists today, so things like automotive and transport and health care and packaging and mobility and connected devices and then the digital print, retail, industrial, semi-cap, wireless, et cetera, network storage, I would say that as the company grows depending on where that growth comes from, and again, I think we're doing - I think the team is doing an exceptional job of what they're saying yes to and what they're saying no to. I would guess as we go from, say, a $30 billion company to maybe a $34 billion, $36 billion company, what you think of as historical seasonality going back to say, the shape of the year in fiscal '17 or '18, that probably flattens a bit. So I think the seasonality, I think there will be some of that there. But if you went from peak to trough, it probably narrows. I think that's happening a bit this year. So - but with that said, I think this fiscal year, if you take the mid point of our guide we just presented for Q4, I think the op income we just provided mid point was 3.10 [ph] Q1 was around 3.65 [ph] Q2, 2.85 [ph] So Q3 was a soft quarter. And I think that aligns a little bit with historical, although going forward, again, I think the shape of the year really starts to flatten, and quarter-to-quarter, I think demand narrows. Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I don't know that there's pull-through for \u2013 so by the way, thanks for the question, Shannon. I don't know that there's pull-through for '22. I think hyperscalers, I think cloud and I think 5G wireless, I think all of that has good runway. So, I'm not overly concerned about demand evaporating as long as, again, we go back to - we're providing a great service with great quality to the customers. I see the - although they're different, they're the same, I see both the cloud markets as part of now a robust ecosystem that the world is heavily relying [ph] on. And I see 5G much the same, although a bit different. So, if we were to take a look at - and don't hold me to these numbers, Shannon, but 5G wireless cloud for us as we exited last year was a little over $5 billion. And I think as we go into '22, you know, we'll see a reasonable uptick to that. Again, I just think it's a great fit to our portfolio. I think the solutions and the technologies that we're providing, both on the design side and the process side and the configuration and distribution side, they just fit that marketplace today. So, that's my thinking on the 5G cloud wireless stuff. I want to make a comment that I'm not sure is linked to your question, so bear with me. And I just think that maybe a bit unrelated to COVID, but maybe related to COVID, I'm really not sure. But I do believe I'm sure in my next comment, which is when you get to be our scale, and you think about the OpEx we spend in IT, and I think about the OpEx we spend in terms of automation and data analytics and artificial intelligence and machine-learning and all the things that are going off every day in our ecosystem. I think we, for sure, have the most efficient IT system of any manufacturing services provider out there because I don't think anybody else has the holistic connection that we have of their IT systems factory-to-factory and then linked in with supply chain and ops, by the way, huge, huge advantage. But I think about the expertise, I think about the experience, I think about our lessons learned, mistakes we've made. And then I think about the global reach or people and everything else, I think because of that, there is just less and less people in the world that want to take on the task of building stuff. Customers still want it for sure, and they're expert in this, by the way. Our customers are expert in branding, marketing, and they're expert in product design. But there's just less interest. The capital intensity of the business, sometimes people look and go, geez, you guys run a business at 4% to 5% operating margin with huge barrier to entry. I think in some weird way, I think building stuff is a secular trend at scale because again, the barrier to entry is way, way high. And it's just really, really hard, but it's what we do, and we do it well. So I think that's a general comment. I'm not sure it has much to do with COVID, although maybe COVID has slowed people down a little bit to think and figure out are they doing the right things for their businesses strategically versus tactically. So maybe there's a little bit of a catalyst there, Shannon. In terms of on-shoring, off-shoring, China, yes, China no, Asia yes, Latin America yes, Mexico, US, Northern Europe, Western Europe, Southern Europe, et cetera. I still end up being a big believer that the capital markets are always, over the long term, going to decide where stuff gets built, where the supply chains get designed. And again, there's pockets of friction, whether it be geopolitical or whatever. But however which way that goes, I'll come back to boy, does scale matter. And when you take a hard look at our footprint, our expertise and where that exists around the globe, I think we're in really, really good shape, regardless to how that plays out. Yeah, thanks. Well, I think you answered part of your question, Mark. By the way, thanks for the nice comment at the opening. I think Steve and his team, they're the experts. But if we just step back, the reason we're bullish in that area is a lot of what you alluded to. It's a long-term industry that has historically been heavily around kind of pharma, big eye on diagnostics, med device. And in some ways, there's been such amazing focus on the patient that maybe there's been a little bit of a fall behind in some of the technology, whether that be connecting to 5G or whatever it might be, Mark. As we look at it the next couple of years, I think one thing COVID did is it reshaped activity at hospitals around the world. Elective surgeries were kind of put on the shelf. I think as vaccines take hold, there's a pent-up demand for elective surgeries. So, I think that will be goodness for that whole industry for a period of time. And then maybe at a more strategic long-term deal, for sure, personalized medicine, telehealth, prevention in terms of physiological, biological makeup, DNA chains and then monitoring, you know, aging population and on-body monitoring, you know, that started years ago. But the output from the monitoring was poor, unreliable. I think that's gotten substantially better. We're playing in the middle of that, not just with health care customers, but others that want to make a real difference in that space. So I think those are some of the catalysts why we've got a pretty bullish outlook on health care. And then I think the other part that's beneficial for Jabil is, I think the trajectory where Steve Borges and our team are taking health care, whether it be on med, pharma, diagnostics, on-body, off-body, personalized health, they're able to look around the company and say, wow, and I ironically said some of this in my prepared remarks. Steve and his team can weave together lots of interesting capabilities, whether he borrow some capabilities for Mike Loparco's group or Kenny Wilson's group, both on tooling, both on mechanics, both on how to connect to 5G wireless, industrial design, et cetera. So A, we like where the market is going, and B, I think as the term I used in my prepared remarks, I think our library of collective capabilities is going to serve us well as we take solutions to the marketplace. Yeah. We - I don't know, take these as very round numbers. We haircut our Q3 outlook, you know, unconstrained in Q3, just rough numbers was probably $7.1 billion. We cut it to a mid point of 6.9 because of concerns around supply chain components, silicon, passes the whole deal. And we ended up delivering 7.2, which I think is just stellar recognition the job our team has done managing the supply chain. By the way, again, day in, day out, not without challenges. So the challenges are real, and I mentioned it earlier on the call. We \u2013 unconstrained, would 4Q be a little bit higher? Probably. Have we haircut it a little bit? Yes. But we got a lot of confidence in our supply chain folks, and we'll see what happens. So I don't want to make a kind of peanut butter vanilla statement on supply chain because truthfully, Mark, there's so many variables that go into it, everything from which end market, what's the construct of the technology, which part of the supply chain are people leveraging, what kind of relationships are there, how quickly and how agile are the design teams to maybe alter some designs, et cetera, et cetera. So it's everything across the board that we're dealing with. The one nice thing about Jabil is because we build a little bit of everything, and we have so many good relationships both on the customer side and the supply side, we have a very good vantage point, we believe, in being able to triangulate what's really going on. And again, I think that allows us to help our customers and again, gives us a bit of a competitive advantage. But as I said before, I don't think we come out of this choppiness of supply chain until the spring or summer of '22. What you can be rest assured is, is as we did on this call for 4Q and as we'll do for September, we'll take all that into consideration and try to handicap that appropriately before we give any forward looking numbers. Yeah. Okay. I guess, my first answer will be pretty short, which is a great question. It's just the insource to outsource, it's all over the map. It's not - as we sit today, I mean, there are certain industries that are fully outsourced, and we're all aware of what those are. I really do believe, though, that in boardrooms, talking to my counterparts at lots of our customers, again, there's just - there's not a lot of interest in people wanting to build their own stuff because it is capital intensive, it is hard. If you don't have the OpEx and the reinvestments, constantly, you fall behind. And - but I don't - I wouldn't point to any specific end market or sector at this point in time. It's kind of all over the map. And in terms of is it margin rich or not margin rich, that's all speculative on a relative basis. I can tell you for Jabil, again, we'll deliver, again, on a relative basis fairly modest margins, but very good margins for us. At - looking to deliver this year at 4.2%, we're looking to accrete margins and have them be higher in fiscal '22. But in combination with that, Paul, is the importance of the cash flows as well. So I'll say something, like I said earlier, we are spending a lot of time with the very first question being, if we're going to add a single dollar of revenue to our top line, are we or are we not providing great value to that customer? And if we can get by that yes or no question, then it becomes, can we make it work for Jabil, either on the cash flow side or the margin side. And then we try to keep that well balanced going forward. And I would suggest that even though FY '20 was a COVID year, team did a nice job navigating COVID in '20, and I think the team is doing a nice job this year. And if we continue to work hard and do what we think we can do, I think it's setting up for a nice FY \u2018'22. You said $250 billion, right? Yeah. Okay. I didn't - you broke up a bit. I want to be sure we're talking about the same bill. It's too early to tell. We have great relationships around the D.C. area in terms of understanding it. It's just too early to tell. So TBB I can tell you that I think we'll benefit from that indirectly, whether we were to - there's nothing in our forward looking numbers that anticipates us participating in that directly, but we'll see. But again, we're staying well-informed on that because it has the potential to be an important bill for us. Yeah. Thank you. So your observation on the math is correct. And I know this isn't very satisfying, but it is really kind of across the board. I'd like to be able to point to something, but let's just say on a collective basis, Matt, I think it's a combination of change in technologies, as an example, a higher percentage of vehicles moving more towards electric content, electrification or EV altogether. That's just a broad example. So it's technology. I think it's human behavior in terms of - we just - when Delaney was asking earlier around health care, we talked about personalized medicine, connected health, on-body monitoring. But that doesn't mean that market's getting bigger. It means that the activities in the market are shifting, and some of those activities work well in our favor. So I think it's a technology shift. I think it's lifestyle shift. For sure, some of it's market share gains. And then for sure, some of it is just kind of continued global GDP growth and things like that. So it's a combination of all of the above. And I don't really have a specific sector in DMS I'd point to."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. And good morning, everyone. As Mark just highlighted, our third quarter results were very strong driven higher by the combination of continued end market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. In Q3, we saw continued strength with notable revenue upside during the quarter in mobility, cloud, connected devices and semi-cap relative to our plan 90 days ago. Given the additional revenue, I'm particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter, which enabled us to deliver a solid core operating margin of 3.8%, approximately 30 basis points higher than expected. In Q3, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected. The compounding effects of higher revenue and the associated leverage, along with lower interest and tax expense, allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q3. Putting it all together on the next slide. Net revenue for the third quarter was $7.2 billion, approximately $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 14%. GAAP operating income was $240 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.12. Core operating income during the quarter was $277 million, an increase of 61% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 3.8%, 110 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q3 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 18%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.30, a 251% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our third quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.6 billion, an increase of 21% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our connected devices, health care, automotive, and mobility businesses. Core margins for the segment came in at 3.9%, 140 basis points higher than the previous year, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment also came in at $3.6 billion, reflecting strong year-over-year growth in our cloud and semi-cap businesses. Core margins for the segment were 3.8%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting solid execution by the team. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were $585 million in Q3 and capital expenditures net of customer co-investments totaled $197 million. We exited the quarter with cash balances of $1.2 billion. We ended Q3 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our quarter end cash balance, Jabil ended Q3 with access to more than $5 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $130 million. At the end of the quarter $124 million remain outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization. And we intend to complete this authorization during Q4, as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in FY '21 and beyond. Turning now to our fourth quarter guidance. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to $3.95 billion. This is mainly due to strong end market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.65 billion, a decrease of 2% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting our EMS business remains strong and healthy. The modest decrease is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model, offset by higher server volumes in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.9 billion or an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $280 million to $340 million for margin range of approximately 3.8% to 4.3%. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.45. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1 to $1.20. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, both segments are in incredibly good shape. Last quarter, I highlighted some long-term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets such as health care, automotive, connected devices, 5G, cloud, and semi-cap, all of which continue to show strong performance for the balance of FY '21 and beyond. In tandem with this, in more foundational areas of businesses like print, retail, mobility, networking and storage, we've retooled, re-optimized and re-imagined our longstanding partnerships, with some of the best brands in the world by leveraging Jabil's differentiated capabilities to deliver successful solutions to our customers. The resiliency in our portfolio, coupled with the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses, we believe will continue to drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond. Putting it all together for the year, on the next slide. For FY '21, we expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $29.5 billion. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5.50. And importantly, we now expect to deliver more than $630 million in free cash flow, despite the stronger growth. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver much better than expected results through the first nine months of fiscal 2021. As we enter Q4 and look beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This, coupled with our improved portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses, gives me confidence around continued margin accretion and strong earnings growth in FY '22. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. Seeing this hard work manifest in strong financial results is a testament to the exceptional execution by our teams on all fronts. I want to offer my sincere thanks to our team, for their tremendous commitment and execution during FY '21. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Adam. So Adam, that's a great question. I think we'll provide a lot more color in September around our capital allocation. I think it will be a balanced capital allocation methodology as we've done in the past. We're committed to returning to shareholders. And I absolutely think it's on the cards to look at that seven handle and see how much we can return to shareholders. Having said that, the discipline we're seeing in our working capital, the discipline we're seeing in our CapEx spend, et cetera, just gives me a lot of comfort that there's a lot of optionality, I think, was the word Mark used going forward in terms of what we can do with our free cash flow. And returning to shareholders will be, in my opinion, will be number one, for sure. Thank you. Yes. So, Matt, I think the inventory balance you see at the end of Q3 was largely timing. All that disappears or reverts back in Q4. I expect inventory levels by the end of Q4 to be around the 60 day number and in the longer term, mid-50s, for sure, that's what we're working towards."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor section of our website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website. Before handing the call over to Mark, I'd now ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with our forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year 2021 net revenue, earnings and cash flows. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by offering a warm thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for your commitment and thank you for always making safety your top priority. And stepping back and reflecting for a moment, it's hard to believe that 12 months have passed since we first encountered COVID. I think about sitting alongside Mike and Adam one year ago, here in our March 2020 earnings call, when clarity vanished and uncertainty ran wild. Yet in typical Jabil fashion, our people did what they do; they dove in and gave their very best to combat the pandemic. They did so by looking after one another, while taking outstanding care of our customers. It's a point in time that I'll never forget; it's a point in time that highlights the level of respect and admiration that I have for our team here at Jabil. Their attitude and their actions continue to impress. And for sure, there is no other team I'd rather be part of. Again, much thanks to all of our employees who simply make Jabil, Jabil. Please turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at our 2Q results. Our second quarter came in well ahead of expectations, driven by stronger than expected product demand, solid execution and a well-balanced contribution throughout the entire company. The team delivered core earnings per share of $1.27 on revenue of $6.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%. I'm really pleased with our financial results for the quarter. Although, what's quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements we've made to our balance sheet. All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '21. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY22. As customary, Mike will provide more detail around our second quarter results during his prepared remarks. I'd now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio. Slide 6 underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate. Today, our business is wide-ranging and resilient; this is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption or cyclical demand. Furthermore, our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities, innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers. It's a proven formula that's trusted by many of the world's most remarkable brands. Moving to Slide 7, I'll address our updated outlook for the year. We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of $5 a share, an increase of 25% from what we anticipated back in September with top line revenue coming in around $28.5 billion. This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another 10 basis point increase to core operating margin which we now forecast to be 4.2% for the year. Lastly, we remain committed to generating a minimum of $600 million in free cash flow, a testament to how we're managing our capital investments. As I wrap up the outlook, it's notable that our strategy is working, our path is well understood and how we go about producing results is important. On this last point, when we think about the how, we think about purpose; a purpose that guides us in our journey, a purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors; behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive environment and giving back to our communities around the world. I'm just so proud that our team is hitting the mark in all of these areas. As we transition to my final slide, I want to once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two years to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets; markets that largely align with secular trends. A few examples of these being 5G, personalized healthcare, electric vehicles, digital learning, cloud computing, clean energy and eco-friendly packaging. Our team continues to develop deep domain expertise in concert with these secular tailwinds. I like the decisions we're making and what we're doing, and we do what we do while respecting the environment and safeguarding our workplace. We're committed to a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance. We encourage each and every employee here at Jabil to be their true self. We strive to make the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier, and a little bit safer each and every day. One factor that makes good companies great is possessing a value system which allows them to solve problems over and over again; we embraced this way of thinking and welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark just detailed, our second quarter performance was outstanding driven by the combination of broad-based end-market strength and associated leverage, and improved portfolio mix and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. We saw broad-based revenue strength across the business, most notably in mobility, cloud, healthcare, connected devices, automotive and semi-cap. Given the additional revenue, I am particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter which enabled us deliver a strong core operating margin of 4.2%. And finally, our net interest expense came in better than expected during the quarter, due in large part to better working capital management coupled with the proactive steps we've taken over the past year to optimize our capital structure. Putting it all together on the next slide, net revenue for the second quarter was $6.8 billion, $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by $700 million or 11%. GAAP operating income was $236 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99. Core operating income during the quarter was $285 million, an increase of 78% year-over-year representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q2 was $33 million and core tax rate came in at approximately 23%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 154% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now, turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.6 billion, an increase of 26% on a year-over-year basis. The strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broad-based as several of the end-markets we serve are becoming increasingly critical such as connected devices, healthcare, automotive and mobility. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 5.1%, 210 basis points higher than the previous year, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.2 billion, also reflecting strong broad-based demand. Core margins for the segment were 3.1%, 80 basis points over the prior year. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were $20 million in Q2 and capital expenditures, net of customer co-investments, totaled $152 million. We exited the quarter with cash balance of $838 million. We ended Q2 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q2 with access to more than $4.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $82 million. At the end of the quarter $254 million remained outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization, and we intend to complete this authorization during the second half of FY '21 as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Turning now to our third quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 19% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 billion; this is mainly due to strong end-market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.4 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting our EMS business remained strong and healthy. The modest increase is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '21 to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $7.2 billion or an increase of 9% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $220 million to $270 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.89. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses which we believe will drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond. In healthcare today, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently, we are witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We're in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products that help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare. Another end-market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. Today, electric vehicles account for less than 2% of total vehicles in the market. Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result, OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort. Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend. Turning now to 5G; 5G will transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both, the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years. The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to dust capabilities which incorporates engineering, manufacturing and eco-friendly decommissioning observers [ph], all within collocated facilities. This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times, security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our US domicile hyperscalers. Shifting now to packaging; we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and eco-friendly packaging. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste, demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating. And then finally, within semi-cap, the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs. Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicon today. Jabil serves the semi-cap space with end-to-end solutions, spanning the front-end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back-end with validation and test solutions. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business which has allowed us to deliver much better-than-expected results in the first half of FY '21. As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY '21 estimates for revenue, core operating income, core margins and core earnings per share. We now expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $28.5 billion [ph]. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5. And importantly, despite the stronger growth we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements we will not address any customer or product-specific information. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. You know, I had a couple of questions. Maybe Mark, first question on the EMS side. You're guiding now to $13.4 billion that's almost a billion dollars higher than the previous guidance. But the operating margin is still guided at 3.6%. So just curious, I mean, why isn't the operating margin target for that for this year for EMS moving up a little bit more? Just if you can just talk about the puts and takes on that. Thanks.\nMark Mondello : Thanks, Ruplu. I feel good about where the margin. I think you're right, we look at the overall corporate margin for the year, we think we'll be around 4.2%. And EMS will be in the range of I would guess 3.6%, 3.7%. I look at that relative to fiscal '19. If I go back that far, and I think EMS in '19, was around 3% all in. Last year, we're below that and I acknowledge that was a COVID year with excessive COVID expenses. But I feel pretty good about that business overall. I think we're doing the right things in cloud. I look at that business today in terms of a mix of legacy business, some businesses that we've gotten a bit of a nudge or help with COVID. But most importantly, Ruplu, I think about things that Mike was talking about in his prepared remarks in terms of trends that we think are going to be around for a while. Things like 5G, electric vehicles, cloud computing, clean energy.  So I feel good about the year. We continue to make OpEx investments as well in the EMS segment, but I think we're on a good trajectory. The things I obsess about or worry about. The condition of the EMS business, the next two, three years isn't one of them. \nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And that makes sense. Just on the mobility side, I want to ask a general question. I mean, are you concerned or how concerned are you about any configuration changes that might come up in the rest of the year? Can you may be at a high level, just talk about how prepared Jabil is this year versus in prior years about handling mobility related, you know, volatility that can come up in the rest of the year?\nMark Mondello : I don't want to speculate on any configuration changes or anything like that. Our relationship in that space with our main customer there is super solid. And when I just think back about the last two, three years of execution, I've got again, very little doubt in our ability to execute on the mobility side, configuration changes or not. So again, not an area that then I'm losing a lot of sleep over.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great. Thanks for the details and again, congrats on the quarter end and the strong guide. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning. Mark. I wanted to start with a question on operating margin and acknowledge it's been very strong so far. A two parter [ph] just on near term and long term moving forward. So first on near term, your Q3 guidance implies that total company operating margin is going to be down, maybe somewhere around mid-3% range or so and then back up to around 4% or so in Q4, based on the EPS guide if I got that correct, doesn't look like that's volume related because revenue is going to be flattish during this time. So, maybe just more color on drivers of the Q3 dip and rebound in Q4. And secondly, you mentioned longer term as you exit this year with a four handle. The trajectory that that puts you on as you think about fiscal '22 and beyond, because you said you wanted to build on that? \nMark Mondello : Yes, thanks Adam. Q3 is always a little bit of a debit for us. And, as much as we take a lot of I don't know if the words pride we feel really good about the overall mixing of the business. What we've done in the last two, three years. But again, we always see a little bit of a soft spot in terms of enterprise level, in terms of up margin. I think you're right, enterprise margins for Q3 will be around the 3.5% range. And, again, I compare that to last year, which maybe it's nonsense, because of COVID it's up substantially year-on-year. I'm going off a memory, but I got to believe that if we went back to fiscal '19, we'd be up year-on-year in terms of Q3 to Q3 as well. So none of it has anything to do with reflection of the business other than for certain parts of our business as you know, Q3 tends to be more of an investment quarter on an OpEx line than the other quarters. The thing that I'm focused on more than anything is beginning of the year.  So we've had, we've strung together, I don't know, adding four, five years where the overall enterprise up margin line has been bouncing around 3.5%. That says we've really been focused on adding good quality growth to the company. And in September, we gave an outlook that said for the year we do a four handle on up margin. 90 days ago in December, we took that up to four one now we're taking that up to four two. So I feel, I'm more focused on that trajectory than the quarter-on-quarter results. And in terms of your comments forward looking beyond '21, we'll give more detail around that in the Investor Day in September, I had said something in my prepared remarks today around the fact that we're very focused on continuing a positive direction with margins as we get into fiscal '22. And that would be relative to the four two, that we hope to post this year. \nAdam Tindle: Got it. And maybe just as a follow up for Mike, you talked about being able to plan to generate over $600 million of free cash flow this year, wondering if that's also something that you can build on like Mark's comments on operating margin as we think about a go forward basis, or are there are CapEx investments to achieve that operating margin improvement? And maybe you can just tie in your capital allocation priorities as you answer that question? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor : Thanks, Adam. Yes, definitely free cash flow will, I think we've said more than $600 million for this year, as we continue into FY '22. I expect that to continue to grow. Again, we've said this before CapEx is something where we've been extremely disciplined in that 2.9%, 3% range. So free cash flows next year again, we'll get guidance in September, but I expect that to go up on a similar unraid [ph] as it's done in FY '21. As relates to capital allocation Adam, we continue to be sort of well balanced. We continue with our buybacks. I talked about our buybacks in my prepared remarks, we have to earn $34 million left of our authorization, we intend to complete their authorization in Q3 and Q4 or in the second half of the year. So that shows that we're extremely committed to the buyback program. And that will continue into '22, '23. I don't want to preempt anything now. But I'm sure we'll be continuing that progress from a buyback standpoint. Most of the, I think we laid out a few quarters ago the capital allocation percentages, roughly half buys into buybacks, dividends, some of the balance of that goes into debt restructuring and the balance would be opportunistic, sort of M&A as well. So well balanced. Capital allocation continues going forward.\nAdam Tindle: Very helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Suva: Thank you and good results. If I look at your updated guidance on the buy segments, am I correct that the 5G wireless and cloud is the one that kind of is giving you the most surprise there? And if so, are any of your segments or all of them or any of them experiencing semiconductor shortages? Are you able to procure all the components and items needed? Thank you. \nMark Mondello : Thanks, Jim. I assume you're talking about our eight sectors [ph]. Yes, so, I'm not quite sure we mean, in terms of surprise, in terms of the uplift, for sure. So I don't know that it's a surprise to us that we're seeing strength in 5G and cloud. Back in December, we knew that there was going to be some component shortages and constraints. But we've been very bullish on the 5G wireless infrastructure and cloud area of our business. So whether surprised or not, it's certainly an area where we continue to see strength. And I think that's largely both on the 5G side and the cloud side. Our services and our solutions are being well accepted and embraced out in the marketplace. So feel really good about that area of the business. In terms of supply constraints, I would say that we talked about this a bit in December, let's say, nine months ago, or so. You know, there was demand drops everywhere, based on COVID. I think that people took a lot of their demand signals, cut them abruptly. And then, at least our conversations with our customers, very few people anticipated the rebound that we've seen, which largely started August, September timeframe, and a bit to our surprise is continued to be very strong through early stages of 2021. And on the supply side, again, all of that drove constraints.  One good piece of information, I think to share is any type of supply constraints, whether it be around resin, whether it be around silicon, whether it be around passives, whether it be around mechanicals all that's handicapped into our numbers and I would actually say that we took a fairly deep handicap to that for our Q3 and Q4. So I feel if anything, maybe there's some slight upsides to what we've put out today, assuming that the supply constraints don't work and worse. And the other thing I would say is, I think the procurement team at Jabil just simply the best team in the business. And if I think about our scale, if I think about our holistic approach to demand planning, whether that cuts across healthcare or mobility or EMS business or automotive, our team's knowledge of the marketplace, the knowledge of the commodities, knowledge of technologies, and in the long standing relationships we have is really allowing us to navigate what otherwise is a tough component market at the moment. So I feel we're getting along and getting by quite well, all things considered on a relative basis.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the details.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your question. \nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning. Two questions if I could, please. First Mark, could you just give a little more color on where the healthcare solutions businesses on its margin journey and how it did in the quarter? You know, maybe referencing back to when you first did the J&J [ph] deal, and what you were thinking for next year? And then secondly, I just don't clear based on what you just said about constraints and potential inventory builds, Mike, you're talking about still doing $600 million in cash flow, free cash flow is the difference between prior thinking just basically higher EBIT, offset by more inventory investments or there other puts and takes. Thanks. \nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] Please continue to stand by the presentation will resume momentarily. This is the operator, the presenters have been rejoined, please presume\nMark Mondello : Hey Steve, somehow you cut off.\nSteven Fox: Sorry for breaking the conference call. Did you hear any of my questions? Or should I repeat?\nMark Mondello : If you could repeat them, that'd be great. \nSteven Fox: Yes, sure. So first question, again, was on the health care area. So if you can provide some color into how it performed during the quarter, both top line and margin and where you are on the margin journey, you know, referencing back to when you first did the J&J deal? And then secondly, I'm just trying to understand make sure I understand the that the cash flow target staying at $600 million plus, you have higher EBIT, but it sounds like higher inventory investments. Is that basically the puts and takes versus 90 days ago, or is there anything else? Thanks. \nMark Mondello : Yes, thank you. So on the healthcare side, I think we're -- I think we continue to hit it on all cylinders. Steve Borges [ph] and his team who run that business, we started talking about the JJMD relationship. I don't even know how long ago now to 2.5 years ago, we kind of laid out a roadmap there and our health care team has executed nearly flawlessly to the roadmap that we laid out. So feel good about that and then the business around the JJMD. And I talked in my prepared remarks about different trends. And the team is really focused on things like for health care, like personalized health, like digital health. We announced sometime during the quarter, another relationship that has everything to do with technology around auto injection and auto injectors. And so I just look at the technology, the investments that our healthcare teams are making, and feel really good about that. Our healthcare and packaging business, speed, last year, I think was in the neighborhood of $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion. And I would guess, as we exit this year, health care and packaging, we'll be bumping up against $5 billion. And I think we'll continue to see good solid growth in that area for the next two to three years.  In terms of the $600 million of cash flow it's another number that I feel really good about and on the surface. Maybe it's a little bit confusing, because EBITDA is going up and margins are going up. So why wouldn't cash flow go up? We have been working diligently to continue to shape the portfolio. Our number one focus as our leadership team is cash flows and management over the next two, three, four years. I think if we ever get to a point where as a leadership team, we decide not to grow the company. That would be a perilous thing to do and makes no sense to us as long as we're adding good quality business, again, attached to secular trends that allow us to continue to expand margins, as we look at '22 and '23. So if I take you back to the beginning of the year, we said we do $26.5 billion, $27 billion in revenue. Now we're bumping up against $28 billion, $28.5 billion. And with the additional top line with the way the teams managing working capital, the way the team's managing CapEx, and then Mike alluded to the fact that we were going to complete our buyback authorization by August 31 of the year.  So I think we're being well balanced in terms of both capital investments, OpEx investments and shareholders. I feel good about the $600 million plus. And then we'll give an update to what I think you should anticipate is stronger cash flows as we get into the Investor Day in September. \nSteven Fox: Great, appreciate all that color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Coster of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Coster: Yes, thanks for taking my question. You talked earlier of, a platform for better margins in the future. And they're really improving. And I'm just wondering, Mark, if you can talk about how much of this is structural in the industry itself? And how much of it is under your control? What is that you are doing today that makes you feel sure that you're locking in higher margins in sort of medium term?\nMark Mondello : I don't know that it's structural to our industry. I hope so. I think if our competition can lock in higher margins that's always good but we're pretty inwardly focused, Paul. I think about first and foremost we obsess about customer care and customer solutions. And I think, if we don't get that out of order, Paul, and we continue to obsess about our customers and what they need in solving their issues; the financials will follow. If I step back and I look at this fiscal year, I was noticing something over the weekend, this will be along with the margin trajectory, I think this would be the first year we've ever had in the history of the company, if we execute, and that's a big capital, if but if we execute, we're going to string together four consecutive quarters where every single quarter is at or exceeds $1 per share. And that just kind of jumped off the page. But in terms of margin expansion, you asked about is it structural? I think so. That's our plan and that's what will allow us to take margins up from the 4.2%, as we get into next year.  And I think about everything from our balance sheet, if you take a look at, and again, now I'm coming at it a little bit more from an EPS perspective. But since you asked the question around is it structural. Our balance sheet continues to improve, net debts going down, interest expense is going down. Overall, liquidity has gone up. And then I take a look at the business and I look at things like I think we have very, very good overhead and overhead costs, I think about overall demand, I think about the secular trends that we've talked about, sometimes that's a really, really overused term. But we are truly embedded in so many of those markets, which I think are going to be around for the next two or three years. And then, the whole COVID thing, it's not behind us yet. But with the vaccine being here, we hope to have 70%, 80% of our employees globally have access to the vaccine over the next six to eight months. It's just and then I think lastly, and we've been talking about this for 10 to 12 quarters is the mix of our businesses as healthy as it's ever been.  So I think you shake all that stuff up together. And again, I take a look at the last couple years margins have been around 3.5%. I think that there's a real opportunity here for us to, on a structural basis, increase margins by 100 basis points as we look forward after that 3.5% base.\nPaul Coster: Well, maybe the follow up then Mark is, what is it that you're not doing? Are you able to, it sounds like you had the choice of not doing some business, because you could be satisfying your customers delighting them even but it could be bad business that you're doing ultimately, from a margin perspective. So can you talk to us a little bit about how you shaped the portfolio and what you do at the front end to prevent low margin business coming in and hurting the overall business model?\nMark Mondello : I think it starts with absolute clarity, communication to the troops internally. You know, I can tell you this, I've been with the company a long time. Right screw things up is when I have stuff in my head with the leadership team and we don't communicate it to the group. What I can tell you and the reciprocal of that is when the group understands where we're going and why we're going there and what our purpose is there's no better team, there just isn't. And so people understand that there's two things that we're focused on for the next two, three, four years, and that's continued expansion of cash flows, and continued expansion and margins. And by the way, our portfolio, we kind of refer to as a portfolio for a reason. We have some business that might be a little softer on the margin side, but based on terms based on the business itself have tremendous cash flows. And we have other businesses that have tremendous margin, but maybe the working capital is a little richer, we have some of that in our healthcare, space and other areas. But when you blend all that together, I think there's just a picture here, that we're just starting to paint. And, again, we feel pretty good for the next two to three years.  To answer your question directly. We're just going to stay away from bad business. And you know that that could mean a variety of things. But I think internally people are pretty clear on what we're going to go after. Certainly, if we can go after business where there's going to be positive trends going forward. It's goodness for everybody. But I think I think the organization is pretty clear about the type of businesses we're not going to go after.\nPaul Coster: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a bit more into the 5G Wireless and cloud outlook, the increase? I'm just curious to know specifically, maybe you can give some more details on what's driving that and what I'm trying to figure out is, is this demand that would have come in the future but as being pulled in now as people start to ramp 5G? Or are you seeing market share gains and actually end market growth because obviously, the market is growing? But how much of it has been driven by increased and demand overall? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.\nMark Mondello : Shannon, I'd say and I don't want to be offensive by not getting into details. I would say this with a high degree of confidence. For sure, we're seeing stretch secular trends and trends that are very positive in terms of cloud and finally, what looks to be reasonable plans in terms of the 5G Wireless rollout. So that's going to be helpful. And we think that's here to stay for, not a number of months, but a number of years. And by the way, we think that's going to have all kinds of tangents tied to it as well, once the 5G rollout gets underway in terms of derivatives to other parts of our business. And then I think I complement that with saying, there's just been good acceptance of our solutions and our services in the space, both on the design side, I think Mike alluded to, he was using some fancy terms around, what we call a kind of designed to dust and repurposing older servers. And he did a nice job explaining it, but it sounds a little, I don't know, overly technical or whatever. But when we talk about the design side, all the way to repositioning and disposing of older hardware, kind of front to back, I think, Shannon, the solutions we have in that space. Again, it's still what I would call early days, but had been received quite well. And I would also suggest that there is some market share wins in there as well.\nShannon Cross: Great, that was helpful. And then my second question is just on stimulus, if you think back to last summer, and maybe what you, I know, it's somewhat hard to determine how much benefit you guys saw directly from stimulus, but how are you thinking about it, when you gave us the guidance for this year in terms of the checks that are going to be hitting in the next few weeks? Thank you.\nMark Mondello : Yes, thanks. Let me break up the back half of '21 with '22 and '23. I can't make sense of the US equity markets anymore, because I don't know how they got detached from fundamentals in so many ways. I just think that when you put $4 trillion of stimulus into the system, and there's dollars everywhere, they got to go somewhere. I think that stimulus will be a bit of a driver for the next couple quarters, maybe into 1Q of '22. But the nice thing is, so as we navigate '21, I see two things. I see certain parts of our business being driven by what I would call COVID type behaviors, some of those will dissipate, some of those maintain. I see certain parts of our business that are stimulus-related. In certain parts of the United States right now, you go and you try to buy a truck or car, an appliance, whatever it may be; there is backlogs everywhere, and I think that's stimulus related. But as the impact of stimulus, and the impact of COVID start to attenuate a bit and fall off of it, I think what's right behind that is kind of -- no kidding, no nonsense secular trends. And again, Mike talked about it, I talked about it in our prepared remarks; and I think those specific trends certainly will be a driver for our business the next two, three, four years, so it's not like I'm sitting here going, geez, when stimulus abates [ph], when COVID types of hardware either go away or reduce -- that there is not going to be other elements that continue to give us a little bit of an uplift. So, I don't know if that helps or gets at your question, but that's how I see it.\nShannon Cross: Yes, very helpful. Thank you very much.\nMark Mondello : Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you and good morning. Mark, your commentary across end-markets extremely positive; one area that you're still guiding down year-over-year as networking and storage. Looks like you took that up a little bit from $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion but still down. Could you tell us what you're seeing in that market? Is there still weakness in on-prim spend and expectations of that improving as the recovery continues post-COVID?\nMark Mondello: Yes, sure. So the network storage business was around $2.8 billion in fiscal '20. September, we took that all the way down to $2.2 billion, and again, that's a reflection of a couple of things; it's a reflection of some of the legacy business may be starting to lose footing, and lose a little traction out in the marketplace. Number two is; again as we continue to think about our portfolio for fiscal '22 and '23, there are certain areas of that business that when we think about our overall invested capital, might not make sense for us any longer but the nice thing is, from the September timeframe to December timeframe, to today, we've actually been on a trajectory back up. So that's nothing more than, A) we have tremendous relationships with certain customers in that space; and we'll continue to serve those customers, serve them well; and as long as they'll have us, and appreciate the value we provide, we're all in. And -- so I -- again, I think about $2.8 billion in '20 to down $2.2 billion in the last -- I think December, and today we've taken it back up by $200 million roughly. And I would just look at -- I'd look at network and storage as a -- a very key element of our eight sector makeup. And I would say that even though in some of those businesses, margins might be tight, cash flows are quite good, so it's a very good complement to the other seven sectors.\nMatt Sheeran: Okay, thank you for that. And then just a question regarding your packaging initiatives, particularly the eco-friendly initiatives; you just announced a big paper bottle solutions, investment, and plan. Could you talk more about that; the opportunity? And how important is that in terms of a growth driver for Jabil?\nMark Mondello: Well, won't be much of a growth driver this year. We have to be very, very, very selective in our M&A. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders but at the same time, and I made this comment around growth; you know, if we ever get to a point where we're not growing the company, then shame on us, but we have to do so in a margin-friendly cash flow-friendly way, which is I think, what I hope this year's results will start to prove out. And as part of that the good news is, almost all of our material growth is organic which is the best growth to have by two magnitudes, but we will continue to complement that with select M&A activity, and for us to put some dollars in play with the acquisition you're talking about is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great leadership, a company called Ecologic. We are very excited about the platform that they've developed, and we always ask ourselves the question; when we're looking at acquisitions we start with culture alignment, we start with capability and competency, and then what are we going to do with the business when we own it strategically. We have a wonderful roadmap internally around sustainable packaging, and this is kind of a second or third step for us, we believe that we'll be able to take that technology, and as we look towards fiscal '22, fiscal '23, give that technology -- it's due in terms of further R&D, and then giving that technology exposure to maybe bigger brands that we support based on our balance sheet, our scale and our relationships.\nMatt Sheeran: Okay, thanks very much.\nMark Mondello: Matt, you're welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The company's doing very well on margins and guiding to 4.2% for this year, despite what I would think are some temporary cost headwinds related to the supply chain environment, including the shipping cost as the most important component shortages that the whole industry is having to deal with. Can you talk about how much of a headwind the company may be seeing from some of those supply chain types of costs this year? And if we were to add that back, do you think that's more representative of the underlying margin levels that the company can hopefully build off of going forward? Or are there any other temporal factors that we should be thinking about that's influencing margins this year?\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Mark. You know, I -- geez [ph], I said earlier, we've -- we've certainly handicapped the business for Q3 and Q4, and I think our handicap has been appropriate. So I think that in and of itself might suggest that -- you know, if we didn't handicap the business, maybe margins would be 4.3% for the year, I wouldn't get much ahead of that. But I also mentioned earlier, Mark, the method to our madness in terms of supply chain management, it's wonderful. And just listening to others, either a few customers, suppliers or folks in our industry, we're navigating this thing beautifully, and it's a tough deal but the impact to us, I think will be minimal on a relative basis. And again, as we sit here today, we had a debrief from our entire procurement team last week, and we feel like this thing will start to show levels of relief, as we get into 1Q of 2022 and for sure, as we get into calendar 2022. So to frame out that timeframe, call it September, October, November timeframe; we'll start seeing relief. And then I think things will be back to more normal conditions, call it January, February, March of 2022. With that said, again, we gave the guidance we gave to today for Q3 and Q4, and I suddenly feel confident. And as I mentioned earlier, when you look at margins at 4.2 [ph] for the year, I think -- I think we're going to continue to effort to have an upward trajectory of that as we get into 2022, even with considerations of near-term supply changes.\nMark Delaney: That's very helpful. My follow-up question was on the EV opportunity, and automotive has been a growing business for Jabil, and an area I realized that Jabil has a lot of capabilities already; Foxconn is moving to divert or brought it out it's business in doing full electric vehicle architectures, and even final car assembly. I'm interested if that's the type of business that Jabil would also consider expanding into within the automotive and EV space? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: I think it's a part right [ph] to think that we'll set up automotive factories. The capital intensity, that is enormous, and I don't want our people focused away from what we do really, really well which is sensors, components, sub-assemblies for the entire automotive space; and thank you for the compliment on that, we do have a very good track record in automotive. One of the strategic decisions we made two and a half, three years ago was -- is all hands on in terms of really focusing hard on electrification and EV, not just with automobiles but all the transportation; and I think that -- I think that decision is paying dividends to us. When you think about the term electrification, that would suggest right in our core and the R&D dollars and the investments we've made in that area have been substantial; so I feel pretty good about how we're positioned there, and we'll see how that plays out for '22 and '23. If I had to speculate, make a little bit of a guess today; I think today we look at that the -- the H-sector [ph] chart and -- in FY '20 automotive transport was about $1.7 billion, in September we took that up to $1.9 billion. We're sitting here today saying it will be a bit over $2.2 billion. And I would -- if I had to venture a guess today, I would say the trajectory of that sector as we move through '22 is going to continue to be up and to the right. Thank you.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: This now concludes our call. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by offering a warm thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for your commitment and thank you for always making safety your top priority. And stepping back and reflecting for a moment, it's hard to believe that 12 months have passed since we first encountered COVID. I think about sitting alongside Mike and Adam one year ago, here in our March 2020 earnings call, when clarity vanished and uncertainty ran wild. Yet in typical Jabil fashion, our people did what they do; they dove in and gave their very best to combat the pandemic. They did so by looking after one another, while taking outstanding care of our customers. It's a point in time that I'll never forget; it's a point in time that highlights the level of respect and admiration that I have for our team here at Jabil. Their attitude and their actions continue to impress. And for sure, there is no other team I'd rather be part of. Again, much thanks to all of our employees who simply make Jabil, Jabil. Please turn to Slide 5 where we'll take a look at our 2Q results. Our second quarter came in well ahead of expectations, driven by stronger than expected product demand, solid execution and a well-balanced contribution throughout the entire company. The team delivered core earnings per share of $1.27 on revenue of $6.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%. I'm really pleased with our financial results for the quarter. Although, what's quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements we've made to our balance sheet. All in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '21. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY22. As customary, Mike will provide more detail around our second quarter results during his prepared remarks. I'd now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio. Slide 6 underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate. Today, our business is wide-ranging and resilient; this is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption or cyclical demand. Furthermore, our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities, innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers. It's a proven formula that's trusted by many of the world's most remarkable brands. Moving to Slide 7, I'll address our updated outlook for the year. We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of $5 a share, an increase of 25% from what we anticipated back in September with top line revenue coming in around $28.5 billion. This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another 10 basis point increase to core operating margin which we now forecast to be 4.2% for the year. Lastly, we remain committed to generating a minimum of $600 million in free cash flow, a testament to how we're managing our capital investments. As I wrap up the outlook, it's notable that our strategy is working, our path is well understood and how we go about producing results is important. On this last point, when we think about the how, we think about purpose; a purpose that guides us in our journey, a purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors; behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, ensuring a fully inclusive environment and giving back to our communities around the world. I'm just so proud that our team is hitting the mark in all of these areas. As we transition to my final slide, I want to once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two years to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as we've targeted growth in select markets; markets that largely align with secular trends. A few examples of these being 5G, personalized healthcare, electric vehicles, digital learning, cloud computing, clean energy and eco-friendly packaging. Our team continues to develop deep domain expertise in concert with these secular tailwinds. I like the decisions we're making and what we're doing, and we do what we do while respecting the environment and safeguarding our workplace. We're committed to a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance. We encourage each and every employee here at Jabil to be their true self. We strive to make the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier, and a little bit safer each and every day. One factor that makes good companies great is possessing a value system which allows them to solve problems over and over again; we embraced this way of thinking and welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. Thank you. And I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Thanks, Ruplu. I feel good about where the margin. I think you're right, we look at the overall corporate margin for the year, we think we'll be around 4.2%. And EMS will be in the range of I would guess 3.6%, 3.7%. I look at that relative to fiscal '19. If I go back that far, and I think EMS in '19, was around 3% all in. Last year, we're below that and I acknowledge that was a COVID year with excessive COVID expenses. But I feel pretty good about that business overall. I think we're doing the right things in cloud. I look at that business today in terms of a mix of legacy business, some businesses that we've gotten a bit of a nudge or help with COVID. But most importantly, Ruplu, I think about things that Mike was talking about in his prepared remarks in terms of trends that we think are going to be around for a while. Things like 5G, electric vehicles, cloud computing, clean energy.  So I feel good about the year. We continue to make OpEx investments as well in the EMS segment, but I think we're on a good trajectory. The things I obsess about or worry about. The condition of the EMS business, the next two, three years isn't one of them. I don't want to speculate on any configuration changes or anything like that. Our relationship in that space with our main customer there is super solid. And when I just think back about the last two, three years of execution, I've got again, very little doubt in our ability to execute on the mobility side, configuration changes or not. So again, not an area that then I'm losing a lot of sleep over. Yes, thanks Adam. Q3 is always a little bit of a debit for us. And, as much as we take a lot of I don't know if the words pride we feel really good about the overall mixing of the business. What we've done in the last two, three years. But again, we always see a little bit of a soft spot in terms of enterprise level, in terms of up margin. I think you're right, enterprise margins for Q3 will be around the 3.5% range. And, again, I compare that to last year, which maybe it's nonsense, because of COVID it's up substantially year-on-year. I'm going off a memory, but I got to believe that if we went back to fiscal '19, we'd be up year-on-year in terms of Q3 to Q3 as well. So none of it has anything to do with reflection of the business other than for certain parts of our business as you know, Q3 tends to be more of an investment quarter on an OpEx line than the other quarters. The thing that I'm focused on more than anything is beginning of the year.  So we've had, we've strung together, I don't know, adding four, five years where the overall enterprise up margin line has been bouncing around 3.5%. That says we've really been focused on adding good quality growth to the company. And in September, we gave an outlook that said for the year we do a four handle on up margin. 90 days ago in December, we took that up to four one now we're taking that up to four two. So I feel, I'm more focused on that trajectory than the quarter-on-quarter results. And in terms of your comments forward looking beyond '21, we'll give more detail around that in the Investor Day in September, I had said something in my prepared remarks today around the fact that we're very focused on continuing a positive direction with margins as we get into fiscal '22. And that would be relative to the four two, that we hope to post this year. Thanks, Jim. I assume you're talking about our eight sectors [ph]. Yes, so, I'm not quite sure we mean, in terms of surprise, in terms of the uplift, for sure. So I don't know that it's a surprise to us that we're seeing strength in 5G and cloud. Back in December, we knew that there was going to be some component shortages and constraints. But we've been very bullish on the 5G wireless infrastructure and cloud area of our business. So whether surprised or not, it's certainly an area where we continue to see strength. And I think that's largely both on the 5G side and the cloud side. Our services and our solutions are being well accepted and embraced out in the marketplace. So feel really good about that area of the business. In terms of supply constraints, I would say that we talked about this a bit in December, let's say, nine months ago, or so. You know, there was demand drops everywhere, based on COVID. I think that people took a lot of their demand signals, cut them abruptly. And then, at least our conversations with our customers, very few people anticipated the rebound that we've seen, which largely started August, September timeframe, and a bit to our surprise is continued to be very strong through early stages of 2021. And on the supply side, again, all of that drove constraints.  One good piece of information, I think to share is any type of supply constraints, whether it be around resin, whether it be around silicon, whether it be around passives, whether it be around mechanicals all that's handicapped into our numbers and I would actually say that we took a fairly deep handicap to that for our Q3 and Q4. So I feel if anything, maybe there's some slight upsides to what we've put out today, assuming that the supply constraints don't work and worse. And the other thing I would say is, I think the procurement team at Jabil just simply the best team in the business. And if I think about our scale, if I think about our holistic approach to demand planning, whether that cuts across healthcare or mobility or EMS business or automotive, our team's knowledge of the marketplace, the knowledge of the commodities, knowledge of technologies, and in the long standing relationships we have is really allowing us to navigate what otherwise is a tough component market at the moment. So I feel we're getting along and getting by quite well, all things considered on a relative basis. Hey Steve, somehow you cut off. If you could repeat them, that'd be great. Yes, thank you. So on the healthcare side, I think we're -- I think we continue to hit it on all cylinders. Steve Borges [ph] and his team who run that business, we started talking about the JJMD relationship. I don't even know how long ago now to 2.5 years ago, we kind of laid out a roadmap there and our health care team has executed nearly flawlessly to the roadmap that we laid out. So feel good about that and then the business around the JJMD. And I talked in my prepared remarks about different trends. And the team is really focused on things like for health care, like personalized health, like digital health. We announced sometime during the quarter, another relationship that has everything to do with technology around auto injection and auto injectors. And so I just look at the technology, the investments that our healthcare teams are making, and feel really good about that. Our healthcare and packaging business, speed, last year, I think was in the neighborhood of $4.1 billion, $4.2 billion. And I would guess, as we exit this year, health care and packaging, we'll be bumping up against $5 billion. And I think we'll continue to see good solid growth in that area for the next two to three years.  In terms of the $600 million of cash flow it's another number that I feel really good about and on the surface. Maybe it's a little bit confusing, because EBITDA is going up and margins are going up. So why wouldn't cash flow go up? We have been working diligently to continue to shape the portfolio. Our number one focus as our leadership team is cash flows and management over the next two, three, four years. I think if we ever get to a point where as a leadership team, we decide not to grow the company. That would be a perilous thing to do and makes no sense to us as long as we're adding good quality business, again, attached to secular trends that allow us to continue to expand margins, as we look at '22 and '23. So if I take you back to the beginning of the year, we said we do $26.5 billion, $27 billion in revenue. Now we're bumping up against $28 billion, $28.5 billion. And with the additional top line with the way the teams managing working capital, the way the team's managing CapEx, and then Mike alluded to the fact that we were going to complete our buyback authorization by August 31 of the year.  So I think we're being well balanced in terms of both capital investments, OpEx investments and shareholders. I feel good about the $600 million plus. And then we'll give an update to what I think you should anticipate is stronger cash flows as we get into the Investor Day in September. I don't know that it's structural to our industry. I hope so. I think if our competition can lock in higher margins that's always good but we're pretty inwardly focused, Paul. I think about first and foremost we obsess about customer care and customer solutions. And I think, if we don't get that out of order, Paul, and we continue to obsess about our customers and what they need in solving their issues; the financials will follow. If I step back and I look at this fiscal year, I was noticing something over the weekend, this will be along with the margin trajectory, I think this would be the first year we've ever had in the history of the company, if we execute, and that's a big capital, if but if we execute, we're going to string together four consecutive quarters where every single quarter is at or exceeds $1 per share. And that just kind of jumped off the page. But in terms of margin expansion, you asked about is it structural? I think so. That's our plan and that's what will allow us to take margins up from the 4.2%, as we get into next year.  And I think about everything from our balance sheet, if you take a look at, and again, now I'm coming at it a little bit more from an EPS perspective. But since you asked the question around is it structural. Our balance sheet continues to improve, net debts going down, interest expense is going down. Overall, liquidity has gone up. And then I take a look at the business and I look at things like I think we have very, very good overhead and overhead costs, I think about overall demand, I think about the secular trends that we've talked about, sometimes that's a really, really overused term. But we are truly embedded in so many of those markets, which I think are going to be around for the next two or three years. And then, the whole COVID thing, it's not behind us yet. But with the vaccine being here, we hope to have 70%, 80% of our employees globally have access to the vaccine over the next six to eight months. It's just and then I think lastly, and we've been talking about this for 10 to 12 quarters is the mix of our businesses as healthy as it's ever been.  So I think you shake all that stuff up together. And again, I take a look at the last couple years margins have been around 3.5%. I think that there's a real opportunity here for us to, on a structural basis, increase margins by 100 basis points as we look forward after that 3.5% base. I think it starts with absolute clarity, communication to the troops internally. You know, I can tell you this, I've been with the company a long time. Right screw things up is when I have stuff in my head with the leadership team and we don't communicate it to the group. What I can tell you and the reciprocal of that is when the group understands where we're going and why we're going there and what our purpose is there's no better team, there just isn't. And so people understand that there's two things that we're focused on for the next two, three, four years, and that's continued expansion of cash flows, and continued expansion and margins. And by the way, our portfolio, we kind of refer to as a portfolio for a reason. We have some business that might be a little softer on the margin side, but based on terms based on the business itself have tremendous cash flows. And we have other businesses that have tremendous margin, but maybe the working capital is a little richer, we have some of that in our healthcare, space and other areas. But when you blend all that together, I think there's just a picture here, that we're just starting to paint. And, again, we feel pretty good for the next two to three years.  To answer your question directly. We're just going to stay away from bad business. And you know that that could mean a variety of things. But I think internally people are pretty clear on what we're going to go after. Certainly, if we can go after business where there's going to be positive trends going forward. It's goodness for everybody. But I think I think the organization is pretty clear about the type of businesses we're not going to go after. Shannon, I'd say and I don't want to be offensive by not getting into details. I would say this with a high degree of confidence. For sure, we're seeing stretch secular trends and trends that are very positive in terms of cloud and finally, what looks to be reasonable plans in terms of the 5G Wireless rollout. So that's going to be helpful. And we think that's here to stay for, not a number of months, but a number of years. And by the way, we think that's going to have all kinds of tangents tied to it as well, once the 5G rollout gets underway in terms of derivatives to other parts of our business. And then I think I complement that with saying, there's just been good acceptance of our solutions and our services in the space, both on the design side, I think Mike alluded to, he was using some fancy terms around, what we call a kind of designed to dust and repurposing older servers. And he did a nice job explaining it, but it sounds a little, I don't know, overly technical or whatever. But when we talk about the design side, all the way to repositioning and disposing of older hardware, kind of front to back, I think, Shannon, the solutions we have in that space. Again, it's still what I would call early days, but had been received quite well. And I would also suggest that there is some market share wins in there as well. Yes, thanks. Let me break up the back half of '21 with '22 and '23. I can't make sense of the US equity markets anymore, because I don't know how they got detached from fundamentals in so many ways. I just think that when you put $4 trillion of stimulus into the system, and there's dollars everywhere, they got to go somewhere. I think that stimulus will be a bit of a driver for the next couple quarters, maybe into 1Q of '22. But the nice thing is, so as we navigate '21, I see two things. I see certain parts of our business being driven by what I would call COVID type behaviors, some of those will dissipate, some of those maintain. I see certain parts of our business that are stimulus-related. In certain parts of the United States right now, you go and you try to buy a truck or car, an appliance, whatever it may be; there is backlogs everywhere, and I think that's stimulus related. But as the impact of stimulus, and the impact of COVID start to attenuate a bit and fall off of it, I think what's right behind that is kind of -- no kidding, no nonsense secular trends. And again, Mike talked about it, I talked about it in our prepared remarks; and I think those specific trends certainly will be a driver for our business the next two, three, four years, so it's not like I'm sitting here going, geez, when stimulus abates [ph], when COVID types of hardware either go away or reduce -- that there is not going to be other elements that continue to give us a little bit of an uplift. So, I don't know if that helps or gets at your question, but that's how I see it. Yes, thank you. Yes, sure. So the network storage business was around $2.8 billion in fiscal '20. September, we took that all the way down to $2.2 billion, and again, that's a reflection of a couple of things; it's a reflection of some of the legacy business may be starting to lose footing, and lose a little traction out in the marketplace. Number two is; again as we continue to think about our portfolio for fiscal '22 and '23, there are certain areas of that business that when we think about our overall invested capital, might not make sense for us any longer but the nice thing is, from the September timeframe to December timeframe, to today, we've actually been on a trajectory back up. So that's nothing more than, A) we have tremendous relationships with certain customers in that space; and we'll continue to serve those customers, serve them well; and as long as they'll have us, and appreciate the value we provide, we're all in. And -- so I -- again, I think about $2.8 billion in '20 to down $2.2 billion in the last -- I think December, and today we've taken it back up by $200 million roughly. And I would just look at -- I'd look at network and storage as a -- a very key element of our eight sector makeup. And I would say that even though in some of those businesses, margins might be tight, cash flows are quite good, so it's a very good complement to the other seven sectors. Well, won't be much of a growth driver this year. We have to be very, very, very selective in our M&A. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders but at the same time, and I made this comment around growth; you know, if we ever get to a point where we're not growing the company, then shame on us, but we have to do so in a margin-friendly cash flow-friendly way, which is I think, what I hope this year's results will start to prove out. And as part of that the good news is, almost all of our material growth is organic which is the best growth to have by two magnitudes, but we will continue to complement that with select M&A activity, and for us to put some dollars in play with the acquisition you're talking about is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great leadership, a company called Ecologic. We are very excited about the platform that they've developed, and we always ask ourselves the question; when we're looking at acquisitions we start with culture alignment, we start with capability and competency, and then what are we going to do with the business when we own it strategically. We have a wonderful roadmap internally around sustainable packaging, and this is kind of a second or third step for us, we believe that we'll be able to take that technology, and as we look towards fiscal '22, fiscal '23, give that technology -- it's due in terms of further R&D, and then giving that technology exposure to maybe bigger brands that we support based on our balance sheet, our scale and our relationships. Matt, you're welcome. Thanks, Mark. You know, I -- geez [ph], I said earlier, we've -- we've certainly handicapped the business for Q3 and Q4, and I think our handicap has been appropriate. So I think that in and of itself might suggest that -- you know, if we didn't handicap the business, maybe margins would be 4.3% for the year, I wouldn't get much ahead of that. But I also mentioned earlier, Mark, the method to our madness in terms of supply chain management, it's wonderful. And just listening to others, either a few customers, suppliers or folks in our industry, we're navigating this thing beautifully, and it's a tough deal but the impact to us, I think will be minimal on a relative basis. And again, as we sit here today, we had a debrief from our entire procurement team last week, and we feel like this thing will start to show levels of relief, as we get into 1Q of 2022 and for sure, as we get into calendar 2022. So to frame out that timeframe, call it September, October, November timeframe; we'll start seeing relief. And then I think things will be back to more normal conditions, call it January, February, March of 2022. With that said, again, we gave the guidance we gave to today for Q3 and Q4, and I suddenly feel confident. And as I mentioned earlier, when you look at margins at 4.2 [ph] for the year, I think -- I think we're going to continue to effort to have an upward trajectory of that as we get into 2022, even with considerations of near-term supply changes. I think it's a part right [ph] to think that we'll set up automotive factories. The capital intensity, that is enormous, and I don't want our people focused away from what we do really, really well which is sensors, components, sub-assemblies for the entire automotive space; and thank you for the compliment on that, we do have a very good track record in automotive. One of the strategic decisions we made two and a half, three years ago was -- is all hands on in terms of really focusing hard on electrification and EV, not just with automobiles but all the transportation; and I think that -- I think that decision is paying dividends to us. When you think about the term electrification, that would suggest right in our core and the R&D dollars and the investments we've made in that area have been substantial; so I feel pretty good about how we're positioned there, and we'll see how that plays out for '22 and '23. If I had to speculate, make a little bit of a guess today; I think today we look at that the -- the H-sector [ph] chart and -- in FY '20 automotive transport was about $1.7 billion, in September we took that up to $1.9 billion. We're sitting here today saying it will be a bit over $2.2 billion. And I would -- if I had to venture a guess today, I would say the trajectory of that sector as we move through '22 is going to continue to be up and to the right. Thank you. Yes, thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Mark just detailed, our second quarter performance was outstanding driven by the combination of broad-based end-market strength and associated leverage, and improved portfolio mix and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. We saw broad-based revenue strength across the business, most notably in mobility, cloud, healthcare, connected devices, automotive and semi-cap. Given the additional revenue, I am particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter which enabled us deliver a strong core operating margin of 4.2%. And finally, our net interest expense came in better than expected during the quarter, due in large part to better working capital management coupled with the proactive steps we've taken over the past year to optimize our capital structure. Putting it all together on the next slide, net revenue for the second quarter was $6.8 billion, $300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by $700 million or 11%. GAAP operating income was $236 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.99. Core operating income during the quarter was $285 million, an increase of 78% year-over-year representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q2 was $33 million and core tax rate came in at approximately 23%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 154% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now, turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.6 billion, an increase of 26% on a year-over-year basis. The strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broad-based as several of the end-markets we serve are becoming increasingly critical such as connected devices, healthcare, automotive and mobility. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 5.1%, 210 basis points higher than the previous year, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment was $3.2 billion, also reflecting strong broad-based demand. Core margins for the segment were 3.1%, 80 basis points over the prior year. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were $20 million in Q2 and capital expenditures, net of customer co-investments, totaled $152 million. We exited the quarter with cash balance of $838 million. We ended Q2 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q2 with access to more than $4.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for $82 million. At the end of the quarter $254 million remained outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization, and we intend to complete this authorization during the second half of FY '21 as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Turning now to our third quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 19% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 billion; this is mainly due to strong end-market outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3.4 billion, an increase of 1% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting our EMS business remained strong and healthy. The modest increase is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '21 to be in the range of $6.6 billion to $7.2 billion or an increase of 9% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $220 million to $270 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.89. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to provide an update on the long-term secular trends underway across our businesses which we believe will drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY '21 and beyond. In healthcare today, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently, we are witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. We're in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products that help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare. Another end-market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. Today, electric vehicles account for less than 2% of total vehicles in the market. Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. As a result, OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort. Jabil's long-standing capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend. Turning now to 5G; 5G will transform the way we live, work, play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out, 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both, the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This, coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers, is helping us gain market share in an expanding market, evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years. The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to dust capabilities which incorporates engineering, manufacturing and eco-friendly decommissioning observers [ph], all within collocated facilities. This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times, security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our US domicile hyperscalers. Shifting now to packaging; we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and eco-friendly packaging. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste, demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating. And then finally, within semi-cap, the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs. Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicon today. Jabil serves the semi-cap space with end-to-end solutions, spanning the front-end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back-end with validation and test solutions. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business which has allowed us to deliver much better-than-expected results in the first half of FY '21. As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond, we fully expect the long-term secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY '21 estimates for revenue, core operating income, core margins and core earnings per share. We now expect core operating margins to be 4.2% on revenue of approximately $28.5 billion [ph]. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately $5. And importantly, despite the stronger growth we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam. Thanks, Adam. Yes, definitely free cash flow will, I think we've said more than $600 million for this year, as we continue into FY '22. I expect that to continue to grow. Again, we've said this before CapEx is something where we've been extremely disciplined in that 2.9%, 3% range. So free cash flows next year again, we'll get guidance in September, but I expect that to go up on a similar unraid [ph] as it's done in FY '21. As relates to capital allocation Adam, we continue to be sort of well balanced. We continue with our buybacks. I talked about our buybacks in my prepared remarks, we have to earn $34 million left of our authorization, we intend to complete their authorization in Q3 and Q4 or in the second half of the year. So that shows that we're extremely committed to the buyback program. And that will continue into '22, '23. I don't want to preempt anything now. But I'm sure we'll be continuing that progress from a buyback standpoint. Most of the, I think we laid out a few quarters ago the capital allocation percentages, roughly half buys into buybacks, dividends, some of the balance of that goes into debt restructuring and the balance would be opportunistic, sort of M&A as well. So well balanced. Capital allocation continues going forward."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's first quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today's call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website. Before handing the call over to Mark, I'd like to now ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected second quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31st, 2020 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by offering my sincere gratitude to all of you here at Jabil, and thanks for hanging in there during these trying times, while making safety your number one priority. At Jabil, we're fundamentally in the people business. The manner in which we care for and accept one another is truly what makes us who we are today. And again, thank you. Let's please turn to Slide 5, where we'll look at our results for the first quarter. The quarter came in well ahead of expectations, as the team delivered core operating income of $365 million on record revenue of $7.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The 4.7% margin is a 100 basis point increase year-on-year Q1 2021 to Q1 2020, which as a reminder, was a pre-COVID quarter occurring in September, October and November of 2019. Moreover, I'm really pleased with the financial makeup of the quarter. Well-balanced contributions from our EMS and DMS segments, supplemented with substantial upsides from our cloud computing, connected devices and mobility sectors. Q1 overall gives us excellent momentum to what looks to be another outstanding year. As is customary, Mike will provide more detail around our Q1 results during his prepared remarks. Moving to Slide 6, you'll see a terrific illustration, which underscores the effectiveness of our team. When I look at the slide, what gets me most enthused is the fact that we get one plus one equals three in so many ways across our two business segments. One example of this are the financial goals and objectives for each segment. Our DMS segment focuses on expanding margins, while offering reliable cash flows, while our EMS segment focuses on expanding cash flows while offering reliable margins, perfect complements that fortify our financial results. These two segments placed side-by-side underpin our resiliency, especially when an individual product or product family is faced with the macro disruption, cyclical demand or unforeseen market dynamics. Speaking of a macro disruption, today, more than ever, I look at Jabil as an essential business and a trusted partner. Essential and trusted in a sustainable sense, knowing that Jabil is a primary manufacturing partner that supports a few trillion dollars of market value. Day in and day out, we deliver high-quality products while solving and simplifying complex challenges for the customers we so humbly serve. Add to this, the collaboration embedded in our model, plus the deep domain expertise and a longstanding culture of always doing what's right. It's a proven formula which stimulates progress. And since we're on the topic of progress, let's turn to Slide 7, where we see management's outlook for the year. Not only is the Company well positioned to exceed our financial goals around margins for the year, but we're now predicting core earnings per share will be in the range of $4.60, up 15% compared to 90 days ago and up 55% to 60% when compared to fiscal year 2020. This meaningful increase to earnings is largely driven by two catalysts. The first being our well-diversified commercial portfolio, which gives us a firm and steady foundation on which to operate our business. And the second being the reduction of our net interest expense, driven by proactive steps we've taken over the past nine months to 12 months. I'd like to offer another round of thanks to our employees. Your stamina and collective efforts in placing the needs of the customer first has enabled an additional $1 billion of revenue for the year. Wonderful mix of revenue and leverage allowing us the opportunity to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.1% for the year. A clear reflection of our actions, specifically when it comes to margin expansion and growth of earnings. Furthermore, we will give continued attention to core areas of differentiation and investment. Areas like our homogenous IT framework, factory automation and machine learning, back office data analytics and specialized supply chain tools, all in the name of greater efficiencies and performance. In closing this morning, I do want to share a thought that encompasses our team. Delivering for shareholders and serving our customers is a must, but we'll only do so by respecting our environmental and social responsibilities, while also safeguarding Jabil's workplace to ensure every Jabil employee can be their true self with acceptance of individual differences. With that, please keep safe and I wish all of you a peaceful holiday. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was an exceptional quarter. The team delivered record results on three fronts: revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share. We saw broad-based strength across both segments, which allowed us to deliver financial results that came in above what we expected in September. Our overperformance in the quarter was largely driven by three factors. For starters, our multi-year journey to both diversify and reposition the Company continues to pay dividends. During the quarter, our healthcare, automotive and semi-cap businesses all performed at or near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Consequently, these results alone would have put us near the top end of our guidance range for Q1. On top of this, during the quarter, a few of our highly regarded strategic customers in our mobility, connected devices and cloud businesses experienced unexpected high levels of demand in Q1, which caused revenue to come in much higher than expected. Clearly, our value proposition across key end markets continues to resonate with customers as a result of our unique set of capabilities in design, engineering and global supply chain and manufacturing. And then finally, our interest and tax expense came in better than expected. The proactive steps we've taken over the last few quarters to bolster our balance sheet afforded us the flexibility to efficiently access the debt capital markets, thereby reducing net interest expense during the quarter. The compounding effects of higher-than-expected revenue and the associated leverage, along with lower interest and tax expense, allowed us to deliver record revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in Q1. With that, I will now review our Q1 financial results. Net revenue for the first quarter was $7.8 billion, $800 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by $300 million or 4% despite our strategic shift to a consignment model within our cloud business. GAAP operating income was $314 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.31. Core operating income during the quarter was $365 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%, a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. I am particularly pleased with solid operating leverage as a result of our optimized cost structure and strong demand. As I mentioned a moment ago, our net interest expense came in better than expected at $34.4 million, approximately $13 million better than expected and our core tax rate was also better than expected at 25.7%. Core diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.60, a 52% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our first quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.2 billion, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned earlier, the strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broad-based. Core margins for the segment improved 70 basis points over the prior year to 5.7%. It's worth noting, during Q1, we saw an abrupt and unanticipated intra-quarter strengthening of the renminbi versus the U.S. dollar, which weighed on our DMS core margins by an estimated 50 basis points. Nonetheless, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment also came in strong at $3.6 billion, reflecting robust demand in semicap, digital print and cloud. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 3.4%, 100 basis points higher than the previous year and well above expectations. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q1, inventory days came in better than expected at 55 days. Cash flows provided by operations was $65 million in Q1 and net capital expenditures totaled $242 million. We exited the quarter with cash balances of $1.1 billion. We ended Q1 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q1 with access to more than $4.9 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for $50 million. Turning now to our second quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 22% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 billion. This is mainly due to strong end-market outlook and a favorable year-over-year comparison. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3 billion, a decrease of 8% on a year-over-year basis, reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total Company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '21 to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion for an increase of 6% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $210 million to $260 million with core operating margin in the range of 3.4% to 3.8%. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.83 to $1.03. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.82. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Over the last several quarters, we repositioned our business to serve critical and long life cycle products, while also providing the foundation for predictable yet strong cash flows and margins. As part of this journey, we've reshaped and will continue to reshape the portfolio, further improving the mix of our business. Our DMS business is in incredibly good shape today, headlined by nearly $5 billion healthcare and packaging business which serves many of the most critical healthcare, medical device and consumer packaged goods companies in the world. The convergence of technology in our daily lives expedited by 5G and remote work and learn environments continues to drive our mobility and connected devices business. With over 50 years of experience serving the automotive industry, including a 10-year partnership with the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, we are well-positioned for continued growth. Jabil has made an intentional and early shift towards supporting technologies that enable autonomous, connected and electrified vehicles. Our investments and expertise in these areas have allowed us to capture new business with some of the world's leading OEMs and Tier 1s. In EMS, we participate in the design, product development, industrialization and manufacturing with some of the most sophisticated tech products in the marketplace today. Supporting these markets requires an ability to manage large, complex material supply chains with sophisticated IT systems that enable us to manage change and mitigate potential risk to our customers' supply chain at a rapid pace. Today, our EMS business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide us with confidence in future earnings and cash flow generation. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the robust start to the year. For the year, we now anticipate revenues will be up roughly $1 billion from prior guidance and core operating margin has increased 10 basis points to 4.1%. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of $4.60 for the year. And importantly, despite the stronger-than-expected growth and associated working capital, we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts. I would like to wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks Mike. As we begin the Q&A session, I'd like to remind our call participants that per our customer agreements, we cannot address any customer or product-specific questions. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, thanks. Good morning and congrats on the strong results and outlook. Mark, I wanted to start on the outlook, the $4.60 for the full-year and go into this question with acknowledging you've done what you said you're going to do, have a very good track record, but I think that incremental $0.60 implies an increase in the back half of the fiscal year. I know you're getting some benefit in the first-half, but still an increase in the back half of the fiscal year. And just wanted to ask what gave you the confidence to raise that far out? Imagine we're going to get some investor questions with the context that mobility seems like an unusual potential cycle, uncertain ending. There's something different about this fiscal year level of visibility that you had versus years passed where ending of the cycles has surprised the supply chain?\nMark Mondello: I don't know that I look at a timeframe change. I mean, we - in September, we talked about the full-year at $4. So, we felt compelled to address the $4 or a change to it. So I don't think anything has changed in terms of confidence of the business relative to September. If I break the answer up into a couple of things: one, we - we've been on the six, seven-year journey, where we've really focused - we focused a number of years on driving the top line, because our strategic belief in a business like us when we're a service business, the more diversified we become, the more resilient, the more predictable, the better the Company is. And so, it was all hands on deck. And what's interesting, Adam, about that is the proof is in the pudding. One could say, geez, you guys chased a lot of growth. That's true, but we went through a period of time from fiscal 2016 to - I think even fiscal 2019, maybe fiscal 2015 to 2019. We're through a lot of the period of time when we were diversifying the margins of the corporation at an enterprise level were around 3.5%. And I would contend that we must have done a pretty good job of the diversification, not only diversifying the different end markets, but the quality of - the quality of revenue we brought into the Company, which has allowed us largely to come into this year and offer $4 a share. The second part of your question in terms of the $4.60. I think what I just said gives us confidence in the $4.60. We had a midpoint of $1.25 for 1Q. We delivered a $1.60. So you take a look at the spread on that to start the year and that spread going from the $1.25 to a $1.60 was really broken down I think into three parts. One was there is a few areas of our business that we saw very strong demand. Number two is just the overall construct of the portfolio. Number three is Dastoor, Sergio and our finance team have done a wonderful job over the last six, nine months or so working the balance sheet. And so, we're starting to see some foundational positive changes to interest expense. So you shake that up to start the year, and then we - I think with our 2Q guide, I don't know consensus was around high-80s and I think our midpoint is $0.92, $0.93. So we took Q2 up a $0.05. And that, we're in the middle of 2Q now, so we got reasonable visibility to that. And then as we look at the back half of the year, Adam, if I just think about revenue, so back in September, we started the year would be about $26.5 billion, maybe $27 billion. Now it's looking more or like $27.5 billion. About $800 million, $900 million of that is in the front half. $100 million to $200 million is in the back half, which I think addresses your point in terms of - it's a reasonable blend throughout the year. And again, when I think about - when I think about the $0.60 delta, I think, about a combination of again the strong portfolio. And then, I also think about the foundational change to interest and tax, probably leaning more towards interest and tax, I would say, of the - going from $4 to $4.60. $0.25 to $0.30 is kind of foundational interest in tax, which is I think a huge positive. And then the balance of that would be the portfolio itself.\nAdam Tindle: Okay, that's very helpful.\nMark Mondello: Something else I think is worth noting. We thought long and hard on how do we - we felt compelled to update the year, right? And because we started with a look to the year in September. So, we thought long and hard on how conservative do we want to be and we just kind of laid out the numbers and we went over this multiple times. And to us, $4.60 feels like a good number. But I think what's really, really important for this call is to suggest that as a leadership team, that $4.60 and the 4.1% that we - that we've now put out there is our outlook for the year. I think a very important element of that is the $4.60 and the 4.1% are now kind of foundational for us to build off of for fiscal 2022. So I think that's - I don't think that point should be lost.\nAdam Tindle: That's helpful. Yes, that definitely doesn't stop there. Mike, I wanted to just on a follow-up on CapEx. Mobility is upsiding, forecasts are increasing. In the past, as this happened, CapEx crept up over the course of the year. Just curious, you talked on the last call about keeping CapEx flattish year-over-year. I think you maintained your free cash flow guidance this year. What's enabling this upcycle to be different than previous cycles, where CapEx increased? How can you maintain share, if you don't increase capacity?\nMike Dastoor: Adam. That's a good question. I think we've been - I'm extremely pleased with the discipline that we're showing on the CapEx front. The entire team is being extremely thoughtful about CapEx. And we're pushing back on customers where we feel that the CapEx is not warranted. So good discipline, Adam. I would sort of think of CapEx at a 3 percent-ish rate on revenue. I think we've been 2.9%, we've been 3.1%. We've been 3% in the last four, five years, but I think a 3% sounds like a good sort of gauge for CapEx going forward.\nMark Mondello: Adam, if I could comment on something that I think you hit on that. I also think I wouldn't want loss, because there is a lot of numbers - good numbers on this call. And as we were growing the business and focusing on diversification, and I would now contend we're well diversified. So it's a journey, but I think the Company is very well diversified at the moment, again, result of a lot of hard work and effort. But two things happen when you're in that type of mode. Number one is we got a little bit fluffy in terms of headcount and overhead and we dealt with a lot of that this past summer. That's coming through in the results. Number two is the working capital management. And the working capital management, I've seen out of our team in the last six to nine months has been absolutely fabulous. And I think the fact that we're looking, our outlook reflects another $1 billion of revenue for the year and we're still keeping cash flows north of $600 million speaks volumes of that in terms of us being very, very intentional on working capital and working capital management.\nAdam Tindle: Yes. It seems like a structural change. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup Investment Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much, Mark and Mike, and congratulations to you and your team and for being safe as well as delivering results. My question is again on your capital discipline and big upside. The question I have is, any commentary you can give about like utilization rates or machine optimization rates or something like that? Because it just seems like you're getting more and more efficiencies out of your plants and equipments. If I understand it correctly, because it sounds like you're not having to really invest a significant more amount of capital and therefore returning more cash flow. Can you comment a little bit on that because I think some people may wonder are you maxing out and not able to fit any more business into your sites, whether it be healthcare, whether it be packaging, whether it be DMS? Any commentary would be great. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim. I'll try it in a couple of different ways. One is, as Mike said, I think it's - I think a good proxy for modeling going forward is CapEx to be about 3 points of revenue, plus or minus. Some quarters, it will be less. Some quarters, it will be more. Here's what we can I think assure you on. If CapEx goes up a bit, actually look at that as a good thing because with the disciplines we've put in, with the company being well-diversified, the pipeline that we have today on an organic basis, it's probably about $3.5 billion, $4 billion of topline, which by the way we absolutely will intentionally walk away from some of that. So the kind of the purposeful nature of bringing additional topline into the Company I think is as high as it's ever been. If CapEx were to go up to 3.1% or 3.2% or something like that, again, you can be rest assured that that's going to be accretive both the cash flows and margins going forward and by the way in a relatively short-term basis in terms of bringing the business on. So - but that's kind of one. Number 2 is getting back to your question specifically around factories. What our operational people have done? And we - the genesis of what we do for living is we build stuff. We have - everybody is important. Our finance group is important, HR is important, commercial - but our operational people are at the very core of what we do, Jim. And what they've done in terms of navigating COVID, keeping our factories up and running. I said something in my prepared remarks around the fact that COVID has proven to us to be an essential business, but I think of essential two ways. One is, essential around COVID, but on a more sustainable basis. We're an essential business because when you sit back and think about our size and scale today and the fact that we kind of build a little bit of everything, we really do - we really do help support and partner to a few trillion dollars of market cap. And what our operational team did, getting back to your question around factory utilization and efficiencies through COVID, was miraculous. And by the way, we did that with a de minimis amount of COVID cases. And by the way, I want to be careful with that statement, because those were COVID did impact them was very binary. But when I think about back to utilization through this pandemic, a huge shout out to our operational teams. As I look forward, Jim, for the balance of the year, our factories are running at what I would - what I would call very normalized utilization rates. And there is - there is nothing there that gives me pause that says the CapEx is going to have to go to 4% or 4.5% of revenue, because there's going to be some big step function in terms of additional capacity. And the last - the last thing I'd like to comment relative to your question is, is we've also been talking for the last three, four or five years on the OpEx investments that we're making, which our OpEx investments are probably $100 million a year. And that's kind of what I would call progressive IT, factory of the future, machine learning, data automation, much of which affects our factory floors in terms of productivity and efficiencies. So, I think it's a combination of all of that stuff.\nJim Suva: And as my follow-up, in the past, many of the supply chains have talked about component shortages whether it be microprocessors or memory or capacitors or something like that. Has the component shortages completely worked itself out because I know now you have a strong position in cloud as well as mobility? Any thoughts around component shortages. And is that backlog completely worked through, or is there still some shortages out there that could have actually give you more upside?\nMark Mondello: I'll give you a two-part answer to that. Number 1, I'll give that's a great - that's a great opening for me to give a shout out to our supply chain folks. If you - as you do, Jim, you know us around the industry, we have - I think we have fundamentally one of the most respected supply chain global teams in the world and they do a fabulous job for us when markets get tight and otherwise. With that being said, of the 100 or 200 things that Dastoor and I worry about day in and day out with our team, as we sit today, supply shortages is one of them.\nOperator: The next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results and the strong guide. I have two questions, one on DMS and one on EMS. Maybe on the diversified manufacturing side, can you give us some guidance on seasonality and margin progression during the year? Given that automotive is now part of that segment. And in mobility, if we have - if we continue to have two launches of phones every year. Should we still expect that the third quarter would be the lowest margin quarter for DMS? Or - any guidance on quarter-to-quarter seasonality and margin progression would be very helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Okay, Ruplu. If I don't give you a complete answer, shout back at me because there was quite a bit there and I was kind of thinking through it, as you were talking. I think - I don't know what order I'll get this in, but let me try a couple of things. I think - I think foundationally, fundamentally, however you want to look at it, the thing - we talked a lot about diversification. And I know your question was largely around DMS, but if I could, for a moment. The most amazing thing today about the construct of the Company is - is if you extrapolate out the numbers that we've given today, you could - DMS will be in the range of about $15 billion for the year topline. EMS will be in the range of about $12.5 billion topline. That's with the new model on our cloud services business. And then you look at these complementary segments, Ruplu, DMS today - and again, this isn't hard and fast guidepost, but it's directionally how we think about the business and behave. Our DMS segment, so the $15 billion is the way to think about that is, it's about expanding margins and ensuring good reliable cash flows. The complement to that on the EMS side, which is a $12.5 billion, is really about expanding cash flows, while being sure that they focus on reliable margins. And those complements, as I said in my prepared notes, is I really think we get one plus one equals three. More specific to your question, when I think about kind of the year overall, I - Q1, we saw some - we saw - in Q1, we saw strength across the entire business other than maybe two or three pockets. So say out of - out of 10 to 12 pockets of business, let's say, two, three, four were neutral to slightly down, but it was just one of these quarters where everything kind of - everything kind of connected, whether it be mobility, connected devices, cloud, automotive transport, healthcare packaging, semicap, even network and storage. So - and then pockets of industrial as well. And again, it's just another illustration of the real promise of being diversified. As I think about the year going forward, I would think we'll continue to see reasonable strength across most - all of those end markets unless there is a big macro disruption and we'll see what happens today with the - or this week with the stimulus plan, but - and again, I think that - that leads us to why we have a degree of confidence in the $4.60. And then, there was another part of your question, I believe Ruplu specific to our mobility sector. In terms of shape of the year for the Company, I would say - I would say, we just printed a 4.7% margin in 1Q. I would say that 2Q and 3Q, we'll probably be sub-4%, and then there is an opportunity in the fourth quarter to get enterprise margins back towards the 4%. You shake all that up on a blended basis, you get the 4.1% which is aligned with our guide today. And then your question specific to DMS, because of the dramatic increase we've had in healthcare and packaging plus the contributions on connected devices, automotive transport, all combined with mobility. If I had to guess today, Ruplu, we just printed in DMS a 5.7% core margin for 1Q. I think that there is a good opportunity for both the second quarter and the third quarter to remain above 4%. And then with investments and things like that, maybe the fourth quarter just shy of 4% something like that.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks. I mean thanks for all the details. Really appreciated. That was very helpful. Maybe I'll ask a different question for my follow-up, which is how do you think about uses of cash, given where we are in the economic cycle? Is it relevant - is it - would it be meaningful for Jabil to look at acquisitions, maybe look at inorganic growth? And how would you prioritize that against buybacks, maintaining the dividend and any debt paydown? So if you can just give us your thoughts on use of cash and your strategy on inorganic growth. And thanks. Thanks so much.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Ruplu. This is a Dastoor question, but let me jump in, because you started with M&A. And then Mike can complement it, if I - if I don't get this all correct. But I think what - I think what Mike did in September, if I remember right, he laid out kind of a - our capital allocation construct. It was a single slide. I don't remember all the details on the slide. We reviewed that and talked about that a bit coming into this call. That structurally hasn't changed. And I think that and I've said this a number of times before, in my opinion, and opinions certainly defer, I think we've been a very reasonable and reasonably friendly to shareholders in terms of our - in terms of our capital allocation strategy where because our belief in the Company and where we are headed, we've been - we've been reasonably aggressive in our buyback since June 2016 which in a few months will be coming up on five years of that type of behavior. I think that will continue for a period of time. When I think about growth, I mentioned earlier Ruplu that right now our organic pipeline, a pipeline that will be at or accretive to margins, is probably $3.5 billion, $4 billion. Again, we'll selectively walk away from some of that, but for sure, organic growth is by far the most optimized growth for shareholders. When we think about M&A, we do - we typically buy four to five companies a year. It's typically around engineering and engineering talent. What we pay for those is more on an asset basis. It doesn't cost us much more, and at times, it's less expensive than just hiring the people. And then - and then, we're always looking at strategic types of things like strategic patents that we like and whatnot. So as we sit today, at least for the - at least for the balance of '21, I don't - I don't think there's going to be any behaviors of big acquisitions for the Company's strategic or otherwise. Mike, you got anything to add?\nMike Dastoor: Yes. From a buyback basis, Ruplu, while we have a $600 million authorization out there, we will continue to be thoughtful, we will continue to be opportunistic. As things start returning to normal, once the vaccine takes hold, we might accelerate some of that purchase that we did in Q1. We're taking it slowly right now, but we'll accelerate that if circumstances warrant.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fox: I had two questions. First of all, on the cloud business, can you - I understand that there is a lot going on that's Jabil specific and it's providing upside. Can you talk about sort of how much of that is reflected in - what you did in the quarter and you're thinking for the rest of the year and also your ability to sort of diversify among service providers? And then secondly, Mark, you've mentioned a couple of times now some of the investments in machine learning and automation. Can you talk about how much of that is sort of table stakes versus maybe creating other areas for you to generate some operating leverage going forward? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Yes. So first part of your question. I don't want to get into - I don't want to get into a lot of details, Steve, on our cloud business. I can say at a high level, we started down this journey two years ago, 2.5 years ago. The service that we provide again is asset-light geocentric. We've been very consistent on that. The adoption and the acceptance of that model by the end market has been very, very good. There is a little indication that that's going to change in the near term. As we said before, I think we - I think we continue - we will continue to invest in that as long as we've got a service and a solution that's well embraced. I think we - we derisk the downside to that business. So again, overall, I - that's all the detail I'd like to provide at the moment because, again, I think, we've got continued momentum in that space. In terms of operational investments, so machine learning, IT, automation, flexible automation, data analytics, etc., I would say 30%, 40% of investments are table stakes where technology is going. And I would say, 50%, 60%, maybe a little more, is differentiation and has to do with, again, if you look at fiscal '16, '17, '18 throughout fiscal year '20 with COVID. But we're talking about uplifting margins on a $27 billion, $28 billion, $29 billion, $30 billion based company, we're talking about uplifting margins by 60 basis points, 70 basis points. We'll see what '22 holds. A material contributor to that is, is the methodology to which we've invested in IT and machine learning and different things to help us optimize our factory floors. I do think what's fact is, is we have 50-plus-million square feet of manufacturing space around the world. We have some of the most incredible systems in terms of supply chain, both of those areas. So, when you think about the core of what we do as a living, we build stuff. The barrier to entry to building stuff is getting higher and higher because of the scale of the investments, the global nature, the risks, etc. And when I think about the two things that are most profound at our core, one is building stuff, two is supply chain. And I would suggest that the investments we continue to make there are differentiated. And one data point on that would be, I don't know of any other company of our scale, in terms of the manufacturing services and solutions world, that has 50 million square feet of manufacturing space connected on a holistic IT system. And I would contend that one example gives us a definitive competitive advantage. And I could go deeper, but I won't on the same thing on supply chain.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Chung: It's Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking our questions. So, your outlook in DMS is seeing raises in every segment. Is this kind of a function of pent-up demand and a more market share gains or expanding business with existing customers or all three? And then, has COVID structurally changed manufacturing strategy from many of your customers? Are they accelerating the shift from in-house to outsourcing?\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think that - I think it's all three. I think that as we look - and I think your question was specific to DMS, although I think part of my answer would be for the whole corporation, inclusive of EMS. But I would say, again, sums market share gains, sums expansion of growth and being side by side with our current customers participating in their growth. So we've got market share gains for sure. We've got growth with our current customers, for sure. And then, again, as I mentioned earlier, this robust organic pipeline, a decent amount of that is brands that we don't currently serve. So I would say the outlook on DMS - again, I think in fiscal '20, our DMS revenue was just a hair over $13 billion. I think this year, it will be a hair over $15 billion and all three of those things would contribute. There was a second part to your question.\nPaul Chung: Yes, just COVID accelerating the shift.\nMark Mondello: Yes. So I - our observation would suggest that, let's say February-March time frame of this year through probably the spring of '21, I actually think COVID has put a halt on most fundamental strategic shifts and decisions by many corporations in terms of what they want to do with their manufacturing structurally. Although my guess is and having participated in some of this, there is lots of discussions, but much like our Mike Dastoor was alluding to, I think a lot of companies have battened down the hatches in terms of preservation of cash. Everybody kind of want to see where COVID goes, does this vaccine work, what's the vaccine distribution look like, what's the timing of the vaccine taking hold, et cetera., et cetera. If there is any good news in what has been a horrific pandemic, it's that as we get to middle of calendar '21, back half of '21 and into '22, I think what has been kind of a discussion points through COVID ends up converting to some actions once people feel like COVID has stabilized or somewhat behind us. So I think that'd be a good thing.\nMike Dastoor: If I can just add, I think more than COVID per se, if you look at the convergence of technology that's been expedited by 5G, some of it is expedited by the work and learn from home environment, which probably extends beyond COVID as well. I think that's driving this big push into technology. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that. I think it's a very long legged sort of approach on that one. And I think we're in the right spaces. Right now, we're in all the right end markets and I think we're seeing the fruits of all of that.\nPaul Chung: And then my follow up is on free cash flow. All your metrics on revenues and op margins have increased, but your free cash flow was reiterated of exceeding $600 million, but I assume the magnitude of the exceed is larger today than it was in 4Q. First, is that kind of a fair assumption? And second, what can swing free cash flow higher as we kind of navigate through fiscal year '21? Any puts and takes you want to call out? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: All right. So we did have - we did see a bit of an increase in revenue that comes with some working capital. We still feel strongly that our free cash flow will be above $600 million. I talked about discipline in CapEx. I think Mark alluded to our working capital discipline. The team is fully engaged, fully focused. So there's a number of levers that we're focused on in that free cash flow bucket, so to speak. And I feel, over time, that just keeps getting more and more attention, that keeps getting higher and higher. So I think right now, we feel good with the $600-plus million. And I think I'd highlight the plus there. And I think the focus that we have continues to bear fruit, again.\nOperator: The next question is from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon Cross: I was just wondering in your conversations with your customers and obviously COVID has played into it, but just in general, how things changed in terms of their desire to onshore or diversify the countries where they manufacture. And I'm just wondering, we obviously have a new administration coming in. Have things shifted at all in terms of the conversation over the year, or do you think people are sort of remain on track thinking that maybe onshoring a bit more, as well as diversifying is the way to go? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Shannon. I think the - I think there's been lots of conversations over the last two, 2.5 years between trade tariff and COVID. I think, and again, lots and lots and lots and lots of discussions. And the one thing is, is when you do what we do, you're in the middle of all those discussions because we are the primary manufacturing partner to so many outstanding customers and brands. But when it comes to actioning on those, I just - I don't think that - I don't think there has been a lot of change. There's - we've talked about this many times over on calls, we've had some customers that have wanted to derisk Mainland China. That's been the exception, not the rule. We've been there for them. One of the benefits you have when - you have a partner like Jabil is we have a really, really optimized footprint all over the world. If I add COVID on top of that, again, lots and lots of discussions. But in the end, I think that the manufacturing and value supply chain ends up following the dollars and following end-market consumption based on a product-by-product basis. And largely, I don't see that changing.\nShannon Cross: And then I'm just curious, during the quarter in terms of linearity, were there any - anything to point out within your segments maybe that improved during the quarter versus weakened toward the end of the quarter? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: No. Actually, this quarter - 1Q had really nice linearity.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Sheerin: Just another question on DMS in the upside to guidance across those sectors, specifically in healthcare. Could you update us on how J&J programs have been ramping? And are you beginning to see that as a contributor to the strong operating margin expansion you've seen year-over-year in that segment?\nMark Mondello: Yes. I won't go too deep into the J&J relationship, specifically JJMD. I'd just say that we've talked about this at a high level, when we first engaged. We kind of laid out a path forward. What's been really nice is, is the path we laid out is the path that we've realized, which is a huge acknowledgment both to J&J and our team. And yes, I think the JJMD relationship is getting to a scale where for sure it's a contributor to our healthcare and packaging business. And through all this, JJMD has been a wonderful partner for us.\nMatt Sheerin: And then on the cloud business, you talked about the strength that you're seeing from customers there and I know you've gone through that transition to a consignment model with the largest customer. Is that largely in the numbers now? And Mike, were there any near-term impact to cash flows because of that transition?\nMike Dastoor: I think it's all part and parcel of our strategy, Matt. We've been working on that for a while. There will be pros and cons to that. I think largely pros, obviously, working capital improves, margins improve. So the consignment piece is strategic in nature. It wasn't something that just happened to us. It's something we've been working on now for a while. And now, over the year, over the coming few quarters, it will hopefully get fully implemented.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Delaney: Thanks very much for taking the questions, and congratulations on the good reports. Mark, thanks for all the comments you made around sustainability and Jabil's efforts there. And I was hoping to just better understand Jabil's ability to offer more environmentally-friendly manufacturing. Can you talk about some of the business implications from that, both in terms of what it may mean for some of the customer relationships and your ability to sustain good market positions? But then to the extent there is any added costs to implement a cleaner manufacturing and clean energy, how does that impact margins and is that something customer pay for or is that more of a shared expense?\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks, Mark. I'd first comment on kind of a macro level and then maybe break it down a bit. I try to express either through these Q&A sessions or more on a prepared remarks basis. The financial results are super important. They are really important to shareholders. But to me, the results themselves are really an output of us taking great care of customers and obsessing around our customers. And along with obsession around our customers that drive these financial results, we also spend, I think, just a tremendous amount of time as a leadership team, talking about approach because results can be derived in many different ways. And when we think about approach inside the Company, one is about an amazing culture that we have, two is about kind of carrying about people and foundational beliefs around diversity and inclusion for all, and then the other one certainly, Mark, is more core to your question, which is around the ESG, social and environmental. I think Jabil, the best thing we can do for our customers, our suppliers, is lead by example. We made a comment - I made a comment in September that said, we're committed to reducing our gas house emissions in - across the Company in the next five to six years by 25%, 30%. And we're on a path to do that. I would suggest that where people get - I think, get confused is, is jeez, that's going to cost us a lot of money. In reality, it's the timing of the costs, but all of that ends up being a net pickup because running the company with lower greenhouse gas emissions, clean energy has a really nice ROI to it. So one, the best thing we can do is lead by example by walking the walk versus just talking about it. We also said in the September call something like we would like to lead our industry, not only in financial returns, but also in approach in terms of ESG, in terms of areas of safety, water usage, hazardous waste. And then the other thing is, Jabil purchases like $20 billion of stuff every year. And we believe we can have a very positive influence on the entire supply chain in terms of leading by example and also kind of mandates that we put on our strategic and key suppliers. And then if I broke that down even further, Mark, Jabil is firmly into renewable value chain. And if I had to guess today, depending on how we characterize that, I would say, we're in the renewable value chain well into the billions of dollars. When I think about what we do for electric vehicles, what we do for wind, what we do for solar, what we do for smart meters, what we do for power efficiency, what we do around energy storage. Another one that we're spending a lot of investment dollars on and attention is sustainable consumer packaging. And then also, when I think about 3D additive and all the investment dollars there, when you think about the additive process, especially with metals and then certainly with polymers, that's also something that squarely an ESG-type category. And then lastly, Mark, we have thousands of engineers and we have a whole subset of engineers that are focused specifically around ESG type of stuff. One example being, we have a dedicated group of engineers around power and power efficiency. So that's kind of how I see how we play in that whole marketplace.\nMark Delaney: And thanks for everything the Company is doing with those efforts. My follow-up question was on financials. And Mike and Mark, you both talked about some more structural savings, you think are going to be sustained around interest expense and tax rates. Is the right way to think about what those levels may mean is to use the guidance for fiscal 2Q and expect to those sorts of level to continue? Or is there a better way for us to be thinking about interest expense and tax rate beyond the second quarter? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Yes. I would sort of estimate interest to be in that $40 million-ish range. I think we delivered about $35 million in Q1. I'd feel better if the estimates going forward are in the $40 million. That's sort of substantially lower than what we thought at the beginning of the quarter. And similarly for tax, I think I'd go with the 26-ish-percent tax rate. Again, that is about 100 basis points lower than we actually indicated at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Adam Berry for closing remarks.\nAdam Berry: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to us. Other than that, please stay safe, but stay healthy. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you.",

            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by offering my sincere gratitude to all of you here at Jabil, and thanks for hanging in there during these trying times, while making safety your number one priority. At Jabil, we're fundamentally in the people business. The manner in which we care for and accept one another is truly what makes us who we are today. And again, thank you. Let's please turn to Slide 5, where we'll look at our results for the first quarter. The quarter came in well ahead of expectations, as the team delivered core operating income of $365 million on record revenue of $7.8 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. The 4.7% margin is a 100 basis point increase year-on-year Q1 2021 to Q1 2020, which as a reminder, was a pre-COVID quarter occurring in September, October and November of 2019. Moreover, I'm really pleased with the financial makeup of the quarter. Well-balanced contributions from our EMS and DMS segments, supplemented with substantial upsides from our cloud computing, connected devices and mobility sectors. Q1 overall gives us excellent momentum to what looks to be another outstanding year. As is customary, Mike will provide more detail around our Q1 results during his prepared remarks. Moving to Slide 6, you'll see a terrific illustration, which underscores the effectiveness of our team. When I look at the slide, what gets me most enthused is the fact that we get one plus one equals three in so many ways across our two business segments. One example of this are the financial goals and objectives for each segment. Our DMS segment focuses on expanding margins, while offering reliable cash flows, while our EMS segment focuses on expanding cash flows while offering reliable margins, perfect complements that fortify our financial results. These two segments placed side-by-side underpin our resiliency, especially when an individual product or product family is faced with the macro disruption, cyclical demand or unforeseen market dynamics. Speaking of a macro disruption, today, more than ever, I look at Jabil as an essential business and a trusted partner. Essential and trusted in a sustainable sense, knowing that Jabil is a primary manufacturing partner that supports a few trillion dollars of market value. Day in and day out, we deliver high-quality products while solving and simplifying complex challenges for the customers we so humbly serve. Add to this, the collaboration embedded in our model, plus the deep domain expertise and a longstanding culture of always doing what's right. It's a proven formula which stimulates progress. And since we're on the topic of progress, let's turn to Slide 7, where we see management's outlook for the year. Not only is the Company well positioned to exceed our financial goals around margins for the year, but we're now predicting core earnings per share will be in the range of $4.60, up 15% compared to 90 days ago and up 55% to 60% when compared to fiscal year 2020. This meaningful increase to earnings is largely driven by two catalysts. The first being our well-diversified commercial portfolio, which gives us a firm and steady foundation on which to operate our business. And the second being the reduction of our net interest expense, driven by proactive steps we've taken over the past nine months to 12 months. I'd like to offer another round of thanks to our employees. Your stamina and collective efforts in placing the needs of the customer first has enabled an additional $1 billion of revenue for the year. Wonderful mix of revenue and leverage allowing us the opportunity to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.1% for the year. A clear reflection of our actions, specifically when it comes to margin expansion and growth of earnings. Furthermore, we will give continued attention to core areas of differentiation and investment. Areas like our homogenous IT framework, factory automation and machine learning, back office data analytics and specialized supply chain tools, all in the name of greater efficiencies and performance. In closing this morning, I do want to share a thought that encompasses our team. Delivering for shareholders and serving our customers is a must, but we'll only do so by respecting our environmental and social responsibilities, while also safeguarding Jabil's workplace to ensure every Jabil employee can be their true self with acceptance of individual differences. With that, please keep safe and I wish all of you a peaceful holiday. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. I don't know that I look at a timeframe change. I mean, we - in September, we talked about the full-year at $4. So, we felt compelled to address the $4 or a change to it. So I don't think anything has changed in terms of confidence of the business relative to September. If I break the answer up into a couple of things: one, we - we've been on the six, seven-year journey, where we've really focused - we focused a number of years on driving the top line, because our strategic belief in a business like us when we're a service business, the more diversified we become, the more resilient, the more predictable, the better the Company is. And so, it was all hands on deck. And what's interesting, Adam, about that is the proof is in the pudding. One could say, geez, you guys chased a lot of growth. That's true, but we went through a period of time from fiscal 2016 to - I think even fiscal 2019, maybe fiscal 2015 to 2019. We're through a lot of the period of time when we were diversifying the margins of the corporation at an enterprise level were around 3.5%. And I would contend that we must have done a pretty good job of the diversification, not only diversifying the different end markets, but the quality of - the quality of revenue we brought into the Company, which has allowed us largely to come into this year and offer $4 a share. The second part of your question in terms of the $4.60. I think what I just said gives us confidence in the $4.60. We had a midpoint of $1.25 for 1Q. We delivered a $1.60. So you take a look at the spread on that to start the year and that spread going from the $1.25 to a $1.60 was really broken down I think into three parts. One was there is a few areas of our business that we saw very strong demand. Number two is just the overall construct of the portfolio. Number three is Dastoor, Sergio and our finance team have done a wonderful job over the last six, nine months or so working the balance sheet. And so, we're starting to see some foundational positive changes to interest expense. So you shake that up to start the year, and then we - I think with our 2Q guide, I don't know consensus was around high-80s and I think our midpoint is $0.92, $0.93. So we took Q2 up a $0.05. And that, we're in the middle of 2Q now, so we got reasonable visibility to that. And then as we look at the back half of the year, Adam, if I just think about revenue, so back in September, we started the year would be about $26.5 billion, maybe $27 billion. Now it's looking more or like $27.5 billion. About $800 million, $900 million of that is in the front half. $100 million to $200 million is in the back half, which I think addresses your point in terms of - it's a reasonable blend throughout the year. And again, when I think about - when I think about the $0.60 delta, I think, about a combination of again the strong portfolio. And then, I also think about the foundational change to interest and tax, probably leaning more towards interest and tax, I would say, of the - going from $4 to $4.60. $0.25 to $0.30 is kind of foundational interest in tax, which is I think a huge positive. And then the balance of that would be the portfolio itself. Something else I think is worth noting. We thought long and hard on how do we - we felt compelled to update the year, right? And because we started with a look to the year in September. So, we thought long and hard on how conservative do we want to be and we just kind of laid out the numbers and we went over this multiple times. And to us, $4.60 feels like a good number. But I think what's really, really important for this call is to suggest that as a leadership team, that $4.60 and the 4.1% that we - that we've now put out there is our outlook for the year. I think a very important element of that is the $4.60 and the 4.1% are now kind of foundational for us to build off of for fiscal 2022. So I think that's - I don't think that point should be lost. Adam, if I could comment on something that I think you hit on that. I also think I wouldn't want loss, because there is a lot of numbers - good numbers on this call. And as we were growing the business and focusing on diversification, and I would now contend we're well diversified. So it's a journey, but I think the Company is very well diversified at the moment, again, result of a lot of hard work and effort. But two things happen when you're in that type of mode. Number one is we got a little bit fluffy in terms of headcount and overhead and we dealt with a lot of that this past summer. That's coming through in the results. Number two is the working capital management. And the working capital management, I've seen out of our team in the last six to nine months has been absolutely fabulous. And I think the fact that we're looking, our outlook reflects another $1 billion of revenue for the year and we're still keeping cash flows north of $600 million speaks volumes of that in terms of us being very, very intentional on working capital and working capital management. Yes. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Jim. I'll try it in a couple of different ways. One is, as Mike said, I think it's - I think a good proxy for modeling going forward is CapEx to be about 3 points of revenue, plus or minus. Some quarters, it will be less. Some quarters, it will be more. Here's what we can I think assure you on. If CapEx goes up a bit, actually look at that as a good thing because with the disciplines we've put in, with the company being well-diversified, the pipeline that we have today on an organic basis, it's probably about $3.5 billion, $4 billion of topline, which by the way we absolutely will intentionally walk away from some of that. So the kind of the purposeful nature of bringing additional topline into the Company I think is as high as it's ever been. If CapEx were to go up to 3.1% or 3.2% or something like that, again, you can be rest assured that that's going to be accretive both the cash flows and margins going forward and by the way in a relatively short-term basis in terms of bringing the business on. So - but that's kind of one. Number 2 is getting back to your question specifically around factories. What our operational people have done? And we - the genesis of what we do for living is we build stuff. We have - everybody is important. Our finance group is important, HR is important, commercial - but our operational people are at the very core of what we do, Jim. And what they've done in terms of navigating COVID, keeping our factories up and running. I said something in my prepared remarks around the fact that COVID has proven to us to be an essential business, but I think of essential two ways. One is, essential around COVID, but on a more sustainable basis. We're an essential business because when you sit back and think about our size and scale today and the fact that we kind of build a little bit of everything, we really do - we really do help support and partner to a few trillion dollars of market cap. And what our operational team did, getting back to your question around factory utilization and efficiencies through COVID, was miraculous. And by the way, we did that with a de minimis amount of COVID cases. And by the way, I want to be careful with that statement, because those were COVID did impact them was very binary. But when I think about back to utilization through this pandemic, a huge shout out to our operational teams. As I look forward, Jim, for the balance of the year, our factories are running at what I would - what I would call very normalized utilization rates. And there is - there is nothing there that gives me pause that says the CapEx is going to have to go to 4% or 4.5% of revenue, because there's going to be some big step function in terms of additional capacity. And the last - the last thing I'd like to comment relative to your question is, is we've also been talking for the last three, four or five years on the OpEx investments that we're making, which our OpEx investments are probably $100 million a year. And that's kind of what I would call progressive IT, factory of the future, machine learning, data automation, much of which affects our factory floors in terms of productivity and efficiencies. So, I think it's a combination of all of that stuff. I'll give you a two-part answer to that. Number 1, I'll give that's a great - that's a great opening for me to give a shout out to our supply chain folks. If you - as you do, Jim, you know us around the industry, we have - I think we have fundamentally one of the most respected supply chain global teams in the world and they do a fabulous job for us when markets get tight and otherwise. With that being said, of the 100 or 200 things that Dastoor and I worry about day in and day out with our team, as we sit today, supply shortages is one of them. Okay, Ruplu. If I don't give you a complete answer, shout back at me because there was quite a bit there and I was kind of thinking through it, as you were talking. I think - I don't know what order I'll get this in, but let me try a couple of things. I think - I think foundationally, fundamentally, however you want to look at it, the thing - we talked a lot about diversification. And I know your question was largely around DMS, but if I could, for a moment. The most amazing thing today about the construct of the Company is - is if you extrapolate out the numbers that we've given today, you could - DMS will be in the range of about $15 billion for the year topline. EMS will be in the range of about $12.5 billion topline. That's with the new model on our cloud services business. And then you look at these complementary segments, Ruplu, DMS today - and again, this isn't hard and fast guidepost, but it's directionally how we think about the business and behave. Our DMS segment, so the $15 billion is the way to think about that is, it's about expanding margins and ensuring good reliable cash flows. The complement to that on the EMS side, which is a $12.5 billion, is really about expanding cash flows, while being sure that they focus on reliable margins. And those complements, as I said in my prepared notes, is I really think we get one plus one equals three. More specific to your question, when I think about kind of the year overall, I - Q1, we saw some - we saw - in Q1, we saw strength across the entire business other than maybe two or three pockets. So say out of - out of 10 to 12 pockets of business, let's say, two, three, four were neutral to slightly down, but it was just one of these quarters where everything kind of - everything kind of connected, whether it be mobility, connected devices, cloud, automotive transport, healthcare packaging, semicap, even network and storage. So - and then pockets of industrial as well. And again, it's just another illustration of the real promise of being diversified. As I think about the year going forward, I would think we'll continue to see reasonable strength across most - all of those end markets unless there is a big macro disruption and we'll see what happens today with the - or this week with the stimulus plan, but - and again, I think that - that leads us to why we have a degree of confidence in the $4.60. And then, there was another part of your question, I believe Ruplu specific to our mobility sector. In terms of shape of the year for the Company, I would say - I would say, we just printed a 4.7% margin in 1Q. I would say that 2Q and 3Q, we'll probably be sub-4%, and then there is an opportunity in the fourth quarter to get enterprise margins back towards the 4%. You shake all that up on a blended basis, you get the 4.1% which is aligned with our guide today. And then your question specific to DMS, because of the dramatic increase we've had in healthcare and packaging plus the contributions on connected devices, automotive transport, all combined with mobility. If I had to guess today, Ruplu, we just printed in DMS a 5.7% core margin for 1Q. I think that there is a good opportunity for both the second quarter and the third quarter to remain above 4%. And then with investments and things like that, maybe the fourth quarter just shy of 4% something like that. Yes. Thanks, Ruplu. This is a Dastoor question, but let me jump in, because you started with M&A. And then Mike can complement it, if I - if I don't get this all correct. But I think what - I think what Mike did in September, if I remember right, he laid out kind of a - our capital allocation construct. It was a single slide. I don't remember all the details on the slide. We reviewed that and talked about that a bit coming into this call. That structurally hasn't changed. And I think that and I've said this a number of times before, in my opinion, and opinions certainly defer, I think we've been a very reasonable and reasonably friendly to shareholders in terms of our - in terms of our capital allocation strategy where because our belief in the Company and where we are headed, we've been - we've been reasonably aggressive in our buyback since June 2016 which in a few months will be coming up on five years of that type of behavior. I think that will continue for a period of time. When I think about growth, I mentioned earlier Ruplu that right now our organic pipeline, a pipeline that will be at or accretive to margins, is probably $3.5 billion, $4 billion. Again, we'll selectively walk away from some of that, but for sure, organic growth is by far the most optimized growth for shareholders. When we think about M&A, we do - we typically buy four to five companies a year. It's typically around engineering and engineering talent. What we pay for those is more on an asset basis. It doesn't cost us much more, and at times, it's less expensive than just hiring the people. And then - and then, we're always looking at strategic types of things like strategic patents that we like and whatnot. So as we sit today, at least for the - at least for the balance of '21, I don't - I don't think there's going to be any behaviors of big acquisitions for the Company's strategic or otherwise. Mike, you got anything to add? Yes. So first part of your question. I don't want to get into - I don't want to get into a lot of details, Steve, on our cloud business. I can say at a high level, we started down this journey two years ago, 2.5 years ago. The service that we provide again is asset-light geocentric. We've been very consistent on that. The adoption and the acceptance of that model by the end market has been very, very good. There is a little indication that that's going to change in the near term. As we said before, I think we - I think we continue - we will continue to invest in that as long as we've got a service and a solution that's well embraced. I think we - we derisk the downside to that business. So again, overall, I - that's all the detail I'd like to provide at the moment because, again, I think, we've got continued momentum in that space. In terms of operational investments, so machine learning, IT, automation, flexible automation, data analytics, etc., I would say 30%, 40% of investments are table stakes where technology is going. And I would say, 50%, 60%, maybe a little more, is differentiation and has to do with, again, if you look at fiscal '16, '17, '18 throughout fiscal year '20 with COVID. But we're talking about uplifting margins on a $27 billion, $28 billion, $29 billion, $30 billion based company, we're talking about uplifting margins by 60 basis points, 70 basis points. We'll see what '22 holds. A material contributor to that is, is the methodology to which we've invested in IT and machine learning and different things to help us optimize our factory floors. I do think what's fact is, is we have 50-plus-million square feet of manufacturing space around the world. We have some of the most incredible systems in terms of supply chain, both of those areas. So, when you think about the core of what we do as a living, we build stuff. The barrier to entry to building stuff is getting higher and higher because of the scale of the investments, the global nature, the risks, etc. And when I think about the two things that are most profound at our core, one is building stuff, two is supply chain. And I would suggest that the investments we continue to make there are differentiated. And one data point on that would be, I don't know of any other company of our scale, in terms of the manufacturing services and solutions world, that has 50 million square feet of manufacturing space connected on a holistic IT system. And I would contend that one example gives us a definitive competitive advantage. And I could go deeper, but I won't on the same thing on supply chain. Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think that - I think it's all three. I think that as we look - and I think your question was specific to DMS, although I think part of my answer would be for the whole corporation, inclusive of EMS. But I would say, again, sums market share gains, sums expansion of growth and being side by side with our current customers participating in their growth. So we've got market share gains for sure. We've got growth with our current customers, for sure. And then, again, as I mentioned earlier, this robust organic pipeline, a decent amount of that is brands that we don't currently serve. So I would say the outlook on DMS - again, I think in fiscal '20, our DMS revenue was just a hair over $13 billion. I think this year, it will be a hair over $15 billion and all three of those things would contribute. There was a second part to your question. Yes. So I - our observation would suggest that, let's say February-March time frame of this year through probably the spring of '21, I actually think COVID has put a halt on most fundamental strategic shifts and decisions by many corporations in terms of what they want to do with their manufacturing structurally. Although my guess is and having participated in some of this, there is lots of discussions, but much like our Mike Dastoor was alluding to, I think a lot of companies have battened down the hatches in terms of preservation of cash. Everybody kind of want to see where COVID goes, does this vaccine work, what's the vaccine distribution look like, what's the timing of the vaccine taking hold, et cetera., et cetera. If there is any good news in what has been a horrific pandemic, it's that as we get to middle of calendar '21, back half of '21 and into '22, I think what has been kind of a discussion points through COVID ends up converting to some actions once people feel like COVID has stabilized or somewhat behind us. So I think that'd be a good thing. Thanks, Shannon. I think the - I think there's been lots of conversations over the last two, 2.5 years between trade tariff and COVID. I think, and again, lots and lots and lots and lots of discussions. And the one thing is, is when you do what we do, you're in the middle of all those discussions because we are the primary manufacturing partner to so many outstanding customers and brands. But when it comes to actioning on those, I just - I don't think that - I don't think there has been a lot of change. There's - we've talked about this many times over on calls, we've had some customers that have wanted to derisk Mainland China. That's been the exception, not the rule. We've been there for them. One of the benefits you have when - you have a partner like Jabil is we have a really, really optimized footprint all over the world. If I add COVID on top of that, again, lots and lots of discussions. But in the end, I think that the manufacturing and value supply chain ends up following the dollars and following end-market consumption based on a product-by-product basis. And largely, I don't see that changing. No. Actually, this quarter - 1Q had really nice linearity. Yes. I won't go too deep into the J&J relationship, specifically JJMD. I'd just say that we've talked about this at a high level, when we first engaged. We kind of laid out a path forward. What's been really nice is, is the path we laid out is the path that we've realized, which is a huge acknowledgment both to J&J and our team. And yes, I think the JJMD relationship is getting to a scale where for sure it's a contributor to our healthcare and packaging business. And through all this, JJMD has been a wonderful partner for us. Yes. Thanks, Mark. I'd first comment on kind of a macro level and then maybe break it down a bit. I try to express either through these Q&A sessions or more on a prepared remarks basis. The financial results are super important. They are really important to shareholders. But to me, the results themselves are really an output of us taking great care of customers and obsessing around our customers. And along with obsession around our customers that drive these financial results, we also spend, I think, just a tremendous amount of time as a leadership team, talking about approach because results can be derived in many different ways. And when we think about approach inside the Company, one is about an amazing culture that we have, two is about kind of carrying about people and foundational beliefs around diversity and inclusion for all, and then the other one certainly, Mark, is more core to your question, which is around the ESG, social and environmental. I think Jabil, the best thing we can do for our customers, our suppliers, is lead by example. We made a comment - I made a comment in September that said, we're committed to reducing our gas house emissions in - across the Company in the next five to six years by 25%, 30%. And we're on a path to do that. I would suggest that where people get - I think, get confused is, is jeez, that's going to cost us a lot of money. In reality, it's the timing of the costs, but all of that ends up being a net pickup because running the company with lower greenhouse gas emissions, clean energy has a really nice ROI to it. So one, the best thing we can do is lead by example by walking the walk versus just talking about it. We also said in the September call something like we would like to lead our industry, not only in financial returns, but also in approach in terms of ESG, in terms of areas of safety, water usage, hazardous waste. And then the other thing is, Jabil purchases like $20 billion of stuff every year. And we believe we can have a very positive influence on the entire supply chain in terms of leading by example and also kind of mandates that we put on our strategic and key suppliers. And then if I broke that down even further, Mark, Jabil is firmly into renewable value chain. And if I had to guess today, depending on how we characterize that, I would say, we're in the renewable value chain well into the billions of dollars. When I think about what we do for electric vehicles, what we do for wind, what we do for solar, what we do for smart meters, what we do for power efficiency, what we do around energy storage. Another one that we're spending a lot of investment dollars on and attention is sustainable consumer packaging. And then also, when I think about 3D additive and all the investment dollars there, when you think about the additive process, especially with metals and then certainly with polymers, that's also something that squarely an ESG-type category. And then lastly, Mark, we have thousands of engineers and we have a whole subset of engineers that are focused specifically around ESG type of stuff. One example being, we have a dedicated group of engineers around power and power efficiency. So that's kind of how I see how we play in that whole marketplace."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Q1 was an exceptional quarter. The team delivered record results on three fronts: revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share. We saw broad-based strength across both segments, which allowed us to deliver financial results that came in above what we expected in September. Our overperformance in the quarter was largely driven by three factors. For starters, our multi-year journey to both diversify and reposition the Company continues to pay dividends. During the quarter, our healthcare, automotive and semi-cap businesses all performed at or near the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Consequently, these results alone would have put us near the top end of our guidance range for Q1. On top of this, during the quarter, a few of our highly regarded strategic customers in our mobility, connected devices and cloud businesses experienced unexpected high levels of demand in Q1, which caused revenue to come in much higher than expected. Clearly, our value proposition across key end markets continues to resonate with customers as a result of our unique set of capabilities in design, engineering and global supply chain and manufacturing. And then finally, our interest and tax expense came in better than expected. The proactive steps we've taken over the last few quarters to bolster our balance sheet afforded us the flexibility to efficiently access the debt capital markets, thereby reducing net interest expense during the quarter. The compounding effects of higher-than-expected revenue and the associated leverage, along with lower interest and tax expense, allowed us to deliver record revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in Q1. With that, I will now review our Q1 financial results. Net revenue for the first quarter was $7.8 billion, $800 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by $300 million or 4% despite our strategic shift to a consignment model within our cloud business. GAAP operating income was $314 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.31. Core operating income during the quarter was $365 million, an increase of 32% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%, a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. I am particularly pleased with solid operating leverage as a result of our optimized cost structure and strong demand. As I mentioned a moment ago, our net interest expense came in better than expected at $34.4 million, approximately $13 million better than expected and our core tax rate was also better than expected at 25.7%. Core diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.60, a 52% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our first quarter segment results. Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.2 billion, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned earlier, the strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broad-based. Core margins for the segment improved 70 basis points over the prior year to 5.7%. It's worth noting, during Q1, we saw an abrupt and unanticipated intra-quarter strengthening of the renminbi versus the U.S. dollar, which weighed on our DMS core margins by an estimated 50 basis points. Nonetheless, an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment also came in strong at $3.6 billion, reflecting robust demand in semicap, digital print and cloud. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 3.4%, 100 basis points higher than the previous year and well above expectations. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q1, inventory days came in better than expected at 55 days. Cash flows provided by operations was $65 million in Q1 and net capital expenditures totaled $242 million. We exited the quarter with cash balances of $1.1 billion. We ended Q1 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity along with our quarter-end cash balance, Jabil ended Q1 with access to more than $4.9 billion of available liquidity, which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares for $50 million. Turning now to our second quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 22% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 billion. This is mainly due to strong end-market outlook and a favorable year-over-year comparison. EMS segment revenue is expected to be $3 billion, a decrease of 8% on a year-over-year basis, reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total Company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '21 to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion for an increase of 6% on a year-over-year basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $210 million to $260 million with core operating margin in the range of 3.4% to 3.8%. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $0.83 to $1.03. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.82. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Over the last several quarters, we repositioned our business to serve critical and long life cycle products, while also providing the foundation for predictable yet strong cash flows and margins. As part of this journey, we've reshaped and will continue to reshape the portfolio, further improving the mix of our business. Our DMS business is in incredibly good shape today, headlined by nearly $5 billion healthcare and packaging business which serves many of the most critical healthcare, medical device and consumer packaged goods companies in the world. The convergence of technology in our daily lives expedited by 5G and remote work and learn environments continues to drive our mobility and connected devices business. With over 50 years of experience serving the automotive industry, including a 10-year partnership with the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, we are well-positioned for continued growth. Jabil has made an intentional and early shift towards supporting technologies that enable autonomous, connected and electrified vehicles. Our investments and expertise in these areas have allowed us to capture new business with some of the world's leading OEMs and Tier 1s. In EMS, we participate in the design, product development, industrialization and manufacturing with some of the most sophisticated tech products in the marketplace today. Supporting these markets requires an ability to manage large, complex material supply chains with sophisticated IT systems that enable us to manage change and mitigate potential risk to our customers' supply chain at a rapid pace. Today, our EMS business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide us with confidence in future earnings and cash flow generation. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the robust start to the year. For the year, we now anticipate revenues will be up roughly $1 billion from prior guidance and core operating margin has increased 10 basis points to 4.1%. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of $4.60 for the year. And importantly, despite the stronger-than-expected growth and associated working capital, we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $600 million for the year. We've been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins, cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts. I would like to wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam. Adam. That's a good question. I think we've been - I'm extremely pleased with the discipline that we're showing on the CapEx front. The entire team is being extremely thoughtful about CapEx. And we're pushing back on customers where we feel that the CapEx is not warranted. So good discipline, Adam. I would sort of think of CapEx at a 3 percent-ish rate on revenue. I think we've been 2.9%, we've been 3.1%. We've been 3% in the last four, five years, but I think a 3% sounds like a good sort of gauge for CapEx going forward. Yes. From a buyback basis, Ruplu, while we have a $600 million authorization out there, we will continue to be thoughtful, we will continue to be opportunistic. As things start returning to normal, once the vaccine takes hold, we might accelerate some of that purchase that we did in Q1. We're taking it slowly right now, but we'll accelerate that if circumstances warrant. If I can just add, I think more than COVID per se, if you look at the convergence of technology that's been expedited by 5G, some of it is expedited by the work and learn from home environment, which probably extends beyond COVID as well. I think that's driving this big push into technology. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that. I think it's a very long legged sort of approach on that one. And I think we're in the right spaces. Right now, we're in all the right end markets and I think we're seeing the fruits of all of that. All right. So we did have - we did see a bit of an increase in revenue that comes with some working capital. We still feel strongly that our free cash flow will be above $600 million. I talked about discipline in CapEx. I think Mark alluded to our working capital discipline. The team is fully engaged, fully focused. So there's a number of levers that we're focused on in that free cash flow bucket, so to speak. And I feel, over time, that just keeps getting more and more attention, that keeps getting higher and higher. So I think right now, we feel good with the $600-plus million. And I think I'd highlight the plus there. And I think the focus that we have continues to bear fruit, again. I think it's all part and parcel of our strategy, Matt. We've been working on that for a while. There will be pros and cons to that. I think largely pros, obviously, working capital improves, margins improve. So the consignment piece is strategic in nature. It wasn't something that just happened to us. It's something we've been working on now for a while. And now, over the year, over the coming few quarters, it will hopefully get fully implemented. Yes. I would sort of estimate interest to be in that $40 million-ish range. I think we delivered about $35 million in Q1. I'd feel better if the estimates going forward are in the $40 million. That's sort of substantially lower than what we thought at the beginning of the quarter. And similarly for tax, I think I'd go with the 26-ish-percent tax rate. Again, that is about 100 basis points lower than we actually indicated at the beginning of the year."

        "content": "Adam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil\u2019s Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call and Fifth Annual Investor Briefing. My name is Adam Berry. I am Head of Investor Relations at Jabil. And I represent a team here that\u2019s pretty excited to share our 2022 results with you today while also providing additional detail around our focus and outlook as typical for our September call. In terms of agenda over the next 60 minutes or so, we aim to accomplish the following: discuss the trends underway within the end markets we serve, review our fourth quarter and fiscal year \u201822 results, provide first quarter guidance, offer our fiscal \u201823 outlook that includes enterprise level growth while also remaining sensible and grounded given the realities of the dynamic global macro environment surrounding us today. And finally, we will refresh our capital allocation and shareholder return policies. And most importantly, as our session unfolds, I hope that we are able to provide you with further perspective on Jabil, which I believe is uniquely positioned to grow and win in environment where supply chain and global manufacturing capabilities have never been so important. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Mike Dastoor, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Mondello, our Chairman and CEO, who together account for over 50 years of Jabil experience. And importantly, when you think about their respective tenures, you can\u2019t help but also think about how they have guided Jabil through periods of economic expansion and times where macro conditions were a bit more challenged, a tenure that gives me great confidence as we move into fiscal \u201823. So with that, there is just one more housekeeping item before we begin. Please note the following. During today\u2019s presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected first quarter and fiscal year net revenue, earnings and cash flow. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As you can see on Slide 4, Jabil has vastly improved since we began these investor briefing sessions in 2018. Today, Jabil is a $33.5 billion enterprise with over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space across 100-plus sites. Our cash flow generation is strong, allowing us to invest in key end market growth, while also returning considerable cash to shareholders, which in fiscal \u201822 was $744 million. And our roughly 260,000 people move with purpose and agility to meet customer needs within a wide-ranging composition of the end markets you see here. Moving to our next slide, you can\u2019t help but notice the global nature of our manufacturing footprint, which enables us to manufacture on a local level for a global set of customers. No matter whether its mobility products in Asia, healthcare products in North America or 5G infrastructure in Europe, we work with our customers to design and develop the most impactful manufacturing solutions irrespective of region with a focus on speed and urgency and a crisp sense of consistency from plant to plant. This is critical, because in today\u2019s geopolitical climate, the ability to adjust and move with urgency has never been more important as we help customers react to changes in tariffs, the rise of pandemics and natural disasters, energy shortages, conflict and many other unforeseen events. The Jabil of 2022 is also diversified and robust, thereby allowing us to meet challenges head on in one part of the business, while outperforming in others. So just exactly how did we get here? Well, I am here to tell you, it was very purposeful. In the 2016 timeframe, our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably. This important characteristic was diversification. So beginning in roughly 2017, we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5G, cloud, healthcare, packaging, connected devices, semi capital equipment and electric vehicles. Our intentional and deliberate focus on these emerging end markets, combined with our already robust traditional businesses in print and retail, networking and storage and mobility, resulted in considerable enterprise level growth over the past 4 to 5 years as you can see here. And as a result, today, no product or product family represents more than 5% of our business, creating an added level of comfort as demand fluctuates up and down, global tastes change and technology constantly evolves. Given our intentional focus on diversification, over the next couple of minutes, I\u2019d like to take a moment and review some of the end markets that have fueled our growth leading to the portfolio mix you see today. In automotive, we are supporting a rapid shift in technology to electric vehicles as evidenced by our 121% revenue growth since fiscal \u201818. The growth has been driven by our best-in-class portfolio of customers in an addressable market that is growing by the day. In EV, our manufacturing processes support the industrialization and production of complex technology for electric vehicles, including battery management systems, inverters, converters, cables, off-board and onboard charging. And importantly, all of this increased complexity translates to increased content per vehicle for Jabil. Since fiscal \u201818, our 5G wireless and cloud business has nearly tripled in spite of the asset-light nature of the cloud model as our Design-to-Dust value proposition resonates with existing and new customers. From secure supply chain design and manufacturing to rack integration and ultimately recycling, Jabil is winning in an expanding market. In healthcare, our business has doubled since fiscal \u201818 as the industry is experiencing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations and the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets. To address these trends, doctors, hospitals and patients are adopting new and more innovative ways to deliver better, more personalized treatment. Consequently, healthcare OEMs are partnering with Jabil to navigate these changes. Today, we support customers in the development of solutions across medical devices, diagnostics, pharmaceutical delivery and orthopedics. From rapid prototyping using additive manufacturing to high volume production, tooling, injection molding, robotics and rigorous test procedures for regulatory compliance, Jabil healthcare offers an unmatched suite of capabilities, all of which uniquely positions us to offer technology-enabled solution to our customers. In industrial and semi cap, our business has grown 43% since fiscal \u201818 driven mainly by the increasing need for green energy and with incredibly strong global demand for semiconductors. Within our industrial business, alternative energy generation and consumption are driving increased need for power conversion, power optimization, line balancing and storage at the endpoints of generation and consumption, including accelerated adoption of EVs as well as on the grid. Jabil has been investing in this space with reference designs and scaled manufacturing partnerships globally. On the semi cap side of our business, semiconductor equipment has become increasingly complex and precise, driving new generations of equipment at large scale. And when you take a step back, you will again notice an incredibly well diverse set of business sectors in support of some of the largest, most innovative and successful brands in the world today. In each of these end markets, we are incredibly focused on delivering consistent and reliable value from early in the product lifecycle like product innovation and design to more mature products where we offer planning, automation, supply chain management and of course, manufacturing. At the end of the day, we build stuff here at Jabil and we do it really, really well. In summary, so far today, I have discussed the benefits of our global footprint, our focused and intentional growth in key end markets and the high level of consistency brought forth through diversification. Before turning the call over to Mike, I\u2019ll try to tie this together through the use of real-life examples within the business to demonstrate the importance of diversification while also walking through our Q4 results. For the quarter, revenue was approximately $9 billion, ahead of our forecast, driven by much better than expected revenue in 5G wireless and cloud and networking and storage as our ability to secure critical parts on higher end demand created meaningful revenue upside during the quarter. At the same time, healthcare and packaging, connected devices, mobility, digital print and retail and industrial and semi cap all performed really well and consistent to our expectations. All of this growth was slightly offset by component shortages in automotive where supply chain challenges remain the most pronounced. Altogether, at the enterprise level, revenue grew by 22% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, reflecting continued strong demand. In Q4, our GAAP operating income was $409 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.25. Core operating income during the quarter was $447 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 5%, up 80 basis points over the prior year driven by the aforementioned strength in certain end markets, slightly offset by unanticipated costs associated with the power shortages in Chengdu during the month of August. Net interest expense in the quarter came in higher than expectations at $53 million primarily associated with rising interest rates, while our tax rate came in better than expected by approximately 70 basis points, resulting in core diluted earnings per share of $2.34, a 63% improvement over the prior year quarter and at the higher end of our range. Revenue for the DMS segment was $4.4 billion, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis, while core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.1%, slightly lower due to the temporary power shutdowns in China. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.6 billion, an increase of 32% on a year-over-year basis and well ahead of our plan from June. Core margin for the segment was 4.8%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting good operating leverage on strong growth. I believe the fourth quarter is the perfect illustration of our global network of factories adjusting, adapting and ultimately delivering for our customers and shareholders alike. It feels as though the days of single end markets creating outsized issues for the company seem well off in the rearview mirror. And if you are buying Jabil today, it\u2019s not for a single product, but rather a tenured leadership team, strong manufacturing capabilities and the general assumption that technology is converging with our day-to-day lives. Thanks for your time today. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. Our business model has been intentionally structured with the aim of delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth and strong predictable cash flows. On top of this, our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility. This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end market portfolio over the last several years, which has performed extremely well evidenced by a very strong FY \u201822 results. I am extremely pleased with the resiliency of our business, particularly considering the numerous challenges throughout the year with ongoing COVID waves, war in the Ukraine, global inflation, supply chain challenges and multiple energy shortages. Despite these challenges, we delivered year-on-year growth in revenue of 14%, core operating income of 24%, and core EPS of 36%, all while increasing core operating margin by 40 basis points over FY \u201821. At a segment level for the year, our DMS revenue was $16.7 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up 12% year-over-year. This resulted in core margin expanding 10 basis points to 4.9%. In EMS for the year, core operating income growth was incredibly strong, up 43% over the prior year. This resulted in core margin expanding an impressive 60 basis points over \u201821 on revenue of $16.7 billion. The strength in our EMS margins is reflective of our improving mix and strong leverage on 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In FY \u201822, fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $1.65 billion. For the quarter, inventory days came in at 79, down 6 days sequentially on improved working capital management by the team. It\u2019s worth noting that we offset a portion of our higher inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers, which reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of inventory deposits, inventory days was 62 in Q4, down 8 days from Q3. While I am pleased with the sequential decline in inventory days, the team continues to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY \u201823 as some of the supply chain constraints continue to ease. Net capital expenditures for the fiscal year were $841 million or 2.5% of net revenue. As a result of the strong Q4 cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $810 million. And finally, we exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x and cash balances of $1.5 billion. Next, I would like to provide some clarity on our CapEx as shown in our cash flow statement. As a reminder, our customers routinely co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then later reimbursed to us by customers. Due to the high dollar value, these co-investments from our customers and how they are reflected on our cash flow statement, it is important that the two line items shown on the slide to reflect the true CapEx number and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. Our net capital expenditures for the fiscal year amounted to $841 million. Moving now to our capital returns to shareholders on the next slide. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY \u201822 to 11.8 million shares or $696 million. To-date, we have utilized $737 million of our $1 billion authorization granted in July of last year. This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY \u201813 to approximately 102 million shares at an average price of $30, bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.6 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. In summary, I am extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the sustainable momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal \u201822. Moving to the next slide, where I will offer some insight about how we are thinking about the business this year by end market. Across most of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient, particularly in end markets that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds, many of which Adam highlighted a moment ago. We continue to expect these secular markets to expand in FY \u201823. We also expect some consumer-centric end markets to underperform compared to the robust growth for the past 18 months. Unlike in past economic slowdowns where Jabil was highly concentrated in a particular product or end market, today, it is critical to think of Jabil not as one company, but as a well-diversified accumulation of many end markets, a number of which we expect will continue to benefit from long-term secular tailwinds. This product and end market diversification, coupled with our global network of connected factories, global best-in-class supply chain management and deep domain expertise, makes Jabil today markedly more resilient than we were 5 to 10 years ago as evidenced by our strong results in the last few years in the face of multiple significant global challenges. Our FY \u201823 guidance assumes a moderate economic slowdown and some moderation in growth, which will impact certain end markets more than others. I would now like to walk you through each end market and describe how we are thinking about our business in the coming year. In our automotive and transportation end market, we expect the global transition to EVs to continue to drive robust growth within our automotive business despite choppy overall demand in global automotive purchases. Our view is that EV adoption will continue to accelerate and gain a larger share of the auto market in FY \u201823 regardless of the near-term global growth dynamics. Jabil\u2019s content per vehicle, which can be as high as $3,000 or more for a fully electric vehicle, continues to increase, which provides further confidence in future growth. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that project lifecycles in this end market run as high as 7 or more years, providing a high level of stability and stickiness. In healthcare today, the industries are undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations and the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets. OEMs are seeking to address these dynamics by shifting the focus away from manufacturing to improving patient outcomes. Jabil\u2019s credibility in the healthcare space has positioned us well to take advantage of this outsourcing of manufacturing trend. Should we enter an economic slowdown, it is our view that OEMs would in fact look to accelerate this outsourcing trend. A recession-resistant end market with long product lifecycles and accretive margins and stable cash flows is why healthcare continues to be such an important component of our diversified portfolio. Within connected devices, which I remind you is made up of a number of different customers, demand generally remains resilient. But given the consumer-centric nature of this end market, as we move from the pandemic fueled consumer spending to a more normalized environment, we feel it\u2019s appropriate to take a conservative outlook and expect some moderation in growth. And in mobility, demand signals continue to be strong as we navigate through our Q1 quarter. This quarter, which has historically been associated with channel fill during the seasonal product launch, is our highest revenue quarter. It\u2019s worth noting we have a long track record of operating successfully in this end market, which is being uniquely positioned within the portfolio as we partner with the most innovative brand and market leader in the space to supply key capabilities that are critical and hard to replicate. In summary, for DMS to me, the key takeaway this year is the considerable mix shift underway. In FY \u201823, automotive and transportation and healthcare and packaging are expected to be more than half of our DMS business with estimated revenue growth of approximately $1.2 billion combined in FY \u201823. Putting it altogether for DMS in FY \u201823, we are expecting 20 basis points of margin expansion on a low to mid single-digit revenue growth. Turning now to EMS, in digital print and retail, we expect some moderation in consumer print as people return to office to slightly offset growth in industrial print and e-commerce and warehouse automation systems. Within retail, both in customer-facing stores and in the warehouse, technology is shifting rapidly. As a result, we are building and ramping some of the most complex e-commerce and warehouse automation systems in the industry, which gives us confidence in our FY \u201823 outlook. Within our industrial business, we expect clean and smart energy infrastructure to drive growth for FY \u201823. There are a few major trends which drive growth in this space, but the overarching one is the green energy revolution. Government legislation such as the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. with the sizable subsidies and incentives is already beginning to increase investment in the space. As a reminder, we play across the entire energy value chain from energy generation in solar panels, power conversion, transmission, storage and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings. These projects have multiyear investment timelines independent of underlying short-term economic growth forecast, so we feel comfortable with the visibility we have in this space. Within semi cap, so far customers continue to march ahead with CapEx investments executing to their investment roadmaps with the recently introduced CHIPS Act providing an additional catalyst in this space. I remind you our strategy in this end market has been very thoughtful due to the high cyclicality of the semi cap market. And we have been very conservative around how we have invested in this business and our forecast for FY \u201823. On the 5G side, infrastructure rollouts are going extremely well and demand remains high in the U.S. and Europe. Rollouts are accelerating and our localized manufacturing capabilities are leading to market share gains in other geos such as India. We expect these rollouts to play out over the next several years regardless of near-term economic conditions. Therefore, we anticipate the 5G end market to continue to be resilient even in the face of moderate global slowdown. And in the cloud space, our expectation is that the ongoing shift away from on-prem will continue to accelerate, driving long-term growth in the space. If economic conditions weaken, our views of the cloud space should be a beneficiary as companies look to reduce costs in a moderating growth environment. It\u2019s worth reminding everyone we have deliberately structured our cloud business as a geo-centric, asset-light service offering with very low levels of CapEx and working capital. To ensure this business remains asset-light, we routinely look for mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers to optimize our asset-light model. With this in mind, in FY \u201823, approximately $500 million in components we procure and integrate will shift from the current purchase and resale model to a customer control consignment service model. This is in addition to the consignment of certain components we had announced in earlier years. This change will allow us to use our assets more efficiently in addition to improving margins. Adjusting for this shift, we expect continued robust unit growth in the cloud space in FY \u201823. And then finally, within legacy networking and storage end markets, the value proposition that Jabil provides, the best-in-class supply chain management, deep domain expertise and engineering capabilities and manufacturing in multiple geos, is resonating with our customers. And we expect market share already gained in the second half of FY \u201822 to drive growth in FY \u201823 with higher margins and robust cash flows. With the current mix of business in EMS, we expect 20 basis points of core margin expansion in fiscal \u201823 on low single-digit revenue growth. In summary, Jabil is not only well-diversified, but also markedly more resilient due to our multiyear proactive efforts to diversify our business and align to tomorrow\u2019s trends. As a result, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand to be resilient with year-over-year revenue growth at an enterprise level to be approximately 3% for FY \u201823 in spite of an economic slowdown. Moving to the next slide. For FY \u201823, we expect core operating margins to improve by a conservative 20 basis points over the prior year mainly driven by end market growth and improved mix of business. We also expect the investments we have made in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins in the future. Turning now to our CapEx guidance for FY \u201823, net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $875 million or 2.5% of net revenue. This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth and efficiency gains. In FY \u201823, we expect to continue to invest in targeted areas of our business with the bulk of our strategic growth CapEx aimed at the automotive EV space, along with the healthcare, 5G wireless, power generation and industrial end markets, generating multiyear returns in FY \u201823 and beyond. Our improved profitability, strong operational performance and disciplined investment has yielded significant cash flow over the last few years, which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business. Moving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows. This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team\u2019s disciplined approach and ability to execute. In FY \u201823, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of more than $900 million. It is important to note that this estimate is based on our current expectations of a moderation in growth and continuing supply chain constraints in certain secular end markets. Paradoxically, a more severe recession is likely to improve cash flows due to the working capital nature of our business. Moving to the next slide. A key aspect of delivering high returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized. Over the last year, the team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered at an attractive interest rate. We ended FY \u201822 with committed capacity on global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe affords us ample flexibility. And importantly, we\u2019re fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Turning now to our capital allocation framework, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, it\u2019s an appropriate time to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level, how we plan to deploy our capital over the next 2 years. This morning, included in our earnings filing, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program authorization from our Board of Directors with this incremental authorization we have approximately $1.3 billion in share repurchase authorization, reflecting our belief and confidence in Jabil\u2019s ability to generate strong earnings and free cash flows. Turning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 2% on a year-over-year basis to $4.8 billion. And EMS segment revenue is expected to be $4.5 billion, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 to be in the range of $9 billion to $9.6 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $415 million to $475 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $367 million to $427 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2 to $2.40. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. Interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million and for FY \u201823 to be approximately $230 million. On fiscal \u201823, we will adopt an annual normalized tax rate for the computation for our core income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. As a result, the tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter and for the fiscal year is estimated to be 19%. As we transition to our final slide, we expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment. Today, our business serves a diverse plan of end markets and areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.8% in core margins in FY \u201823 along with $8.15 in core EPS and more than $900 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. I\u2019d like to thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I\u2019ll begin by saying thanks to our team here at Jabil. I applaud the terrific care you give our customers while also keeping our people safe. Your attitude is amazing, and your stamina is incredible. Again, thank you. Today marks our 5th annual investor session, a day where we share insights and lay out the groundwork for our business. Adam and Mike discussed our progress, which largely stems from the construct and pedigree of the company. I\u2019ll expand on this and offer more thoughts, starting with our approach. At Jabil, each employee is critical to our success, and everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. As you know, we operate our business across a broad range of geographies with team members that don\u2019t look the same, don\u2019t talk the same, that have physical limitations and neurodiversities, team members that practice different religions and team members that have different sexual orientations. The diversity we have throughout the company simply makes us better, better as a team and better for our customers. Second element of our approach pertains to ESG and sustainability. At Jabil, we aim to always do what\u2019s right. This includes doing right for our planet and doing right for our communities. Our focus when it comes to ESG is grounded by our actions. An example is our goal of a 50% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Another example that we have underway is directed towards mental health, a topic that impacts all of us either directly or indirectly. Lastly, another action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back. Our employees collectively are donating 1 million hours of their time during calendar 2022. Although it isn\u2019t the 1 million hours per se, it\u2019s the positive difference our Jabil team is making around the world. Their efforts are extraordinary and life-changing. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about our solutions and how they are enabled by our structure, our investments and our customers. You see, our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to act with precision and speed. Our investments enable our execution, which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary. And our customers enable our obsession. It allows us to solve the complex. Moving to Slide 41. You\u2019ll see a pie chart, which reflects our end markets, a portfolio which provides the foundation from which we run our business today, a foundation that offers a high degree of resiliency for the corporation, resiliency during times of macro and geopolitical disruptions and doing more typical times when we\u2019re faced with the demands put forth by our customers. A real strength of our portfolio is the presence we have in essential end markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing and clean energy, markets that we believe will stimulate continued growth in earnings, especially when combined with ongoing refinement and improvement of our more traditional businesses. Let\u2019s now take a look at how our business has performed over the last 4 to 5 years. The eight sectors shown here exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue with each sector having a meaningful contribution to our overall financial results. What\u2019s also captured on this slide are the end markets where we\u2019ve seen good growth, growth that we think will continue on a relative basis as we benefit from secular trends. Please turn to Slide 43, where we will review our outlook. As Mike alluded to, for FY \u201823, we plan to deliver revenue of $34.5 billion with a core operating margin of 4.8%, a 20 basis point expansion when compared to FY \u201822. This translates to $8.15 in core earnings per share, a growth of 7% year-on-year. In addition, we believe our free cash flow for FY \u201823 will be in excess of $900 million. Next, if we take our FY \u201822 results and our FY \u201823 guidance, step back a bit and look at the past few years, the data would suggest that what we\u2019re doing is working. And as I\u2019ve said previously, being well-diversified in our business is a significant catalyst. But diversification for the sake of being diversified isn\u2019t all that special. What is special is the composition of our diversification. And if we expand on the current composition of our business, we don\u2019t anticipate any single product or any single product family to contribute more than 5% to 6% to our overall earnings in FY \u201823. And that\u2019s a good thing. Moving on from our financials, I\u2019d like to talk a bit about our purpose. At Jabil, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost. And this guidepost places an emphasis on caring, perspective, proper intentions and truthfulness. These characteristics drive our behaviors in all we do. I\u2019m proud of our team as they embrace our purpose and with their firm embrace comes exceptional conduct. If we could now move to Slide 46 where we can go over our path forward. As we think about fiscal \u201823, we will certainly measure our success based on financial performance. But we will also grade ourselves on keeping our people safe, exceptional customer care and how we interact with our suppliers, suppliers who stood by us and supported us during these most recent difficult times. By the way, thanks to everyone listening today who partners with Jabil on the supply side of our business, we are grateful. As our path forward, it\u2019s clear that our journey is based on our unique combination of approach, structure and experience, our confidence in our ability to execute combined with our engineering expertise, our financial outlook which was formed with rational assumptions and our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. In closing, we believe Jabil is making the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. And in doing what you do each day, I want all of you to be your true self without fear or recourse. I\u2019m honored to serve such a reliable team. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mark. There is clearly a lot to like about Jabil today. To summarize, we began by describing how Jabil has undergone deep and sustainable improvements to its business model. And we highlighted the solid foundation upon which the company sits today. Then Mike walked you through our financial playbook, highlighted by the strength of our portfolio, fueled by long-term secular tailwinds. And importantly, Mike talked about our financial outlook against a challenged macroeconomic background. To reiterate, today, demand still remains strong and well ahead of supply. But as Mike noted, conservatism has been baked into today\u2019s model, which anticipates good revenue growth, expanding margins and strong cash flows. And finally, to wrap up our session today, Mark offered insight into our unique approach, solutions, portfolio and purpose. I want to thank you for your time today, and we appreciate your interest in Jabil. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now live.\nJim Suva: Thank you and congratulations on the results and very strong outlook for both the quarter and the year. Our thoughts and of course, go out to you and your loved ones and families as the weather looks like it\u2019s getting quite negative there with the hurricane. In lieu of that just wanted to know your outlook for the first quarter and full year. Does it build in a little bit for hurricane? I know it\u2019s hard to predict, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got a playbook for closing up factories and making sure, importantly, employees are safe and communicating with customers. But I assume that there is something built in there. Is that true? And I assume you\u2019re probably going through procedures for the negative weather situation.\nMark Mondello: Thanks for the comments, Jim. Yes, we \u2013 if I think about the last number of years, starting with COVID and indexing all the way through today, we\u2019ve dealt with a lot of challenges, which, by the way, to me, as I said in my prepared remarks, makes our team, I don\u2019t know, even more reliable and more terrific when we think about power outages and COVID and COVID lingering and COVID shutdowns and geopolitical issues and the unfortunate continued war in Ukraine and inflation and rising costs. And now we\u2019ve \u2013 we are dealing with what looks to be a fairly nasty storm in the Tampa Bay area. Specific to the storm these things ebb and flow by the hour. Right now, the outlook doesn\u2019t look so good. To put that in context, we\u2019ve got about 250,000-plus people in the company around the world. We\u2019ve got around 3,000 in the Tampa Bay area. So first and foremost, right after we get off the call, we will go around again and check to be sure everybody is doing the right things. And after the storm passes, we will be sure everybody is okay, much like we do in any geography. So \u2013 and we do have our defense and aerospace factory here, and we will use standard Jabil protocols. We\u2019ve closed the campus starting this afternoon, and the campus will be closed through the end of the week. There\u2019ll be no material impact whatsoever to Q1 or our guide for \u201823. And again, Jim, appreciate the kind words.\nJim Suva: Great. And then as my quick follow-up, it sounds like your consignment model and could business is actually progressing to be a more deeper relationship than say a couple of years ago. Is that true? And does this lead to kind of increasingly more opportunities both on maybe less so revenues because it\u2019s a net model, but more so profitability and more potential improvement in margins?\nMark Mondello: Maybe I could break that into two. First, on the depth of the relationship, the depth of the relationship we have with our largest customer in the cloud business is substantial. And we really appreciate that, and we work really hard to earn that, but that relationship is in great shape. When I think about all of our relationships in the cloud, 5G wireless area, we\u2019re really pleased with the areas in which we get to participate and feel pretty bullish about that through \u201823 and hopefully going into \u201824. Specific to the cloud business, Jim, you alluded to the fact that I think we first started talking about our strategy that we had around a geo-centric configuration type of solution in the cloud space, largely around enhanced flexibility, agility and taking a lot of inventory and slack out of the supply chain. That\u2019s proven to be a good assumption. I think we started talking about this back in 2018, \u201919 time frame. We also, at that same point in time early on, we crafted this business to be \u2013 and Mike talked about this a bit, what we kind of talk about is asset light. So lots of agility, lots of speed in the configuration, moving very quickly, low count of fixed assets on a relative basis to other parts of our business and then very efficient working capital management. As part of that, we use this term consignment, and I don\u2019t want people to be confused about what consignment is. Consignment isn\u2019t any type of financial tool or anything we do to juice up margins per se. Consignment is simply around \u2013 when we take a look at what we do in the supply chain, what values we add, there is simply some materials based with our relationship with the suppliers as well as our customers where we add very little value. And so based on that, we continue to evolve and craft the supply chain in our cloud business, where we\u2019re spending most of our time adding great value. The impact of that, and again, Mike talked about this in his prepared remarks, is that for fiscal \u201823, roughly, give or take a bit, about $500 million of material content will come out of the natural cloud business for \u201823. And so the impact of that is if you look at the slides we presented, our cloud business going from FY \u201822 to FY \u201823 on a dollar basis, I think, shows a $200 million decline, \u201822 to \u201823. I don\u2019t remember the exact slides, but we\u2019ve been through the numbers enough. So cloud, 5G wireless was about a $6.5 billion business in \u201822. Cloud, 5G wireless in \u201823 will be a bit lower than that in the $6.3 billion, $6.4 billion range. But on a unit volume basis, volumes are up and growth is exactly where we thought it would be for \u201823. So again, the dollars can appear a little bit distorted, but that is all about the fact that it\u2019s a continuation of running the cloud business in an asset-light manner.\nJim Suva: Thank you and congratulations once again.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Perhaps your line is on mute. Please pickup your handset. \nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, it\u2019s Ruplu, thanks for taking my questions. And I hope you guys are staying safe over there in Florida. Mark, I have a couple of questions for you. First, on the EMS business. Can you talk a little bit about the seasonality of that business? I mean, there is so many different end markets there. You\u2019re guiding for strong growth. But just as we think about fiscal \u201823, how should we think about seasonality in that business?\nMark Mondello: How should you think about seasonality? I just don\u2019t \u2013 Ruplu, I know where you\u2019re getting at, right? I don\u2019t \u2013 I just don\u2019t think seasonality \u2013 I don\u2019t think of seasonality in the EMS space. It\u2019s really about the evolving construct of the business. So what might appear on the surface as seasonality is just a continuance of reshaping that business again as we focus on a good blend of margins and cash flows. I guess for modeling purposes, I don\u2019t want to be too prescript here, but I think with the guide that Mike provided for Q1 of \u201823, I think our margins on the EMS side year-on-year, I would guess we will be up 20, 30 basis points. So if you take a look at EMS by \u2013 and in and of itself, if you take a look at Q1 \u201822, you match that to Q1 \u201823, I would think the EMS margins will be up again 20, 30 basis points. And then if you kind of extrapolate out Q2, Q3, Q4, I would guess margins will be similar as they were in \u201822. And I think the best part of the overall story with EMS is in FY \u201821, I think our EMS margins were sub 4%. I think in FY \u201822, our EMS margins were 4.3%. And I think in FY \u201823, the EMS margins will be closer to 4.5% to 4.6%, somewhere in that range.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Hi, yes, thanks, and good morning. And thanks for all the good information so far. A couple of questions for me. One, just in your outlook, you are guiding networking and storage up roughly 6% for next year. A little surprising and strong given concerns about IT spending slowdown, is there \u2013 are you getting a positive forecast from customers of the supply constraints easing? And is that giving you some more confidence in your guide? Any color there would be great?\nMark Mondello: Sure, Matt. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 I think we would agree with you on the demand side. In overall general terms, I would say the 5, 6 points of upside is two things. A, there is still a decent amount of backlog that needs to be replenished. And supply chain is getting better, albeit slowly, but moving in the right direction. And number two is a lot of that is what I would kind of consider wonderful customers but legacy customers nonetheless. And we continue to pick up small pockets of share in the business. So I would say those are the main two components driving the growth from \u201822 to \u201823.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of smaller questions, one, just on your outlook, I don\u2019t think you provided a share count guide for Q1 or for \u201823. Does your \u201823 guide contemplate lower shares with the buyback?\nMike Dastoor: Hey Matt. Yes, it does. I would use so for the year were about 138 million to 140 million and for Q1 in the 141 million, 142 million range.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. And just lastly, on the consignment shift with the cloud business, that 500 million, does that begin this quarter so that\u2019s reflected in the year-over-year growth rates in Q1?\nMark Mondello: I would say the \u2013 our best estimate is if you notice, as you guys build out your models, I think you will see what could appear to be maybe a little bit of distortion first half to second half if you compare \u201822 to \u201823, specifically on the EMS side. That would suggest that the \u2013 most of the consignment impact for the year will be towards the back half.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Great. Thanks so much again.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning everyone. Two questions from me if I could. First of all, Mark, can you give us a sense of how your manufacturing footprint has changed over, say, the past year and into \u2013 how you are planning to change it next year, not so much like where things are located but maybe capabilities in different regions and if you could just maybe dial in a little bit on India and Southeast Asia ex-China? And then as a follow-up, Mark \u2013 Mike, can you talk about the cash flows a little bit more? So, the buybacks are \u2013 now you have a pretty huge percentage relative to your market cap sort of earmarked for buybacks. You are saying 80% of cash flows. And obviously, there is a range of cash flow outcomes depending on what you do with inventories. Can we assume that, that 80% is solid no matter what cash flows turn out, or if you wind up with a lot more free cash flow because of inventories that maybe you would dial down the buybacks? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Let me comment on the last comment first. And I know Mike will add to it and correct me \u2013 he will correct me where I am wrong for sure. But I think the 80%, I think is firm. And I think that will include the buybacks plus our dividend over the next couple of years, and Mike can expand on that. In terms of the footprint, Steve, there is no big changes to our footprint anticipated \u201822 to \u201823. We really like the footprint that we have. We think that our current footprint with the number of factories you have in the U.S. and our ability to expand those factories might serve us well to the extent there is some re-showing [ph] with clean energy. We will see what happens with the CHIPS Act. We have been staying very close to that directly with our friends in D.C. There is a lot of details that need to be worked out there. But that\u2019s one thing I could think about. But as we often say, the nice thing about Jabil is if you take a look at our capabilities, you take a look at our scale, almost independent of geopolitical issues, there is going to be some bumpiness for sure on the macro. But over the next 3 years to 5 years, there is a lot of things that still need to be built. And we have build stuff, and we do it awfully well. And we can accommodate the needs of nearly any geography either on the supply side or the demand side. I would \u2013 I think you asked about Southeast Asia and India. Over the last number of years, we have expanded into and continue to grow in Malaysia. We have ramped up a wonderful campus in Vietnam. We will continue \u2013 Southeast Asia will certainly continue to be of interest to us. By the way, we also have a wonderful footprint in Mainland China that we are pleased with. And then lastly, for India, I think India, we have done what I would consider moderate, maybe even modest on a relative basis investments in India around the Mumbai area in Pune. And that campus continues to scale. If I had to wave a magic wand and kind of guess what things might look like in India, say, in FY \u201824 or \u201825, my guess would be our footprint in India will be greater in fiscal \u201824 and \u201825 than it is today.\nMike Dastoor: And Steve, on your buyback question, if you look at what we have done in FY \u201822, we repurchased almost 700 million of our shares. We will continue to be well-balanced in our approach and opportunistic at the same time. We have an additional authorization of another $1 billion, bringing our total authorization to almost $1.3 billion. If you look at the end markets that we play in, the secular tailwinds that we continue to see, our margin accretion, our EPS accretion, cash flow accretion, all leads me to think that we are highly undervalued. And we feel buybacks is the best way to tackle that issue.\nSteven Fox: Great. All of that\u2019s super helpful. Of course, positioned the best regarding the area. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question and let me add my thoughts for everyone in Florida. The company\u2019s fiscal \u201823 guidance assumes a slowdown in certain end markets, even though, as I understand it, demand is generally strong. So, double-click on that a bit, better understand. Are there end markets where the company has seen signs of macro-related slowness as you start fiscal \u201823, or is it really related to your assumptions about what may materialize based on your history with the business?\nMark Mondello: Well, this is ever changing. And we will see what the next 60 days, 90 days, 120 days hold between monetary policy and everything else. I would say, as we sit today, Mark, the only area that we are seeing distinct decline in demand is around connected devices and consumer goods. Other than that, everything is either flat to up. I spoke about the 5G cloud. Again, unit volumes are up. So, of the eight sectors that we talk about in our business, the one that\u2019s down based on demand or our belief of what\u2019s going to happen in demand is in the area of consumer products and connected devices.\nMark Delaney: That\u2019s helpful. On supply chain, you said it\u2019s getting somewhat better, but still issues. Are the issues semiconductor supply demand or are there other supply chain constraints that the company is dealing with? And can you just elaborate a little bit more on how you see that playing out over the course of fiscal \u201823?\nMark Mondello: I would say if we go back 1 year ago, say, 9 months to 12 months ago, we had tremendous challenges more broad-based across the supply chain. As we sit today, we still have pockets of challenges. I would say the biggest challenges we have are around legacy semiconductors, and probably the biggest friction points continue to be around the EV space and the healthcare space. But on a relative basis, what we said the last number of calls is our Jabil team is doing a wonderful job in securing parts relative to others. So, we will continue to secure the parts. Our \u2013 the nice thing about how we look to forecast the business, whether it\u2019s on an annual basis like today where we go a degree deeper, it\u2019s on our quarterly calls, with our systems, our IT systems, how everything is linked together in terms of our factories, it really allows us real time to understand the puts and the takes of the business from the bottoms up. So, we start every single session with input and data from the factories as well as the customers. So, I think we have contemplated all of the supply chain issues that are at hand at the moment as we have offered the outlook for \u201823.\nMark Delaney: If I could sneak one last question in, that we mentioned electricity costs going higher in China, although I think, unfortunately, they are also higher in Europe. Maybe you could remind us to what extent those are typically part of the cost-plus structure? And are you expecting you can pass on higher electricity costs in fiscal \u201823, or is that maybe a headwind you baked into the guidance? Thank you and congratulations on the good results.\nMark Mondello: So, I think things are very \u2013 are different. Maybe they are both going to be rising. You talked about China. Again, we saw some power outages there in the fourth quarter. We baked in some conservatism there for \u201823, although it\u2019s modest. In terms of Europe, our two big revenue generators are Poland and Hungary. We have taken a hard look at and kind of done a deep dive in the construct of Poland and Hungary generate their power. We think the impact to us through the winter months in Europe will be modest as well. And I would just say that if I just kind of wrap that up into Jabil\u2019s more global footprint, we have seen and we will continue to see rising costs in various areas of our business. And we handle that differently with every single customer depending on the relationship, the terms and the overall economics. The good news is I think we have given appropriate if not deep consideration to all of that. And we are still bringing forward an outlook for \u201823 that takes margins up 20 basis points to 4.8%.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I was wondering sort of big picture, as you talk to your customers, Industry 4.0 with robotics, 3D printing, AI, ML, all of the technology that people are bringing to bear with regard to manufacturing, I am wondering how much of that is part of a discussion with your customers, both from sort of a competitive advantage standpoint as well as the ability to increase margins over time? And as I look at your margin profile, obviously, it\u2019s improving, but I am wondering how much of this is increased automation and things you can do yourself versus mix? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: I like your question because whether it\u2019s Industry 3.0 or 4.0, I am not quite sure. But at Jabil, it\u2019s kind of 1.0. It\u2019s right at the heart of what we do. Our business is complicated at times. Our strategy is really straightforward. Our strategy gets driven by each of the individual sectors because that\u2019s where all the domain expertise lies. And then at an enterprise level, we build stuff. And the better we build stuff, the more flexible we are in building stuff, the better our geography is in serving customers, the better engineering is, the more market share gains we will continue to capture as we move forward. And Shannon, a big part of that is, again, I think if we are not the largest, we are one of the largest large-scale manufacturing services company in the world. And a huge, huge amount of that is always our OpEx and our CapEx investments. And we just believe deeply in investing in the business because, again, we don\u2019t want to be making decisions for today that aren\u2019t great decisions long-term. And those investments are great decisions long-term. So, whether it\u2019s AR, VR, whether it\u2019s artificial intelligence, whether it\u2019s additional data analytics, whether it\u2019s robotics, automation, by the way, we make significant investments in those areas. I would guess that independent of our customers between our overall advancement in IT, data analytics, robotics, all of that stuff, our OpEx investments are probably $400 million to $500 million a year. And we think those are terrific investments for the company and will be very material as we move forward and run this company north of 5% at a very large scale.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. And this is sort of a derivative question but currency, I am wondering how that comes into the conversations with customers in terms of where you are manufacturing versus some of the currency moves or if it\u2019s a topic of discussion at all, given where everything has moved in the last, say, six months, there have been some pretty aggressive currency swings. So, I am just wondering if that comes up in any of your discussions. Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Sure. So, I will answer that. I think if you look at how we structure our pricing, etcetera, the revenue is mainly predominantly U.S. dollar-based bill of material that we buy from suppliers is mainly predominantly U.S. dollar-based. The value-add that you get, the local labor, the local cost, yes, those fluctuate. We do have true-up mechanisms with our customers to re-price if there is a significant move. And we also hedge our FX on the value-add portion as well. So, overall, FX is not something I lose sleep over.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Paul Chung from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, just some follow-ups on cap allocation. Very strong free cash flow here at the end of the year and pretty nice outlook here kind of approaching $1 billion annually. So, why not increase the authorization higher? And then secondly, on the kind of acquisitions front, where should we expect the firm to be a little bit more active here? Should we expect kind of this continued in-house investments for customers and reimbursement, or where can the firm be a little bit more active given some depressed private valuations here?\nMark Mondello: Thanks for the questions, Paul. Just on the buybacks, I think your comment was, why not be more aggressive. I think we are being very aggressive. If we just take a look at cash flows we dealt \u2013 we delivered in \u201822 and the level of buyback, the level of buybacks, and Mike talked about this level of buybacks in \u201822 was north of 700 million on free cash flows of $800 million. I consider that extremely aggressive. By the way, that doesn\u2019t include our dividend. If I think about \u201823 and \u201824, Mike talked about the fact that we got authorization for an extra $1 billion. We add that to the unused portion of the prior authorization, that puts in play about $1.3 billion. If I think about our free cash flow this year being $900 million, and we are saying nothing about fiscal \u201824, but hypothetically, let\u2019s say it was around $1 billion, you got $1.9 billion in free cash flow. And now you are talking about a total authorization of $1.3 billion plus another $100 million plus for dividend, you are talking about us returning $1.4 billion or give or take against free cash flows of $1.9 billion. So, I think that\u2019s appropriate and we could debate whether or not it\u2019s aggressive enough. But I think it\u2019s a very nice returning capital directly to shareholders. In terms of M&A, we think \u2013 so again, I think one of the charm, the real charming part of being in our business with all the complexities is it\u2019s a big world out there. And I said earlier, there is lots and lots and lots of things that need to be built. And the world is not going to become virtual completely, and the world is not going to become kind of holographic. It\u2019s like there is hard things. We talk internally sometimes, a big part of the way we run the business is digital with ones and zeros, but the output of that is based in atoms. I mean, they are hard, tangible things we build. And again, the market is massive. So, I just \u2013 we will continue to do small acquisitions, largely around acquiring engineering talent and technical capabilities. But the best use of our capital, A, is exactly what you alluded to is at these valuations, returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buyback. And then also the best use of our cash is both CapEx and OpEx investments, again, with an eye on continuing to pick up share, continuing to position us in a very dominant portion of the overall supply chain and then also with an eye on getting the margins for the company over 5% on a sustainable basis.\nPaul Chung: Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on component inflation, are you starting to see kind of more normalized prices in the market today? And then if we start to see more kind of deflationary environment on components, how do we think about the impact on margins and cash flows? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: I would say to your \u2013 the first part of your question is the overall \u2013 if I take a look at all of our bill of materials, which are in the tens of thousands and extrapolate this comment over all of it, the supply chain is very mixed. There is some part of the supply chain that\u2019s already more normalized, and there is some part of the supply chain remaining that\u2019s inflationary. I think that continues to move in the direction of over time of being more normalized. And in terms of the bill of materials becoming deflationary, I don\u2019t think we have to worry about that so much in \u201823. We will see what happens in the first half of \u201824. But we have been doing this a long time. And if you just kind of think about the 55 years that Jabil has been in business and maybe focus on the last 30 years, it\u2019s just been a continuous sine wave of up, down, up, down, up, down in terms of our variable costs or fixed costs and cost of bill of material. I think we will continue to navigate. We will continue to navigate that quite well with customers. And I don\u2019t envision \u2013 I certainly don\u2019t envision \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have guided the 4.8% this year if we thought there was a risk to that. And I think this morning alone, I have mentioned the idea of running the company at 5% with, I think a purposeful consideration of what might happen to the materials market, the component market and our bill of materials, we feel pretty confident of driving the margins to 5%.\nPaul Chung: Great. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Great. Thanks very much guys. I am hunkering down just south of you. It looks like they are calling for a direct hit here now. So, quite an eventful day for all of us, I guess. You mentioned supply is starting to ease. Can you share if that\u2019s more due to just Jabil sourcing, just improved efficiency on your part, or are you seeing it free up more generally? And then I have got a follow-up to that.\nMark Mondello: Well, Melissa, first off, keep yourself safe. And I don\u2019t think today is going to be all that exciting, but certainly, starting at noon tomorrow, I think things will get quite interesting. So, please keep safe. In terms of the overall bill of material, I think some of it is our scale and our leverage. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we just have a wonderful network of suppliers. So, I think that\u2019s part of it. I think the other part of it is with the current monetary policies and things going on around the world, I think in general, and this is now becoming maybe a little bit more, and I used the word a little bit, a little bit more of the rule versus the exception. But I think demand in general on a macro basis will start to soften a bit. I mentioned earlier that we are seeing it largely around consumer product, connected devices. But I think demand will start to soften a bit. And I think that\u2019s going to help with overall supply chain, both continuity and supply as we move forward in the next 9 months, 12 months, 18 months.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay. Great. And then you mentioned inventories would be worked down over time. What would be your ideal inventory target? Is there excess inventory that you are holding that you are specifically looking to destock?\nMark Mondello: So, there is inventories we are holding today that \u2013 yes, I love your term. We would like to destock those, and we are going to work very hard to destock some of these things in FY \u201823. They were put there with purpose. They are there to support the customers, the old adage of the golden screw deal. We have been dealing with that for a long, long time. We think that starts to normalize the back half of \u201823. And so I would guess we are very pleased, by the way, with the progress that we have made in terms of days of inventory reduction as we got to the back half of fiscal \u201822. And I would guess we will see a similar trajectory as we move through \u201823 on a relative basis. So, I would be really disappointed if we are sitting here, let\u2019s say, in the second half of \u201823 and our overall inventory levels are not down in a material way.\nMike Dastoor: And Melissa, just as a reminder, most of our inventory is actually raw materials and WIP. There is very little finished goods. So, we don\u2019t have a finished good problem or any such lag. It\u2019s the raw materials and WIP. As Mark said, we bring it in for our customers after they place a PO. So, they are legally contractually obligated with that inventory as well. So, it\u2019s just a matter of the golden screw coming through and our manufacturing churning our products. It\u2019s a relatively different inventory situation than perhaps retailers or any other type of market.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Sure. Perfect. Thanks very much. That\u2019s all for me. Stay safe guys.\nMark Mondello: You too Melissa. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is a follow-up from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up and Mark thanks for all the details you gave so far. I wanted to ask you a question on risk management in the DMS segment. If we look at mobility revenues, right, so fiscal \u201822 came in a little bit lower than what you had expected $100 million, and you are guiding another $100 million lower for fiscal \u201823. But now connected devices, as you said is a consumer-facing end market, and you are guiding that down 9%. So, when I look at these two things, mobility and connected devices, they are about 47% of the fiscal \u201823 guide for DMS. In case these markets are weaker than what you expect, how would your playbook change? Are there areas of investment that you would switch to other areas? And overall, do you think that there is enough strength in the automotive and healthcare segments that \u2013 though that strength can balance any weakness in these other two segments? So, just your thoughts on if there is incremental weakness in these two end markets, mobility and connected devices, how your playbook changes? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Just a general comment that I don\u2019t think has much to do with your question. I think the one area I would look at is in overall DMS, we continue to see awfully good growth in EVs, automotive and transport. And we see a good, stable, growing business in healthcare and packaging. So, I am not sure on your math on connected devices and mobility being 47% other than \u2013 and then we give it to you on the chart. I am just thinking about as we move into \u201824, \u201825 from an overall risk standpoint, I would \u2013 I think we are going to continue to see good trajectory of growth in the automotive, transport, healthcare, packaging as we move beyond \u201823. That\u2019s point number one. Point number two is I think trying to put together at least in regards to Jabil-specific, trying to put together connected devices with mobility, I wouldn\u2019t do that because there is different elements of those businesses beyond just raw demand that are material to Jabil in terms of our realized demand versus the overall marketplace. And last point to your question, I think on connected devices and mobility in general, as we sit today, the way in which we run both of those businesses and the way in which we have agreed commercial terms with the customers puts us in a situation where we feel pretty good in terms of risk management to both areas of the business.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for the detail. Appreciate it.\nMark Mondello: Yes. And sorry, I think you got cut off earlier. I apologize for that.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over for any further closing comments.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAdam Berry: Our call has concluded. Thank you for your interest in Jabil.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to our team here at Jabil. I applaud the terrific care you give our customers while also keeping our people safe. Your attitude is amazing, and your stamina is incredible. Again, thank you. Today marks our 5th annual investor session, a day where we share insights and lay out the groundwork for our business. Adam and Mike discussed our progress, which largely stems from the construct and pedigree of the company. I'll expand on this and offer more thoughts, starting with our approach. At Jabil, each employee is critical to our success, and everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. As you know, we operate our business across a broad range of geographies with team members that don't look the same, don't talk the same, that have physical limitations and neurodiversities, team members that practice different religions and team members that have different sexual orientations. The diversity we have throughout the company simply makes us better, better as a team and better for our customers. Second element of our approach pertains to ESG and sustainability. At Jabil, we aim to always do what's right. This includes doing right for our planet and doing right for our communities. Our focus when it comes to ESG is grounded by our actions. An example is our goal of a 50% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Another example that we have underway is directed towards mental health, a topic that impacts all of us either directly or indirectly. Lastly, another action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back. Our employees collectively are donating 1 million hours of their time during calendar 2022. Although it isn't the 1 million hours per se, it's the positive difference our Jabil team is making around the world. Their efforts are extraordinary and life-changing. Next, I'd like to talk about our solutions and how they are enabled by our structure, our investments and our customers. You see, our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to act with precision and speed. Our investments enable our execution, which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary. And our customers enable our obsession. It allows us to solve the complex. Moving to Slide 41. You'll see a pie chart, which reflects our end markets, a portfolio which provides the foundation from which we run our business today, a foundation that offers a high degree of resiliency for the corporation, resiliency during times of macro and geopolitical disruptions and doing more typical times when we're faced with the demands put forth by our customers. A real strength of our portfolio is the presence we have in essential end markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing and clean energy, markets that we believe will stimulate continued growth in earnings, especially when combined with ongoing refinement and improvement of our more traditional businesses. Let's now take a look at how our business has performed over the last 4 to 5 years. The eight sectors shown here exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue with each sector having a meaningful contribution to our overall financial results. What's also captured on this slide are the end markets where we've seen good growth, growth that we think will continue on a relative basis as we benefit from secular trends. Please turn to Slide 43, where we will review our outlook. As Mike alluded to, for FY \u201823, we plan to deliver revenue of $34.5 billion with a core operating margin of 4.8%, a 20 basis point expansion when compared to FY \u201822. This translates to $8.15 in core earnings per share, a growth of 7% year-on-year. In addition, we believe our free cash flow for FY \u201823 will be in excess of $900 million. Next, if we take our FY \u201822 results and our FY \u201823 guidance, step back a bit and look at the past few years, the data would suggest that what we're doing is working. And as I've said previously, being well-diversified in our business is a significant catalyst. But diversification for the sake of being diversified isn't all that special. What is special is the composition of our diversification. And if we expand on the current composition of our business, we don't anticipate any single product or any single product family to contribute more than 5% to 6% to our overall earnings in FY \u201823. And that's a good thing. Moving on from our financials, I'd like to talk a bit about our purpose. At Jabil, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost. And this guidepost places an emphasis on caring, perspective, proper intentions and truthfulness. These characteristics drive our behaviors in all we do. I'm proud of our team as they embrace our purpose and with their firm embrace comes exceptional conduct. If we could now move to Slide 46 where we can go over our path forward. As we think about fiscal \u201823, we will certainly measure our success based on financial performance. But we will also grade ourselves on keeping our people safe, exceptional customer care and how we interact with our suppliers, suppliers who stood by us and supported us during these most recent difficult times. By the way, thanks to everyone listening today who partners with Jabil on the supply side of our business, we are grateful. As our path forward, it's clear that our journey is based on our unique combination of approach, structure and experience, our confidence in our ability to execute combined with our engineering expertise, our financial outlook which was formed with rational assumptions and our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. In closing, we believe Jabil is making the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. And in doing what you do each day, I want all of you to be your true self without fear or recourse. I'm honored to serve such a reliable team. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Adam. Thanks for the comments, Jim. Yes, we \u2013 if I think about the last number of years, starting with COVID and indexing all the way through today, we've dealt with a lot of challenges, which, by the way, to me, as I said in my prepared remarks, makes our team, I don't know, even more reliable and more terrific when we think about power outages and COVID and COVID lingering and COVID shutdowns and geopolitical issues and the unfortunate continued war in Ukraine and inflation and rising costs. And now we've \u2013 we are dealing with what looks to be a fairly nasty storm in the Tampa Bay area. Specific to the storm these things ebb and flow by the hour. Right now, the outlook doesn't look so good. To put that in context, we've got about 250,000-plus people in the company around the world. We've got around 3,000 in the Tampa Bay area. So first and foremost, right after we get off the call, we will go around again and check to be sure everybody is doing the right things. And after the storm passes, we will be sure everybody is okay, much like we do in any geography. So \u2013 and we do have our defense and aerospace factory here, and we will use standard Jabil protocols. We've closed the campus starting this afternoon, and the campus will be closed through the end of the week. There'll be no material impact whatsoever to Q1 or our guide for \u201823. And again, Jim, appreciate the kind words. Maybe I could break that into two. First, on the depth of the relationship, the depth of the relationship we have with our largest customer in the cloud business is substantial. And we really appreciate that, and we work really hard to earn that, but that relationship is in great shape. When I think about all of our relationships in the cloud, 5G wireless area, we're really pleased with the areas in which we get to participate and feel pretty bullish about that through \u201823 and hopefully going into \u201824. Specific to the cloud business, Jim, you alluded to the fact that I think we first started talking about our strategy that we had around a geo-centric configuration type of solution in the cloud space, largely around enhanced flexibility, agility and taking a lot of inventory and slack out of the supply chain. That's proven to be a good assumption. I think we started talking about this back in 2018, '19 time frame. We also, at that same point in time early on, we crafted this business to be \u2013 and Mike talked about this a bit, what we kind of talk about is asset light. So lots of agility, lots of speed in the configuration, moving very quickly, low count of fixed assets on a relative basis to other parts of our business and then very efficient working capital management. As part of that, we use this term consignment, and I don't want people to be confused about what consignment is. Consignment isn't any type of financial tool or anything we do to juice up margins per se. Consignment is simply around \u2013 when we take a look at what we do in the supply chain, what values we add, there is simply some materials based with our relationship with the suppliers as well as our customers where we add very little value. And so based on that, we continue to evolve and craft the supply chain in our cloud business, where we're spending most of our time adding great value. The impact of that, and again, Mike talked about this in his prepared remarks, is that for fiscal \u201823, roughly, give or take a bit, about $500 million of material content will come out of the natural cloud business for \u201823. And so the impact of that is if you look at the slides we presented, our cloud business going from FY \u201822 to FY \u201823 on a dollar basis, I think, shows a $200 million decline, \u201822 to \u201823. I don't remember the exact slides, but we've been through the numbers enough. So cloud, 5G wireless was about a $6.5 billion business in \u201822. Cloud, 5G wireless in \u201823 will be a bit lower than that in the $6.3 billion, $6.4 billion range. But on a unit volume basis, volumes are up and growth is exactly where we thought it would be for \u201823. So again, the dollars can appear a little bit distorted, but that is all about the fact that it's a continuation of running the cloud business in an asset-light manner. Thanks, Jim. How should you think about seasonality? I just don't \u2013 Ruplu, I know where you're getting at, right? I don't \u2013 I just don't think seasonality \u2013 I don't think of seasonality in the EMS space. It's really about the evolving construct of the business. So what might appear on the surface as seasonality is just a continuance of reshaping that business again as we focus on a good blend of margins and cash flows. I guess for modeling purposes, I don't want to be too prescript here, but I think with the guide that Mike provided for Q1 of \u201823, I think our margins on the EMS side year-on-year, I would guess we will be up 20, 30 basis points. So if you take a look at EMS by \u2013 and in and of itself, if you take a look at Q1 \u201822, you match that to Q1 \u201823, I would think the EMS margins will be up again 20, 30 basis points. And then if you kind of extrapolate out Q2, Q3, Q4, I would guess margins will be similar as they were in \u201822. And I think the best part of the overall story with EMS is in FY \u201821, I think our EMS margins were sub 4%. I think in FY \u201822, our EMS margins were 4.3%. And I think in FY \u201823, the EMS margins will be closer to 4.5% to 4.6%, somewhere in that range. Sure, Matt. I don't think it's \u2013 I think we would agree with you on the demand side. In overall general terms, I would say the 5, 6 points of upside is two things. A, there is still a decent amount of backlog that needs to be replenished. And supply chain is getting better, albeit slowly, but moving in the right direction. And number two is a lot of that is what I would kind of consider wonderful customers but legacy customers nonetheless. And we continue to pick up small pockets of share in the business. So I would say those are the main two components driving the growth from \u201822 to \u201823. I would say the \u2013 our best estimate is if you notice, as you guys build out your models, I think you will see what could appear to be maybe a little bit of distortion first half to second half if you compare \u201822 to \u201823, specifically on the EMS side. That would suggest that the \u2013 most of the consignment impact for the year will be towards the back half. Yes. Thank you. Let me comment on the last comment first. And I know Mike will add to it and correct me \u2013 he will correct me where I am wrong for sure. But I think the 80%, I think is firm. And I think that will include the buybacks plus our dividend over the next couple of years, and Mike can expand on that. In terms of the footprint, Steve, there is no big changes to our footprint anticipated \u201822 to \u201823. We really like the footprint that we have. We think that our current footprint with the number of factories you have in the U.S. and our ability to expand those factories might serve us well to the extent there is some re-showing [ph] with clean energy. We will see what happens with the CHIPS Act. We have been staying very close to that directly with our friends in D.C. There is a lot of details that need to be worked out there. But that's one thing I could think about. But as we often say, the nice thing about Jabil is if you take a look at our capabilities, you take a look at our scale, almost independent of geopolitical issues, there is going to be some bumpiness for sure on the macro. But over the next 3 years to 5 years, there is a lot of things that still need to be built. And we have build stuff, and we do it awfully well. And we can accommodate the needs of nearly any geography either on the supply side or the demand side. I would \u2013 I think you asked about Southeast Asia and India. Over the last number of years, we have expanded into and continue to grow in Malaysia. We have ramped up a wonderful campus in Vietnam. We will continue \u2013 Southeast Asia will certainly continue to be of interest to us. By the way, we also have a wonderful footprint in Mainland China that we are pleased with. And then lastly, for India, I think India, we have done what I would consider moderate, maybe even modest on a relative basis investments in India around the Mumbai area in Pune. And that campus continues to scale. If I had to wave a magic wand and kind of guess what things might look like in India, say, in FY \u201824 or \u201825, my guess would be our footprint in India will be greater in fiscal \u201824 and \u201825 than it is today. Well, this is ever changing. And we will see what the next 60 days, 90 days, 120 days hold between monetary policy and everything else. I would say, as we sit today, Mark, the only area that we are seeing distinct decline in demand is around connected devices and consumer goods. Other than that, everything is either flat to up. I spoke about the 5G cloud. Again, unit volumes are up. So, of the eight sectors that we talk about in our business, the one that's down based on demand or our belief of what's going to happen in demand is in the area of consumer products and connected devices. I would say if we go back 1 year ago, say, 9 months to 12 months ago, we had tremendous challenges more broad-based across the supply chain. As we sit today, we still have pockets of challenges. I would say the biggest challenges we have are around legacy semiconductors, and probably the biggest friction points continue to be around the EV space and the healthcare space. But on a relative basis, what we said the last number of calls is our Jabil team is doing a wonderful job in securing parts relative to others. So, we will continue to secure the parts. Our \u2013 the nice thing about how we look to forecast the business, whether it's on an annual basis like today where we go a degree deeper, it's on our quarterly calls, with our systems, our IT systems, how everything is linked together in terms of our factories, it really allows us real time to understand the puts and the takes of the business from the bottoms up. So, we start every single session with input and data from the factories as well as the customers. So, I think we have contemplated all of the supply chain issues that are at hand at the moment as we have offered the outlook for \u201823. So, I think things are very \u2013 are different. Maybe they are both going to be rising. You talked about China. Again, we saw some power outages there in the fourth quarter. We baked in some conservatism there for \u201823, although it's modest. In terms of Europe, our two big revenue generators are Poland and Hungary. We have taken a hard look at and kind of done a deep dive in the construct of Poland and Hungary generate their power. We think the impact to us through the winter months in Europe will be modest as well. And I would just say that if I just kind of wrap that up into Jabil's more global footprint, we have seen and we will continue to see rising costs in various areas of our business. And we handle that differently with every single customer depending on the relationship, the terms and the overall economics. The good news is I think we have given appropriate if not deep consideration to all of that. And we are still bringing forward an outlook for \u201823 that takes margins up 20 basis points to 4.8%. I like your question because whether it's Industry 3.0 or 4.0, I am not quite sure. But at Jabil, it's kind of 1.0. It's right at the heart of what we do. Our business is complicated at times. Our strategy is really straightforward. Our strategy gets driven by each of the individual sectors because that's where all the domain expertise lies. And then at an enterprise level, we build stuff. And the better we build stuff, the more flexible we are in building stuff, the better our geography is in serving customers, the better engineering is, the more market share gains we will continue to capture as we move forward. And Shannon, a big part of that is, again, I think if we are not the largest, we are one of the largest large-scale manufacturing services company in the world. And a huge, huge amount of that is always our OpEx and our CapEx investments. And we just believe deeply in investing in the business because, again, we don't want to be making decisions for today that aren't great decisions long-term. And those investments are great decisions long-term. So, whether it's AR, VR, whether it's artificial intelligence, whether it's additional data analytics, whether it's robotics, automation, by the way, we make significant investments in those areas. I would guess that independent of our customers between our overall advancement in IT, data analytics, robotics, all of that stuff, our OpEx investments are probably $400 million to $500 million a year. And we think those are terrific investments for the company and will be very material as we move forward and run this company north of 5% at a very large scale. Thanks for the questions, Paul. Just on the buybacks, I think your comment was, why not be more aggressive. I think we are being very aggressive. If we just take a look at cash flows we dealt \u2013 we delivered in \u201822 and the level of buyback, the level of buybacks, and Mike talked about this level of buybacks in \u201822 was north of 700 million on free cash flows of $800 million. I consider that extremely aggressive. By the way, that doesn't include our dividend. If I think about \u201823 and \u201824, Mike talked about the fact that we got authorization for an extra $1 billion. We add that to the unused portion of the prior authorization, that puts in play about $1.3 billion. If I think about our free cash flow this year being $900 million, and we are saying nothing about fiscal \u201824, but hypothetically, let's say it was around $1 billion, you got $1.9 billion in free cash flow. And now you are talking about a total authorization of $1.3 billion plus another $100 million plus for dividend, you are talking about us returning $1.4 billion or give or take against free cash flows of $1.9 billion. So, I think that's appropriate and we could debate whether or not it's aggressive enough. But I think it's a very nice returning capital directly to shareholders. In terms of M&A, we think \u2013 so again, I think one of the charm, the real charming part of being in our business with all the complexities is it's a big world out there. And I said earlier, there is lots and lots and lots of things that need to be built. And the world is not going to become virtual completely, and the world is not going to become kind of holographic. It's like there is hard things. We talk internally sometimes, a big part of the way we run the business is digital with ones and zeros, but the output of that is based in atoms. I mean, they are hard, tangible things we build. And again, the market is massive. So, I just \u2013 we will continue to do small acquisitions, largely around acquiring engineering talent and technical capabilities. But the best use of our capital, A, is exactly what you alluded to is at these valuations, returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buyback. And then also the best use of our cash is both CapEx and OpEx investments, again, with an eye on continuing to pick up share, continuing to position us in a very dominant portion of the overall supply chain and then also with an eye on getting the margins for the company over 5% on a sustainable basis. I would say to your \u2013 the first part of your question is the overall \u2013 if I take a look at all of our bill of materials, which are in the tens of thousands and extrapolate this comment over all of it, the supply chain is very mixed. There is some part of the supply chain that's already more normalized, and there is some part of the supply chain remaining that's inflationary. I think that continues to move in the direction of over time of being more normalized. And in terms of the bill of materials becoming deflationary, I don't think we have to worry about that so much in \u201823. We will see what happens in the first half of \u201824. But we have been doing this a long time. And if you just kind of think about the 55 years that Jabil has been in business and maybe focus on the last 30 years, it's just been a continuous sine wave of up, down, up, down, up, down in terms of our variable costs or fixed costs and cost of bill of material. I think we will continue to navigate. We will continue to navigate that quite well with customers. And I don't envision \u2013 I certainly don't envision \u2013 we wouldn't have guided the 4.8% this year if we thought there was a risk to that. And I think this morning alone, I have mentioned the idea of running the company at 5% with, I think a purposeful consideration of what might happen to the materials market, the component market and our bill of materials, we feel pretty confident of driving the margins to 5%. Yes. You're welcome. Well, Melissa, first off, keep yourself safe. And I don't think today is going to be all that exciting, but certainly, starting at noon tomorrow, I think things will get quite interesting. So, please keep safe. In terms of the overall bill of material, I think some of it is our scale and our leverage. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we just have a wonderful network of suppliers. So, I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is with the current monetary policies and things going on around the world, I think in general, and this is now becoming maybe a little bit more, and I used the word a little bit, a little bit more of the rule versus the exception. But I think demand in general on a macro basis will start to soften a bit. I mentioned earlier that we are seeing it largely around consumer product, connected devices. But I think demand will start to soften a bit. And I think that's going to help with overall supply chain, both continuity and supply as we move forward in the next 9 months, 12 months, 18 months. So, there is inventories we are holding today that \u2013 yes, I love your term. We would like to destock those, and we are going to work very hard to destock some of these things in FY \u201823. They were put there with purpose. They are there to support the customers, the old adage of the golden screw deal. We have been dealing with that for a long, long time. We think that starts to normalize the back half of \u201823. And so I would guess we are very pleased, by the way, with the progress that we have made in terms of days of inventory reduction as we got to the back half of fiscal \u201822. And I would guess we will see a similar trajectory as we move through \u201823 on a relative basis. So, I would be really disappointed if we are sitting here, let's say, in the second half of \u201823 and our overall inventory levels are not down in a material way. You too Melissa. Thank you. Just a general comment that I don't think has much to do with your question. I think the one area I would look at is in overall DMS, we continue to see awfully good growth in EVs, automotive and transport. And we see a good, stable, growing business in healthcare and packaging. So, I am not sure on your math on connected devices and mobility being 47% other than \u2013 and then we give it to you on the chart. I am just thinking about as we move into \u201824, \u201825 from an overall risk standpoint, I would \u2013 I think we are going to continue to see good trajectory of growth in the automotive, transport, healthcare, packaging as we move beyond \u201823. That's point number one. Point number two is I think trying to put together at least in regards to Jabil-specific, trying to put together connected devices with mobility, I wouldn't do that because there is different elements of those businesses beyond just raw demand that are material to Jabil in terms of our realized demand versus the overall marketplace. And last point to your question, I think on connected devices and mobility in general, as we sit today, the way in which we run both of those businesses and the way in which we have agreed commercial terms with the customers puts us in a situation where we feel pretty good in terms of risk management to both areas of the business. Yes. And sorry, I think you got cut off earlier. I apologize for that."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. Our business model has been intentionally structured with the aim of delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth and strong predictable cash flows. On top of this, our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility. This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end market portfolio over the last several years, which has performed extremely well evidenced by a very strong FY \u201822 results. I am extremely pleased with the resiliency of our business, particularly considering the numerous challenges throughout the year with ongoing COVID waves, war in the Ukraine, global inflation, supply chain challenges and multiple energy shortages. Despite these challenges, we delivered year-on-year growth in revenue of 14%, core operating income of 24%, and core EPS of 36%, all while increasing core operating margin by 40 basis points over FY \u201821. At a segment level for the year, our DMS revenue was $16.7 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up 12% year-over-year. This resulted in core margin expanding 10 basis points to 4.9%. In EMS for the year, core operating income growth was incredibly strong, up 43% over the prior year. This resulted in core margin expanding an impressive 60 basis points over \u201821 on revenue of $16.7 billion. The strength in our EMS margins is reflective of our improving mix and strong leverage on 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In FY \u201822, fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $1.65 billion. For the quarter, inventory days came in at 79, down 6 days sequentially on improved working capital management by the team. It's worth noting that we offset a portion of our higher inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers, which reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of inventory deposits, inventory days was 62 in Q4, down 8 days from Q3. While I am pleased with the sequential decline in inventory days, the team continues to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY \u201823 as some of the supply chain constraints continue to ease. Net capital expenditures for the fiscal year were $841 million or 2.5% of net revenue. As a result of the strong Q4 cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $810 million. And finally, we exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x and cash balances of $1.5 billion. Next, I would like to provide some clarity on our CapEx as shown in our cash flow statement. As a reminder, our customers routinely co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then later reimbursed to us by customers. Due to the high dollar value, these co-investments from our customers and how they are reflected on our cash flow statement, it is important that the two line items shown on the slide to reflect the true CapEx number and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. Our net capital expenditures for the fiscal year amounted to $841 million. Moving now to our capital returns to shareholders on the next slide. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY \u201822 to 11.8 million shares or $696 million. To-date, we have utilized $737 million of our $1 billion authorization granted in July of last year. This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY \u201813 to approximately 102 million shares at an average price of $30, bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.6 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. In summary, I am extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the sustainable momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal \u201822. Moving to the next slide, where I will offer some insight about how we are thinking about the business this year by end market. Across most of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient, particularly in end markets that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds, many of which Adam highlighted a moment ago. We continue to expect these secular markets to expand in FY \u201823. We also expect some consumer-centric end markets to underperform compared to the robust growth for the past 18 months. Unlike in past economic slowdowns where Jabil was highly concentrated in a particular product or end market, today, it is critical to think of Jabil not as one company, but as a well-diversified accumulation of many end markets, a number of which we expect will continue to benefit from long-term secular tailwinds. This product and end market diversification, coupled with our global network of connected factories, global best-in-class supply chain management and deep domain expertise, makes Jabil today markedly more resilient than we were 5 to 10 years ago as evidenced by our strong results in the last few years in the face of multiple significant global challenges. Our FY \u201823 guidance assumes a moderate economic slowdown and some moderation in growth, which will impact certain end markets more than others. I would now like to walk you through each end market and describe how we are thinking about our business in the coming year. In our automotive and transportation end market, we expect the global transition to EVs to continue to drive robust growth within our automotive business despite choppy overall demand in global automotive purchases. Our view is that EV adoption will continue to accelerate and gain a larger share of the auto market in FY \u201823 regardless of the near-term global growth dynamics. Jabil's content per vehicle, which can be as high as $3,000 or more for a fully electric vehicle, continues to increase, which provides further confidence in future growth. It's also worth pointing out that project lifecycles in this end market run as high as 7 or more years, providing a high level of stability and stickiness. In healthcare today, the industries are undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations and the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets. OEMs are seeking to address these dynamics by shifting the focus away from manufacturing to improving patient outcomes. Jabil's credibility in the healthcare space has positioned us well to take advantage of this outsourcing of manufacturing trend. Should we enter an economic slowdown, it is our view that OEMs would in fact look to accelerate this outsourcing trend. A recession-resistant end market with long product lifecycles and accretive margins and stable cash flows is why healthcare continues to be such an important component of our diversified portfolio. Within connected devices, which I remind you is made up of a number of different customers, demand generally remains resilient. But given the consumer-centric nature of this end market, as we move from the pandemic fueled consumer spending to a more normalized environment, we feel it's appropriate to take a conservative outlook and expect some moderation in growth. And in mobility, demand signals continue to be strong as we navigate through our Q1 quarter. This quarter, which has historically been associated with channel fill during the seasonal product launch, is our highest revenue quarter. It's worth noting we have a long track record of operating successfully in this end market, which is being uniquely positioned within the portfolio as we partner with the most innovative brand and market leader in the space to supply key capabilities that are critical and hard to replicate. In summary, for DMS to me, the key takeaway this year is the considerable mix shift underway. In FY \u201823, automotive and transportation and healthcare and packaging are expected to be more than half of our DMS business with estimated revenue growth of approximately $1.2 billion combined in FY \u201823. Putting it altogether for DMS in FY \u201823, we are expecting 20 basis points of margin expansion on a low to mid single-digit revenue growth. Turning now to EMS, in digital print and retail, we expect some moderation in consumer print as people return to office to slightly offset growth in industrial print and e-commerce and warehouse automation systems. Within retail, both in customer-facing stores and in the warehouse, technology is shifting rapidly. As a result, we are building and ramping some of the most complex e-commerce and warehouse automation systems in the industry, which gives us confidence in our FY \u201823 outlook. Within our industrial business, we expect clean and smart energy infrastructure to drive growth for FY \u201823. There are a few major trends which drive growth in this space, but the overarching one is the green energy revolution. Government legislation such as the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. with the sizable subsidies and incentives is already beginning to increase investment in the space. As a reminder, we play across the entire energy value chain from energy generation in solar panels, power conversion, transmission, storage and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings. These projects have multiyear investment timelines independent of underlying short-term economic growth forecast, so we feel comfortable with the visibility we have in this space. Within semi cap, so far customers continue to march ahead with CapEx investments executing to their investment roadmaps with the recently introduced CHIPS Act providing an additional catalyst in this space. I remind you our strategy in this end market has been very thoughtful due to the high cyclicality of the semi cap market. And we have been very conservative around how we have invested in this business and our forecast for FY \u201823. On the 5G side, infrastructure rollouts are going extremely well and demand remains high in the U.S. and Europe. Rollouts are accelerating and our localized manufacturing capabilities are leading to market share gains in other geos such as India. We expect these rollouts to play out over the next several years regardless of near-term economic conditions. Therefore, we anticipate the 5G end market to continue to be resilient even in the face of moderate global slowdown. And in the cloud space, our expectation is that the ongoing shift away from on-prem will continue to accelerate, driving long-term growth in the space. If economic conditions weaken, our views of the cloud space should be a beneficiary as companies look to reduce costs in a moderating growth environment. It's worth reminding everyone we have deliberately structured our cloud business as a geo-centric, asset-light service offering with very low levels of CapEx and working capital. To ensure this business remains asset-light, we routinely look for mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers to optimize our asset-light model. With this in mind, in FY \u201823, approximately $500 million in components we procure and integrate will shift from the current purchase and resale model to a customer control consignment service model. This is in addition to the consignment of certain components we had announced in earlier years. This change will allow us to use our assets more efficiently in addition to improving margins. Adjusting for this shift, we expect continued robust unit growth in the cloud space in FY \u201823. And then finally, within legacy networking and storage end markets, the value proposition that Jabil provides, the best-in-class supply chain management, deep domain expertise and engineering capabilities and manufacturing in multiple geos, is resonating with our customers. And we expect market share already gained in the second half of FY \u201822 to drive growth in FY \u201823 with higher margins and robust cash flows. With the current mix of business in EMS, we expect 20 basis points of core margin expansion in fiscal \u201823 on low single-digit revenue growth. In summary, Jabil is not only well-diversified, but also markedly more resilient due to our multiyear proactive efforts to diversify our business and align to tomorrow's trends. As a result, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand to be resilient with year-over-year revenue growth at an enterprise level to be approximately 3% for FY \u201823 in spite of an economic slowdown. Moving to the next slide. For FY \u201823, we expect core operating margins to improve by a conservative 20 basis points over the prior year mainly driven by end market growth and improved mix of business. We also expect the investments we have made in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins in the future. Turning now to our CapEx guidance for FY \u201823, net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $875 million or 2.5% of net revenue. This will come through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth and efficiency gains. In FY \u201823, we expect to continue to invest in targeted areas of our business with the bulk of our strategic growth CapEx aimed at the automotive EV space, along with the healthcare, 5G wireless, power generation and industrial end markets, generating multiyear returns in FY \u201823 and beyond. Our improved profitability, strong operational performance and disciplined investment has yielded significant cash flow over the last few years, which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business. Moving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows. This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team's disciplined approach and ability to execute. In FY \u201823, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of more than $900 million. It is important to note that this estimate is based on our current expectations of a moderation in growth and continuing supply chain constraints in certain secular end markets. Paradoxically, a more severe recession is likely to improve cash flows due to the working capital nature of our business. Moving to the next slide. A key aspect of delivering high returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized. Over the last year, the team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered at an attractive interest rate. We ended FY \u201822 with committed capacity on global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe affords us ample flexibility. And importantly, we're fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Turning now to our capital allocation framework, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, it's an appropriate time to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level, how we plan to deploy our capital over the next 2 years. This morning, included in our earnings filing, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program authorization from our Board of Directors with this incremental authorization we have approximately $1.3 billion in share repurchase authorization, reflecting our belief and confidence in Jabil's ability to generate strong earnings and free cash flows. Turning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 2% on a year-over-year basis to $4.8 billion. And EMS segment revenue is expected to be $4.5 billion, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal \u201823 to be in the range of $9 billion to $9.6 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $415 million to $475 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $367 million to $427 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2 to $2.40. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. Interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million and for FY \u201823 to be approximately $230 million. On fiscal \u201823, we will adopt an annual normalized tax rate for the computation for our core income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. As a result, the tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter and for the fiscal year is estimated to be 19%. As we transition to our final slide, we expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment. Today, our business serves a diverse plan of end markets and areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.8% in core margins in FY \u201823 along with $8.15 in core EPS and more than $900 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. I'd like to thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Hey Matt. Yes, it does. I would use so for the year were about 138 million to 140 million and for Q1 in the 141 million, 142 million range. And Steve, on your buyback question, if you look at what we have done in FY \u201822, we repurchased almost 700 million of our shares. We will continue to be well-balanced in our approach and opportunistic at the same time. We have an additional authorization of another $1 billion, bringing our total authorization to almost $1.3 billion. If you look at the end markets that we play in, the secular tailwinds that we continue to see, our margin accretion, our EPS accretion, cash flow accretion, all leads me to think that we are highly undervalued. And we feel buybacks is the best way to tackle that issue. Sure. So, I will answer that. I think if you look at how we structure our pricing, etcetera, the revenue is mainly predominantly U.S. dollar-based bill of material that we buy from suppliers is mainly predominantly U.S. dollar-based. The value-add that you get, the local labor, the local cost, yes, those fluctuate. We do have true-up mechanisms with our customers to re-price if there is a significant move. And we also hedge our FX on the value-add portion as well. So, overall, FX is not something I lose sleep over. And Melissa, just as a reminder, most of our inventory is actually raw materials and WIP. There is very little finished goods. So, we don't have a finished good problem or any such lag. It's the raw materials and WIP. As Mark said, we bring it in for our customers after they place a PO. So, they are legally contractually obligated with that inventory as well. So, it's just a matter of the golden screw coming through and our manufacturing churning our products. It's a relatively different inventory situation than perhaps retailers or any other type of market."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Adam, you may now begin.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's third quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's session will be posted for audio playback on our website. I'd now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fourth quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for the tireless attention you offer our customers, and thank you for the manner in which you care for and accept one another. Let's now turn to Slide 5 and review our third quarter results. Q3 was another strong quarter driven by double-digit revenue growth and outstanding execution. Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.72 and revenue of $8.3 billion. This resulted in a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 40 basis point increase year-on-year. All in all, I'm quite pleased with the quarter. We're carrying good momentum as we start to think about FY '23. And when I think about momentum, I think about the primary catalysts behind our business, that being the makeup and scale of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide, Slide 6. The pie chart shown here reflects Jabil's commercial portfolio, which our team has built over the past five to six years, in essence, a large-scale, well-diversified foundation from which we run our business today. And the resulting output in having built this business is threefold. One, a higher level of resiliency for the corporation. Either during trying times of macro and geopolitical disruptions or during more typical times when we're simply faced with never-ending demand fluctuations. Two, Jabil's presence in new markets. Markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing and clean energy. Markets that we believe will drive earnings growth, especially when combined with the continued refinement and improvement of our traditional businesses. And finally, the third resultant output of our team's hard work is the assembly and collection of our many capabilities. Capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified. Moving to Slide 7. You'll see management's outlook for the year. We're anticipating core earnings per share to be $7.45, an increase of 33% year-on-year. As for revenue, fiscal '22 now looks to be $32.8 billion, while our outlook for core operating margin remains steady at 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year. In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for FY '22. Altogether, this year is a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows. And although we're navigating a tough environment, we have ample opportunities to consider as we formalize our business plan for fiscal '23. With this in mind, we look forward to hosting our fifth Annual Investor Briefing. And consistent with past years, the briefing will be held in late September. Adam will be confirming an exact date later this summer. We'll open the session by reporting our fourth quarter and full year results, we'll then follow with a complete review of our priorities and explain how these priorities will guide us through FY '23. Management will also share how we plan to further expand our core operating margin while sharing observations on end markets. In wrapping up the September session, Mike will share our capital return framework for FY '23 and FY '24. We have lots to share and a wonderful story to tell financially, operationally and commercially. With that, let's look at my final slide, where I'd like to talk about the importance of purpose. At Jabil, we act with purpose, and with purpose comes expectations. Expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, protecting the environment, giving back to our communities and ensuring a workplace of tolerance, respect and acceptance. Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been as important as they are today. I'm proud of our team as they embrace our purpose, and in doing so, their conduct is exceptional. In closing, I like the decisions we're making. At Jabil, we build stuff, and we do it really, really well. It's why we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. And when addressing these challenges, we do our best to make the world a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer each and every day. As I alluded to earlier in my prepared remarks, the world is a bit messy at the moment. What I do believe is Jabil executes well when times are steady, but I'm even more passionate in my belief that Jabil executes really well when times are difficult. Thank you for joining our call, and thanks for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was a great illustration of our diversification in action. I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the sustainable momentum at the enterprise level. In spite of a challenging supply chain environment and well-publicized shutdowns in China, the team still delivered exceptional results in revenue, core operating margin and core diluted earnings per share. For the quarter, revenue was approximately $8.3 billion, ahead of our forecast, driven by very strong demand within EMS, partially offset by sporadic COVID challenges within DMS. Altogether, on enterprise level, revenue grew by 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially as demand across end markets remain well ahead of supply. In Q3, our GAAP operating income was $321 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.52. Core operating income during the quarter was $352 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q3 came in above expectations at $45 million due to a combination of higher working capital and rising interest rates. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.72, a 32% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our third quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 7% on a year-over-year basis. Although upside in the quarter was limited in automotive, healthcare and mobility, we still experienced year-over-year growth in every end market within DMS. Core margin for the segment came in at 3.8%. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.5 billion, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis and well ahead of our plans for March. The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was extremely broad-based, with strength in our 5G Wireless & Cloud and Networking & Storage businesses, where we gained additional share during the quarter. As a result, our ability to execute in complex supply chains and deliver critical parts and components. Core margin for the segment was 4.6%, up 80 basis points for the prior year, reflecting exceptional cost control on higher-than-anticipated revenue. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q3, inventory days came in at 85 days, down one day sequentially and above our expectations in March, mainly due to the shutdowns in Shanghai which also impacted upstream and downstream supply chains. We offset a portion of higher inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of inventory deposits, inventory days were 70 in Q3, down one day from the previous quarter. As a quick reminder, our business model is designed such that we do not take risk on inventory in anticipation of sales. All inventory orders require a customer purchase order before triggering a purchase request within our MRP system. Majority of our inventory continues to be mainly associated with raw materials as a result of kicking issues and timing of components. At the end of Q3, finished goods represented a very small level at approximately 11% of inventory consistent with Q2. Our third quarter cash flows from operations were $545 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $324 million. From a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter approximately 1.3x and with cash balances of $1.1 billion. During Q3, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares for $203 million, and for the year, we've repurchased 7.9 million shares for $475 million as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Turning now to our fourth quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.5 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $3.9 billion. We expect total company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.7 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $390 million to $450 million, representing a core margin range of 4.8% to 5.2%. At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 80 basis points for the prior year. In Q4, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $367 million to $427 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.94 to $2.34. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $2.18. The core tax rate in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately 17%. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our dynamic and resilient portfolio of businesses by end market. Across the majority of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient and continues to outstrip supply across our business, particularly in end markets that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds. Markets such as Electric Vehicles, Personalized Medicine and Healthcare, Clean and Smart Energy Infrastructure, 5G Infrastructure, Cloud and Semi-Cap, these end markets represent a large majority of the overall Jabil portfolio today, and we believe sustained growth in these markets will continue even if overall global economic growth slows from the solid levels over the last few years. The end markets we serve that may be more susceptible to economic slowdowns have been strategically positioned within the portfolio as we partner with market-leading brands to provide key capabilities that are critical and hard to replicate. This product diversification provides resiliency to our portfolio. In summary, Jabil is not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient due to our multi-year proactive efforts to diversify our business and align to tomorrow's trends. As a result, we feel the outlook for our business is strong and anticipate demand to be resilient for the balance of this year and into FY '23. All in all, our performance during the first 9 months of FY '22 gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year. We're now anticipating core EPS will be in the neighborhood of $7.45 per share on revenue of approximately $32.8 billion. Notably, we see income and cash flow coming through with the increase to revenue. We now expect strong core margin and free cash flow of 4.6% and $700 million, respectively. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. Before we move into Q&A, I'd like to remind all participants that we cannot address customer or product-specific questions. Thank you for your understanding. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong execution in the quarter. My first question, Mark, is on revenue growth. Revenues in EMS, looks like it saw a much stronger growth than you had expected. Was there any pull forward of revenue from a fiscal 4Q? Or did you just see higher demand in all end markets? And the same question for the DMS segment, where revenue growth was 7% versus your guidance of 17%. Looks like you've reduced your estimate for fiscal year mobility and auto revenues a little bit. So do you see lower end market demand? Or is it that supply constraints are limiting your ability to fulfill the demand?\nMark Mondello: Ruplu, so those are, I think, two fundamental questions for the quarter, and there's a lot there. But if I missed something, bring me back to it. I'll start with DMS. DMS business overall, I think if you're looking at comps relative to what we thought we'd do at the beginning of the quarter, which is I think where you're indexing your numbers from, one, we're probably a little bit conservative in our guide at the beginning of the quarter with everything going on; number two, the execution through the quarter was exceptional, and it was really broad-based. So I know I used that term in other conversations as well. But if you take a look at -- maybe a good data point for you, if you go back and look at our blue green slide from March and you look at it, what we presented today, kind of the annual numbers on the EMS side are reflective of where we saw some strength and where our execution, I think, was exceptional for the year. So I think it's a combination of, A, a little bit conservative at the beginning of the quarter with everything going on. Number two, execution was great. There was a little bit of uptick in demand. And I don't know if I'd say pull forward, I would say that in this environment, customers are -- have a really good appreciation of our ability to help in the supply chain situations and navigating some continued supply chain issues. And I think that allowed us to pick up some share during the quarter. So that's kind of EMS. I also think on the EMS side, if I speak to it on a relative basis, Ruplu, I said something in my prepared remarks about the world being a little bit difficult at the moment. The EMS side of our business, we were saying internally, I think we did a good job controlling the controllables. And that's just what Jabil does really, really well at our scale is the execution side, whether it be the factory or supply chain. On the DMS side, I think it was threefold; one, it was a bit on health care; two, it was a bit on auto; and three, it was a bit on mobility. And although, again, we were somewhat conservative in our guide, we certainly didn't anticipate the length of time in terms of the shutdown in Shanghai. Although we're doing on a general basis, if you look at the enterprise results overall for the quarter and what's stacking up to be a very good year in a really tough environment, there were some challenges again with some specific silicon, probably impacted us mostly on auto, but not in a vacuum. And then there were some timing and shifts going on in volumes with mobility. So I would say that's kind of a summary of what happened with the results in terms of EMS and DMS in terms of our guide back in March.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Yes, thanks for all the details there Mark. That's helpful. And can I ask, given all the strengths that you're seeing in various EMS end markets and also in DMS, how should we think about CapEx this year? And which specific areas are you -- do you think you need to invest more in this year? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Well, this year's about over, so I -- CapEx is going to be what it's going to be this year. I think it will be, I don't know, somewhere between 2.5% and 3% of overall revenue. It's probably closer to 2.5%, and I think we talked about that back in September. So the way we're managing CapEx, I think, is exceptional. I actually have an opinion too on the fact that I think our overall capital allocation throughout the year has been quite good. We'll get into CapEx for FY '23 during the upcoming Investor Day in September. I would expect in terms of indexing CapEx off of revenue, FY '23 will look similar to FY '22. In terms of the last part of your question, we'll continue to invest in areas that have great cash flows, sustainable businesses and help drive our margins to 5%.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thanks for taking the question, and congrats again on the quarter.\nMark Mondello: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes. Thank you, and good morning. I just -- a question just regarding the guidance, and specifically on the margins. It looks like you're guiding margins to, call it, 5% or so? And is that driven by mix? Do you expect gross margin to improve here or continued OpEx leverage? And you're talking very strong leverage on OpEx in the last couple of quarters. So what is driving those margins?\nMark Mondello: Well, I think, one, it's -- again, it's a little bit of a mix across the business, which I think is a big thesis of our story around where the company is today. I think we see -- quarter-on-quarter, we'll see decent strength in Auto. I think we'll see, assuming Shanghai doesn't shut down hard again, we'll see relative strength in Healthcare and Packaging. Q4 always ends up being a strong quarter for us because of mix, not intentional on our EMS business, and the EMS business is substantial in the fourth quarter. And I think if I step back and I look at the bigger picture, it's the overall health of the business and it's the overall execution. I mean, I think Q4 is a good marker for the business on where we want to take it further for '23 and '24, again, in driving the entire enterprise on an annual basis to 5% op margins.\nMike Dastoor: And Matt, if I could just add. DMS and EMS businesses have slightly different gross margin profiles. I think the EMS, which outperformed in Q3, which will have a good quarter in Q4 as well. The gross margin can be low, but the SG&A OpEx can be lower as well and vice versa. On the DMS side, where your gross margin is higher, but your SG&A percentages are higher because of FDA qualification requirements because of regulated industries, sort of the regulations that go around that. So it's a very different gross margin profile for EMS and DMS. I would encourage folks to look at operating margin. That's what we, as a management team, look at internally. We're marching towards 5% and beyond, and we'll continue to deliver that. Gross margin profiles will go change up and down quarter-by-quarter depending on the mix, so I just encourage you to focus more on operating margin than gross margin.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thank you for that. And then regarding the supply chain headwinds that hit most of your DMS businesses. Are you seeing any signs of easing there, either on the semiconductor supply side or the COVID-related restrictions? And how is that impacting your guidance? In other words, would you have even more upside if there were more available supply or production?\nMark Mondello: I've been saying this the last couple of quarters. First off, there was multiple variables that impacted DMS, and by the way, demand remains strong. So I think that's an interesting takeaway from this call. And our -- the DMS delta relative to our guide wasn't all supply chain at all. Again, it was a timing and shift in volumes in mobility. It was, again, the number of weeks of our shutdown in Shanghai. And then I did say and acknowledge that we had some issues with some very specialized silicon, and that impacted probably auto more than other end markets. But I think -- I continue to think that as a whole across the company, our supply chain challenges are getting better, the overall supply chain is getting better. And I'll caveat that as I did, I think, in the March call and the December call, which is when we think about supply chain, it's not just semiconductors. It's not just the last golden screw. We have everything from resins to metals in our precision machining to just run the gamut of everything that we buy. So again, I think supply chain continues to get better. I thought and have said that I thought supply chain normalizes towards the end of this calendar year. That may push a bit into '23. But overall, A, supply chains are getting a bit better. There's still some hard constraints around some select components. But I would also say that one of the things that played for us in the third quarter and is also helping us drive the 5% margins in the fourth quarter is our ability to navigate supply chain on a relative basis better than most.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Thanks so much for the answer.\nMark Mondello: Yes. Thanks Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good morning. Two questions, if I could. First of all, when you think -- I know you don't want to give too much on next year, but your operating margins are up 80 basis points year-over-year. I think you mentioned some of that was because of mix. Can you just sort of talk about how much more is left in terms of improving margins just based on your sales mix? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: You're right. We don't want to say much about '23 at the moment. I think we'll go deep into that, Steve, in our Investor Day in September. I just -- I guess I'd look at it and say a few years back, we ran about a 6-year stretch where we were growing the heck out of the company and diversifying and building the platform we have today, and the op margin line was around 3.5%. And then in '21, we took it up substantially to 4.2%. This year, we're going to deliver around 4.6%. I guess I would say, and maybe I alluded to some of this in my prepared remarks is I think, sitting here today, I think FY '23 margins will be greater than FY '22's margins. And I think Q4 is a little bit of a proxy in terms of kind of where the company is headed. So overall, there's a lot of things going on around us at the moment. We're navigating them reasonably well on an absolute scale, I think, very well on a relative scale. So more to come in September.\nSteven Fox: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned some market share gains on some of the more mature product areas. I'm just curious if there's any other color you can provide on that? And do we think about that as being sustainable? Or were you feeling sort of an interim gap? And before I forget, I guess I'll wish the Lightning luck in the rest of the Stanley Cup finals.\nMark Mondello: I was hoping you were going to say that. You know what, your Rangers are an awfully good team, and I think they're going to be really, really good the next three to four years. So thanks for that. And we're rooting them on. They had a tough loss last night, but we appreciate the -- we appreciate the Ranger fan converting to a Lightning fan at least for the next couple of weeks. Thank you. On the share gain, I would -- I don't know how to handicap that. We did a number of customers some favors by navigating supply chain and helping them out when they needed some help. Is that sustainable? I don't know. Some of it will be, some of it won't. I do think though, if you take a look at the blue green slide, and I know the one that we post in the deck kind of gives you relativity FY '20, FY '21, FY '22. But if you pull the blue green slide out of your last deck from the March call and you take a look at what we said in March versus where we sit today, again, for the year -- I think I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think Digital Print Retail is up from what we said 90 days ago. 5G Wireless and Cloud is up from what we said 90 days ago, Networking & Storage. So I think that's a good proxy of where we picked up some share, again, largely around our ability to execute supply chain and getting product factories for customers. Will some of that stick with us? I think so, and I think you'll hear about some of that in September.\nSteven Fox: Thanks again.\nMark Mondello: Yes, you're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Delaney: Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. The first one is on the macroeconomic environment. And Mark, you commented on some of these uncertain headlines that are out there. And I'm curious, is this just something you guys are seeing in terms of the economic data points that are being reported? Or are there actual customer schedules for 6 to 12 months out that are starting to slow? And if there are actual customers that are indicating things may be slowing? Are there any end markets you can point to?\nMark Mondello: Well, I'm not going to get into customer data. I would say that -- I would say what's good news is if we go back to -- so again, the world is a tough place, and it's a tough place for any large corporation at the moment. But boy, I like our chances. If you go back in a tough environment with everything, I think in September, if I remember right, we thought the year would be like $31.5 billion or something like that, and now we're up at $32.8 billion. So again, I think that's reflective of our ability to execute in a tough environment. And again, I think it speaks to how we're positioned with the portfolio we have. In terms of what -- we always see puts and takes, are some of those puts and takes maybe, I don't know, peak to trough -- peak to trough? Are some of those may be more abrupt in an environment like this? Maybe. But again, as I step back and I look at -- if you take our current guide and look where the year is going to end up, I feel pretty good about the year overall, so. And I think the other thing we've been talking about, and I think it gets way over spoken on earnings calls and people talk about secular this and secular that. But what I think is very real is we have some wonderful opportunities for '23 and '24 that have started to come through the P&L this year. And we talked about Electric Vehicles, we talked about Personalized Healthcare, we talk about some of the changes and advancements in connected devices. I think about what's going on in terms of Automation and the retail space. I think about what's going on with new fabs being built in our Semi-Cap business, I think about what's going on in the 5G build-out. So they're certainly not -- those types of businesses, if we get into a massive recession, will have impact to the negative. But all things being equal, when you look at those businesses, and then I also think about how we've refined and improved what you might think of as our more legacy business. All in all, I feel good about the fourth quarter. And again, I think we'll have some reasonably good things to say in September.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. My second question is on the China region, and we're seeing some headlines of business resuming post some of these shutdowns in different parts of China. Could you better characterize to what extent things are back open, maybe relative to March when Shanghai, for example, went into lockdown? To what extent are things back to those sorts of levels? Or is it still 70%, 80%? And if it's not back at full volumes, when do you think you may be back to full volumes in China? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: I think we'll be back to full volumes in China now. And we've handicapped that a little bit in the fourth quarter, but our assumption is that China runs at, say, let's -- let me just -- let me say something to you illustratively and don't pay too much attention to the numbers, but you'll get what I'm trying to say. If you take our overall China capacity, and let's just say that we assume that that capacity is going to run at 80%, 85%. When things do get shut down or things go bump in the night, we have enough residual capacity there, if you will, to make things up pretty quickly. I would say for 4Q, we're assuming that our capacity is going to run at 80%, 85%, and all indications are that's a good assumption set. And things -- we're not assuming things will be quite as difficult as they were in Q3. By the way, I think that's also a variable in why the margins Q3 to Q4 are up.\nMark Delaney: That's very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on the good results.\nMark Mondello: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So just on free cash flow, pretty steady guidance here despite tough macro backdrop. Talk about some of the puts and takes there on offsetting some heavy investments in inventory? And then you mentioned some normalization later this year, but are you expecting some structural step ups here on working cap offers maybe moving forward?\nMike Dastoor: So Paul, thanks for that question. I think if you look at our earnings, earnings are up -- it's up from the beginning of the year. It's up again quarter-over-quarter. I think the inventory number was slightly higher than what we expected. Working capital was up a little bit. I think the reasons for those are very clear. It's a complex sort of supply chain, the COVID shutdowns didn't help. But overall, we still feel we can get to our free cash flow number. We will see some reduction in working capital in Q4. In fact, if you look at our free cash flow this year versus last year, at this point in time, we're actually ahead of what we were last year. So I feel good about that $700 million free cash flow number, Paul.\nPaul Chung: Great. And then just a follow-up on the automation side. So where are you seeing kind of incremental opportunities for CapEx and M&A to kind of enhance the firm's capabilities? It seems like you have some momentum here at Badger from what I can see. I know that part of the business is small, but how are you kind of leveraging some robotics technology across the business? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: I think we're doing a really good job of that. One of the things that we spend a lot of time internal about is, A, control what we can control. And if you think about our business, at the very, very core of our business is we build stuff, and it's that simple. And if we're going to build stuff, we should have the best factories in the world. I would say of our overall factory network today, we're really, really proud of about 80% of our factories, and we got 20% of the factories that operate really well, so far from perfect. But also, I would say the OpEx investments we've made along with the CapEx investments both in IT, operations, automation, AI, data analytics, et cetera, are starting to come through in the factories. And we think that will carry through for '23 and '24. And I think overall, we're going to be able to continue to do more with less. And I think that's also reflected in our overall SG&A numbers as well, which I think is a good thing.\nPaul Chung: Great. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes, you're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Adam Berry for closing remarks.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, everyone, for joining. This now concludes our call.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for the tireless attention you offer our customers, and thank you for the manner in which you care for and accept one another. Let's now turn to Slide 5 and review our third quarter results. Q3 was another strong quarter driven by double-digit revenue growth and outstanding execution. Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.72 and revenue of $8.3 billion. This resulted in a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 40 basis point increase year-on-year. All in all, I'm quite pleased with the quarter. We're carrying good momentum as we start to think about FY '23. And when I think about momentum, I think about the primary catalysts behind our business, that being the makeup and scale of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide, Slide 6. The pie chart shown here reflects Jabil's commercial portfolio, which our team has built over the past five to six years, in essence, a large-scale, well-diversified foundation from which we run our business today. And the resulting output in having built this business is threefold. One, a higher level of resiliency for the corporation. Either during trying times of macro and geopolitical disruptions or during more typical times when we're simply faced with never-ending demand fluctuations. Two, Jabil's presence in new markets. Markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing and clean energy. Markets that we believe will drive earnings growth, especially when combined with the continued refinement and improvement of our traditional businesses. And finally, the third resultant output of our team's hard work is the assembly and collection of our many capabilities. Capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified. Moving to Slide 7. You'll see management's outlook for the year. We're anticipating core earnings per share to be $7.45, an increase of 33% year-on-year. As for revenue, fiscal '22 now looks to be $32.8 billion, while our outlook for core operating margin remains steady at 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year. In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for FY '22. Altogether, this year is a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows. And although we're navigating a tough environment, we have ample opportunities to consider as we formalize our business plan for fiscal '23. With this in mind, we look forward to hosting our fifth Annual Investor Briefing. And consistent with past years, the briefing will be held in late September. Adam will be confirming an exact date later this summer. We'll open the session by reporting our fourth quarter and full year results, we'll then follow with a complete review of our priorities and explain how these priorities will guide us through FY '23. Management will also share how we plan to further expand our core operating margin while sharing observations on end markets. In wrapping up the September session, Mike will share our capital return framework for FY '23 and FY '24. We have lots to share and a wonderful story to tell financially, operationally and commercially. With that, let's look at my final slide, where I'd like to talk about the importance of purpose. At Jabil, we act with purpose, and with purpose comes expectations. Expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, protecting the environment, giving back to our communities and ensuring a workplace of tolerance, respect and acceptance. Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been as important as they are today. I'm proud of our team as they embrace our purpose, and in doing so, their conduct is exceptional. In closing, I like the decisions we're making. At Jabil, we build stuff, and we do it really, really well. It's why we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. And when addressing these challenges, we do our best to make the world a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer each and every day. As I alluded to earlier in my prepared remarks, the world is a bit messy at the moment. What I do believe is Jabil executes well when times are steady, but I'm even more passionate in my belief that Jabil executes really well when times are difficult. Thank you for joining our call, and thanks for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Ruplu, so those are, I think, two fundamental questions for the quarter, and there's a lot there. But if I missed something, bring me back to it. I'll start with DMS. DMS business overall, I think if you're looking at comps relative to what we thought we'd do at the beginning of the quarter, which is I think where you're indexing your numbers from, one, we're probably a little bit conservative in our guide at the beginning of the quarter with everything going on; number two, the execution through the quarter was exceptional, and it was really broad-based. So I know I used that term in other conversations as well. But if you take a look at -- maybe a good data point for you, if you go back and look at our blue green slide from March and you look at it, what we presented today, kind of the annual numbers on the EMS side are reflective of where we saw some strength and where our execution, I think, was exceptional for the year. So I think it's a combination of, A, a little bit conservative at the beginning of the quarter with everything going on. Number two, execution was great. There was a little bit of uptick in demand. And I don't know if I'd say pull forward, I would say that in this environment, customers are -- have a really good appreciation of our ability to help in the supply chain situations and navigating some continued supply chain issues. And I think that allowed us to pick up some share during the quarter. So that's kind of EMS. I also think on the EMS side, if I speak to it on a relative basis, Ruplu, I said something in my prepared remarks about the world being a little bit difficult at the moment. The EMS side of our business, we were saying internally, I think we did a good job controlling the controllables. And that's just what Jabil does really, really well at our scale is the execution side, whether it be the factory or supply chain. On the DMS side, I think it was threefold; one, it was a bit on health care; two, it was a bit on auto; and three, it was a bit on mobility. And although, again, we were somewhat conservative in our guide, we certainly didn't anticipate the length of time in terms of the shutdown in Shanghai. Although we're doing on a general basis, if you look at the enterprise results overall for the quarter and what's stacking up to be a very good year in a really tough environment, there were some challenges again with some specific silicon, probably impacted us mostly on auto, but not in a vacuum. And then there were some timing and shifts going on in volumes with mobility. So I would say that's kind of a summary of what happened with the results in terms of EMS and DMS in terms of our guide back in March. Well, this year's about over, so I -- CapEx is going to be what it's going to be this year. I think it will be, I don't know, somewhere between 2.5% and 3% of overall revenue. It's probably closer to 2.5%, and I think we talked about that back in September. So the way we're managing CapEx, I think, is exceptional. I actually have an opinion too on the fact that I think our overall capital allocation throughout the year has been quite good. We'll get into CapEx for FY '23 during the upcoming Investor Day in September. I would expect in terms of indexing CapEx off of revenue, FY '23 will look similar to FY '22. In terms of the last part of your question, we'll continue to invest in areas that have great cash flows, sustainable businesses and help drive our margins to 5%. Thank you. Well, I think, one, it's -- again, it's a little bit of a mix across the business, which I think is a big thesis of our story around where the company is today. I think we see -- quarter-on-quarter, we'll see decent strength in Auto. I think we'll see, assuming Shanghai doesn't shut down hard again, we'll see relative strength in Healthcare and Packaging. Q4 always ends up being a strong quarter for us because of mix, not intentional on our EMS business, and the EMS business is substantial in the fourth quarter. And I think if I step back and I look at the bigger picture, it's the overall health of the business and it's the overall execution. I mean, I think Q4 is a good marker for the business on where we want to take it further for '23 and '24, again, in driving the entire enterprise on an annual basis to 5% op margins. I've been saying this the last couple of quarters. First off, there was multiple variables that impacted DMS, and by the way, demand remains strong. So I think that's an interesting takeaway from this call. And our -- the DMS delta relative to our guide wasn't all supply chain at all. Again, it was a timing and shift in volumes in mobility. It was, again, the number of weeks of our shutdown in Shanghai. And then I did say and acknowledge that we had some issues with some very specialized silicon, and that impacted probably auto more than other end markets. But I think -- I continue to think that as a whole across the company, our supply chain challenges are getting better, the overall supply chain is getting better. And I'll caveat that as I did, I think, in the March call and the December call, which is when we think about supply chain, it's not just semiconductors. It's not just the last golden screw. We have everything from resins to metals in our precision machining to just run the gamut of everything that we buy. So again, I think supply chain continues to get better. I thought and have said that I thought supply chain normalizes towards the end of this calendar year. That may push a bit into '23. But overall, A, supply chains are getting a bit better. There's still some hard constraints around some select components. But I would also say that one of the things that played for us in the third quarter and is also helping us drive the 5% margins in the fourth quarter is our ability to navigate supply chain on a relative basis better than most. Yes. Thanks Matt. You're right. We don't want to say much about '23 at the moment. I think we'll go deep into that, Steve, in our Investor Day in September. I just -- I guess I'd look at it and say a few years back, we ran about a 6-year stretch where we were growing the heck out of the company and diversifying and building the platform we have today, and the op margin line was around 3.5%. And then in '21, we took it up substantially to 4.2%. This year, we're going to deliver around 4.6%. I guess I would say, and maybe I alluded to some of this in my prepared remarks is I think, sitting here today, I think FY '23 margins will be greater than FY '22's margins. And I think Q4 is a little bit of a proxy in terms of kind of where the company is headed. So overall, there's a lot of things going on around us at the moment. We're navigating them reasonably well on an absolute scale, I think, very well on a relative scale. So more to come in September. I was hoping you were going to say that. You know what, your Rangers are an awfully good team, and I think they're going to be really, really good the next three to four years. So thanks for that. And we're rooting them on. They had a tough loss last night, but we appreciate the -- we appreciate the Ranger fan converting to a Lightning fan at least for the next couple of weeks. Thank you. On the share gain, I would -- I don't know how to handicap that. We did a number of customers some favors by navigating supply chain and helping them out when they needed some help. Is that sustainable? I don't know. Some of it will be, some of it won't. I do think though, if you take a look at the blue green slide, and I know the one that we post in the deck kind of gives you relativity FY '20, FY '21, FY '22. But if you pull the blue green slide out of your last deck from the March call and you take a look at what we said in March versus where we sit today, again, for the year -- I think I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think Digital Print Retail is up from what we said 90 days ago. 5G Wireless and Cloud is up from what we said 90 days ago, Networking & Storage. So I think that's a good proxy of where we picked up some share, again, largely around our ability to execute supply chain and getting product factories for customers. Will some of that stick with us? I think so, and I think you'll hear about some of that in September. Yes, you're welcome. Well, I'm not going to get into customer data. I would say that -- I would say what's good news is if we go back to -- so again, the world is a tough place, and it's a tough place for any large corporation at the moment. But boy, I like our chances. If you go back in a tough environment with everything, I think in September, if I remember right, we thought the year would be like $31.5 billion or something like that, and now we're up at $32.8 billion. So again, I think that's reflective of our ability to execute in a tough environment. And again, I think it speaks to how we're positioned with the portfolio we have. In terms of what -- we always see puts and takes, are some of those puts and takes maybe, I don't know, peak to trough -- peak to trough? Are some of those may be more abrupt in an environment like this? Maybe. But again, as I step back and I look at -- if you take our current guide and look where the year is going to end up, I feel pretty good about the year overall, so. And I think the other thing we've been talking about, and I think it gets way over spoken on earnings calls and people talk about secular this and secular that. But what I think is very real is we have some wonderful opportunities for '23 and '24 that have started to come through the P&L this year. And we talked about Electric Vehicles, we talked about Personalized Healthcare, we talk about some of the changes and advancements in connected devices. I think about what's going on in terms of Automation and the retail space. I think about what's going on with new fabs being built in our Semi-Cap business, I think about what's going on in the 5G build-out. So they're certainly not -- those types of businesses, if we get into a massive recession, will have impact to the negative. But all things being equal, when you look at those businesses, and then I also think about how we've refined and improved what you might think of as our more legacy business. All in all, I feel good about the fourth quarter. And again, I think we'll have some reasonably good things to say in September. I think we'll be back to full volumes in China now. And we've handicapped that a little bit in the fourth quarter, but our assumption is that China runs at, say, let's -- let me just -- let me say something to you illustratively and don't pay too much attention to the numbers, but you'll get what I'm trying to say. If you take our overall China capacity, and let's just say that we assume that that capacity is going to run at 80%, 85%. When things do get shut down or things go bump in the night, we have enough residual capacity there, if you will, to make things up pretty quickly. I would say for 4Q, we're assuming that our capacity is going to run at 80%, 85%, and all indications are that's a good assumption set. And things -- we're not assuming things will be quite as difficult as they were in Q3. By the way, I think that's also a variable in why the margins Q3 to Q4 are up. Thank you. I think we're doing a really good job of that. One of the things that we spend a lot of time internal about is, A, control what we can control. And if you think about our business, at the very, very core of our business is we build stuff, and it's that simple. And if we're going to build stuff, we should have the best factories in the world. I would say of our overall factory network today, we're really, really proud of about 80% of our factories, and we got 20% of the factories that operate really well, so far from perfect. But also, I would say the OpEx investments we've made along with the CapEx investments both in IT, operations, automation, AI, data analytics, et cetera, are starting to come through in the factories. And we think that will carry through for '23 and '24. And I think overall, we're going to be able to continue to do more with less. And I think that's also reflected in our overall SG&A numbers as well, which I think is a good thing. Yes, you're welcome."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was a great illustration of our diversification in action. I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the sustainable momentum at the enterprise level. In spite of a challenging supply chain environment and well-publicized shutdowns in China, the team still delivered exceptional results in revenue, core operating margin and core diluted earnings per share. For the quarter, revenue was approximately $8.3 billion, ahead of our forecast, driven by very strong demand within EMS, partially offset by sporadic COVID challenges within DMS. Altogether, on enterprise level, revenue grew by 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially as demand across end markets remain well ahead of supply. In Q3, our GAAP operating income was $321 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.52. Core operating income during the quarter was $352 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q3 came in above expectations at $45 million due to a combination of higher working capital and rising interest rates. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.72, a 32% improvement over the prior year quarter. Now turning to our third quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 7% on a year-over-year basis. Although upside in the quarter was limited in automotive, healthcare and mobility, we still experienced year-over-year growth in every end market within DMS. Core margin for the segment came in at 3.8%. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.5 billion, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis and well ahead of our plans for March. The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was extremely broad-based, with strength in our 5G Wireless & Cloud and Networking & Storage businesses, where we gained additional share during the quarter. As a result, our ability to execute in complex supply chains and deliver critical parts and components. Core margin for the segment was 4.6%, up 80 basis points for the prior year, reflecting exceptional cost control on higher-than-anticipated revenue. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q3, inventory days came in at 85 days, down one day sequentially and above our expectations in March, mainly due to the shutdowns in Shanghai which also impacted upstream and downstream supply chains. We offset a portion of higher inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of inventory deposits, inventory days were 70 in Q3, down one day from the previous quarter. As a quick reminder, our business model is designed such that we do not take risk on inventory in anticipation of sales. All inventory orders require a customer purchase order before triggering a purchase request within our MRP system. Majority of our inventory continues to be mainly associated with raw materials as a result of kicking issues and timing of components. At the end of Q3, finished goods represented a very small level at approximately 11% of inventory consistent with Q2. Our third quarter cash flows from operations were $545 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $324 million. From a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter approximately 1.3x and with cash balances of $1.1 billion. During Q3, we repurchased approximately 0.6 million shares for $203 million, and for the year, we've repurchased 7.9 million shares for $475 million as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. Turning now to our fourth quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.5 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $3.9 billion. We expect total company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.7 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $390 million to $450 million, representing a core margin range of 4.8% to 5.2%. At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 80 basis points for the prior year. In Q4, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $367 million to $427 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.94 to $2.34. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $2.18. The core tax rate in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately 17%. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our dynamic and resilient portfolio of businesses by end market. Across the majority of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient and continues to outstrip supply across our business, particularly in end markets that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds. Markets such as Electric Vehicles, Personalized Medicine and Healthcare, Clean and Smart Energy Infrastructure, 5G Infrastructure, Cloud and Semi-Cap, these end markets represent a large majority of the overall Jabil portfolio today, and we believe sustained growth in these markets will continue even if overall global economic growth slows from the solid levels over the last few years. The end markets we serve that may be more susceptible to economic slowdowns have been strategically positioned within the portfolio as we partner with market-leading brands to provide key capabilities that are critical and hard to replicate. This product diversification provides resiliency to our portfolio. In summary, Jabil is not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient due to our multi-year proactive efforts to diversify our business and align to tomorrow's trends. As a result, we feel the outlook for our business is strong and anticipate demand to be resilient for the balance of this year and into FY '23. All in all, our performance during the first 9 months of FY '22 gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year. We're now anticipating core EPS will be in the neighborhood of $7.45 per share on revenue of approximately $32.8 billion. Notably, we see income and cash flow coming through with the increase to revenue. We now expect strong core margin and free cash flow of 4.6% and $700 million, respectively. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam. And Matt, if I could just add. DMS and EMS businesses have slightly different gross margin profiles. I think the EMS, which outperformed in Q3, which will have a good quarter in Q4 as well. The gross margin can be low, but the SG&A OpEx can be lower as well and vice versa. On the DMS side, where your gross margin is higher, but your SG&A percentages are higher because of FDA qualification requirements because of regulated industries, sort of the regulations that go around that. So it's a very different gross margin profile for EMS and DMS. I would encourage folks to look at operating margin. That's what we, as a management team, look at internally. We're marching towards 5% and beyond, and we'll continue to deliver that. Gross margin profiles will go change up and down quarter-by-quarter depending on the mix, so I just encourage you to focus more on operating margin than gross margin. So Paul, thanks for that question. I think if you look at our earnings, earnings are up -- it's up from the beginning of the year. It's up again quarter-over-quarter. I think the inventory number was slightly higher than what we expected. Working capital was up a little bit. I think the reasons for those are very clear. It's a complex sort of supply chain, the COVID shutdowns didn't help. But overall, we still feel we can get to our free cash flow number. We will see some reduction in working capital in Q4. In fact, if you look at our free cash flow this year versus last year, at this point in time, we're actually ahead of what we were last year. So I feel good about that $700 million free cash flow number, Paul."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAdam Berry: Good morning and welcome to Jabil\u2019s second quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today\u2019s call is being webcast live and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today\u2019s call, the entirety of today's session will be posted for audio playback on our Web site.  I'd like to now ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the Web site, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'd now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. To begin with, our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the war in Ukraine. When I think about our team, along with their families, what comes to mind are words like admiration, courage and heart. Please know we're in constant communication with those on the ground.  And we continue to provide resources and financial assistance as the safety and security of those in Ukraine is our top priority. At Jabil, we're one corporate family with people located all over the world. And despite the physical distance between us, we'll always face difficult situations together. To all of our employees, thank you for being servant leaders, thank you for your spirit and thank you for looking after one another.  Let's now turn to Slide 6, where we'll take a look at our second quarter results. Q2 was another strong quarter, both top line and bottom line, driven by double digit revenue growth year-on-year and exceptional execution, respectively. Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.68 on revenue of $7.6 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase year-on-year.  All-in-all, I'm pleased with the quarter as our performance during the first half of the year gives us positive momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '22 and into fiscal '23. And when I think about a key catalyst driving our momentum, what comes to mind is the makeup of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide.  Slide 7 is a wonderful picture which shows the construct of our portfolio today. Jabil's large scale diversification serves as a solid foundation from which we run our business. The team has built this foundation over the past five to six years as we target new end markets and optimize our legacy business.  The output of this effort is twofold; one, a higher level of resiliency across the company and two, a substantial presence in secular end markets. Markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.  If we dissect the pie chart a bit differently, with an emphasis on financial contribution and economic relevance, we see a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows. Again, a real tribute to the diversified nature of our business today. Lastly, if we look at a third dimension of our portfolio, we find a library of essential capabilities; capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands. And when done correctly, our unique set of capabilities offer Jabil a real competitive advantage, as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.  Moving on to Slide 8, you'll see management's outlook for the year. We've increased core earnings per share to $7.25, an increase of nearly 30% year-on-year. As for revenue, FY '22 now looks to be in the range of $32.6 billion, up more than 10% year-on-year.  In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year, while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year. For me, this is a positive testament on how the team is managing the business, as our strategy has been consistent and what needs to be done is well understood throughout our company.  With that, let's move to my final slide where I'd like to start with the importance of our purpose. At Jabil, with purpose comes expectations; expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, protecting the environment, giving back to our communities and offering a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance.  Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been more important than they are today. I'm proud of our team as they fully grasp our purpose. And in doing so, their conduct is exceptional. In closing, our improvement is steady, commercially, financially and operationally. Quite simply, here at Jabil we build stuff and we do it really well.  One factor that makes good companies great is having a value set, a culture, if you will, that enhances the way in which they solve problems. As a team, we embrace this as we take on the challenges put forth by our customers each and every day. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making the Jabil Jabil.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us today. I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our diversified portfolio and the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, as several of our end markets continue to benefit from long-term secular trends. As Mark just summarized, our Q2 results were very strong. During the quarter, revenue, core operating income, core EPS and free cash flow, all exceeded our December expectations.  Given the higher revenue, I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive an extra 30 basis points of margin improvement compared to our expectations in December, mainly through broad-based trends in several key end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends, as well as outstanding execution by our business, operations and supply chain teams. For the quarter, revenue was approximately $7.6 billion, up 10.6% over the prior year quarter and ahead of the midpoint of our guidance from December. The additional upside was mainly driven by our 5G and cloud businesses, while our automotive, healthcare and retail end markets remained very strong.  Our GAAP operating income during the quarter was $313 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51. Core operating income during the quarter was $344 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.6%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.68, a 32% improvement over the prior year quarter.  Now, turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. The solid year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and connected devices businesses. Core margin for the segment came in at 5.1%.  Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.8 billion, an increase of 19% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad based with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap and 5G wireless and cloud businesses. Core margin for the segment was 4%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting improvements and solid execution by the team. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q2, inventory days came in at 86 days. The sequential increase in days was driven largely by two factors. Firstly, the ongoing tightness in the supply chain continues to weigh on our inventory balances. It's worth noting that we've offset a portion of these increases with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of these inventory deposits, inventory days was 71 in Q2.  And second, at the end of the quarter, we experienced a timing difference on the sell-through of finished goods within our DMS segment. I anticipate this timing difference to reverse in Q3. In spite of these two factors impacting inventory, our second quarter cash flows from operations were very robust coming in at $246 million and net capital expenditures totaled $201 million.  From a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter at approximately 1.3x and with cash balances of $1.1 billion. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $145 million. And for the year, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $272 million as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.  Turning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 17% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.2 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4 billion. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $300 million to $360 million, representing a core margin range of 3.8% to 4.2%. At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 20 basis points over the prior year and down sequentially reflecting planned investments in our Q3 quarter.  It's also worth noting, sequentially in Q4, we expect robust core margins driven by our scaling automotive business, along with typical seasonality in our mobility and EMS businesses. In Q3, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $276 million to $336 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.64. The core tax rate in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 21%. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, the outlook for our business is strong, with end markets across both segments continuing to benefit from multiyear secular trends. We believe these markets will continue to drive our growth as we concentrate our efforts on long-term secular growth markets with strong margins and cash flow dynamics.  Markets such as electric vehicles, personalized medicine and healthcare, semi-cap, clean and smart energy infrastructure, cloud, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices. Our electric vehicle business in particular continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates.  We've seen this rapid acceleration manifested in top line revenue growth in excess of 50% this year alone in our automotive end market. We're also expecting double digit growth for the healthcare, automotive, retail, industrial and semi-cap and 5G wireless and cloud end markets. And importantly, the broad-based growth associated with the secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin and free cash flow expansion.  All-in-all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year. We're now anticipating core EPS will be in the neighborhood of $7.25 per share on revenue of approximately $32.6 billion. Notably, this incremental revenue will improve mix and drive operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.6% for FY '22, as we continue to drive the organization to 5% and beyond.  Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating in excess of $700 million in free cash flow in spite of the higher revenue and associated working capital. We've been working extremely hard as a team to expand margins and drive strong cash flows. I'm very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. Before we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind our participants that we cannot address customer-specific or product-specific questions. Thanks. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Congratulations on the results and extremely strong outlook, despite all the uncertainty in the world. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of confidence or conviction about the operating margins and sustainability. Of course, your full year guidance increase is so big you have to assume the operating margins continue to see the strength. So I'm just curious, is that due to mix or the location and visibility from customer contracts that you're getting or the value added or maybe a combination of all, but if you could just pontificate a little bit on operating margins and your confidence in the sustainability of them? Thank you so much.\nMark Mondello: Hi, Jim. I think the overall margin profile, if you just go back to, let's say, pre-COVID to fiscal '19, we were running the business at around 3.5% margins. And our focus at that point in time was really about reshaping the overall portfolio and a big focus on diversification in both top line and bottom line. I think the team did a really nice job of that over a four, five-year period. And then starting in fiscal '21, so last year, we really started taking that portfolio at scale and focusing hard on the margin side of the business, largely around costs and optimization, while still being what I think is very competitive in the marketplace in terms of our pricing. This year, we've taken margins up. I think September, we said margins would go up to 4.5% from the 4.2% last year. And then this morning, we're taking it up another 10 basis points to 4.6% for the year. I think the main catalyst driving it is our execution has been outstanding and I think sustainable. I think the overall platform around the operational network, the tools, our IT systems also sustainable, and the advances we've made there are terrific. And then lastly, and maybe most importantly is, is just the overall portfolio that we have, Jim, when we think about how diverse we are, when we think about the contributions of the business, we look at the blend between automotive and transportation, healthcare, connected device, mobility, digital print, retail, industrial, cloud, 5G, networking, semi-cap, et cetera. It's just a wonderful, wonderful book of business today. We think that will continue to scale. And as I said, at some point in the last 18 months or so, I really believe as this business continues to get beyond $35 billion, $37 billion, $40 billion, we're going to effort internally to run the business at five points of margin on the operating line.\nJim Suva: Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two questions, if I could. First of all, just building off of that last answer, Mark, can you help us conceptualize a little bit how you're growing at scales so quickly, the challenges there given the global footprint that you have and managing the programs into, like we're talking about 8%, 10% growth off of $30 billion, $35 billion type of sales base? And then secondly, how is your global footprint? Maybe a better way to ask this, can you give us an update on your global footprint and how maybe it's changing versus what you would have thought six or nine months ago? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Okay, there's a lot. Let me try to break that out. So if I think about growth at scale, which I think was the first part of your question, I think -- I'd break that up to say, one, the team as we went through, diversified the company and really were able to step back once we got to what I'd maybe call significant scale. The team, call it a little bit of luck, call it some good planning, call it a lot of thoughtfulness, we have really, really been fortunate to get into some, like really substantial, very real secular markets. And I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about things like electric vehicles, personalized health, cloud computing, clean energy, et cetera. So strategically, the way we run strategy in the company is not so much top down, but through each of our sectors. And that's where our experts are. So the last two, three, four years, we've done a really nice job of placing our bets from a revenue perspective into some pretty powerful secular trends. That's number one. Number two is, we continue to pick up market share. So sometimes it's always difficult when people are trying to triangulate our numbers to current macro situations because what ends up getting left behind is, is the market share gains. And I think in my prepared remarks today, I think I used a term like massive. The market's massive and there's always going to be a need for things to be built and supply chains to be reconstructed. And we're pretty good at both of those things. And then lastly, is just the continued growth that we've seen, what I'd say more of our core legacy business has been strong over the last 18, 24 months. So I would say those are the catalysts. I don't foresee the company -- as we get to $35 billion, $37 billion, $40 billion, I wouldn't imagine the company is going to continue to grow strong double digits. But at least, as we look at the horizon, I think the company is going to grow nonetheless over the next three to five years for sure. In terms of footprint, our footprint's exceptional. And whether we look at cutting Southeast Asia, China, Europe, Brazil, Mexico, U.S., again, when I -- this common theme -- and I know it sounds redundant, but this common theme around diversification, we think about diversification in so many different ways and a subset of that is certainly our overall global footprint. Today, our big focus, economics aside, of course, is our footprint in Eastern Europe. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our hearts go out to everyone there at the moment on the ground, because what they're going through is horrific. And that's where a lot of our thoughts and time are spent over the last couple of weeks. But of all the things I worry about, or said differently, the things I feel good about on our footprint, I feel very, very good about where our footprint is today, Steve.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's really helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll build on some of the prior questions and say that Jabil's performance this quarter is impressive and you raising the guide annual by 800 million, $0.70 is impressive given what's happening with the supply chain and logistics costs and oil prices and geopolitical stuff. So can I ask you maybe what gives you the most concern when you look into the second half of this year, fiscal 22? And what happened in the past 90 days that is giving you confidence to raise the annual guide, or was your prior guidance just too conservative?\nMark Mondello: Yes, I'm hesitating because I'm thinking. I'm always concerned about a lot of things all the time. There's a war going on. And obviously, that's a concern. And for me that concern is, this will be the third time I'll say it, right, is really about the well being and the safety and security of our people. And I don't know how to say this. But in terms of a pure financial economic perspective, that doesn't give me a lot of concern. Saying that though, I do want to emphasize it's a bit heartbreaking to me and very emotional with that situation over there. And it has our full attention. So I would say supply chains, we tend to navigate that as good as anybody at the moment. Does that give me concern through the rest of the fiscal year? Maybe. A collapse in the macro in the very near term? Not so much. Inflation? I think we're managing that quite well. And I would say, I don't know, there's been a dust up here recently with some more COVID issues in Mainland China. And Ruplu, I would say we've been dealing with that literally like firsthand since the issues in Wuhan in January of 2020. And when I think about our campuses and places like Wuxi and Weihai and Huangpu and Shenzhen and Shanghai and Tianjin and Chengdu, we got a great team over there. We've been navigating that quite well. So as we think about the balance of the year and maybe first part of '23, as we sit today as a management team, we got pretty good confidence in the guide for the balance of the year and the beginning outlook for '23.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that, Mark. Can I ask about maybe if you can give us an update on your capital allocation priorities? Specifically, when I look in the past, you've focused on smaller tuck-in M&A. But given valuations have pulled back, do you see the possibility of any larger M&A? And how would you contrast that to the possibility of a dividend increase or a focus on buybacks?\nMark Mondello: Okay. So I'll split that into two. We're always out in the market shopping. We do a very nice job I think in terms of small M&A. I would say our focus is going to be on maybe further transactions that look a little bit like the JJMD transaction in terms of big brands getting out of manufacturing. That would be one area we continue to spend quite a bit of time on. Small M&A around capabilities, I wouldn't imagine anything too sizable in terms of direct M&A just because even with the recent correction in the U.S. equity markets, the prices are still quite high. And then if I think of the other derivative of capital allocation in terms of buyback and dividend, we're still -- we've got authorization out to complete our $1 billion buyback. And if there's any benefit whatsoever in the recent equity market corrections is the fact we're out in the market buying back our stock. So I think today with the outlook for the business over the next couple of years, where I think we're headed, what we could do in terms of margin, what we could do in terms of some continued growth, I think buybacks make a lot more sense than any type of change to our dividend. I do believe at some point in time that a well thought multiyear dividend plan will make sense, just not now.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that. And if I can just squeeze one more quick on in for Mike, looks like inventory was up 15% sequentially. But you are maintaining your free cash flow guide of 700 million plus on higher revenues and earnings. So can you just talk about your CapEx requirements for this year? I don't know if you mentioned that on the call yet. And how should we think about the cash conversion cycle and the cadence of free cash flow? Thanks for all the details. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Ruplu.\nMike Dastoor: If you go back a couple of years, we were in the 3% plus range for CapEx. Over time, we brought it down to about 2.6%. I feel pretty comfortable with that level. Obviously, revenues have gone up a little bit. At the start of the year, we said about 825. Maybe that's now 850-ish. So we're still maintaining that 2.6% CapEx level. And our free cash flow yield is something we focus on quite a bit. We're not where we wanted to be and we'll be taking it up slowly through the next few quarters and get in the 50% range at some point in time. And that's what the management team is focused on.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Mark, I had a couple of questions regarding your segments. If you look at your forward guide for FY '22, it looks like you're taking up the 5G wireless and cloud segment and industrial and semi-cap segment fairly significantly. Could you give us color there, specifically on the 5G and cloud? Is that from both segments or are you still seeing more strength on the cloud side versus 5G?\nMark Mondello: It's both. I mentioned earlier in the last response about the good fortune we've had with really, really smart people in our company at a sector level that really, really understand the end markets. And much like we did with personalized healthcare per se, much like we did with electric vehicles, our focus on kind of the networking, cloud, 5G wireless part of our business got us integrated heavily into the 5G rollout. So that's starting to pay good dividends in terms of growth. And then, I don't even remember the timeframe, but it was around the same timeframe when we did the JJMD deal because I remember talking about both of them together. Our team has come up -- or did come up and is executing to an asset-light cloud configuration type of service in region that has just been adopted and performing quite well. So I would say, when you see -- I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think what we said at the beginning of the year was the 5G wireless business would be around 5.5 billion, something like that. Last year, it was just over 5 billion. And I think we're now saying it will be bumping up against 6 billion. It's equally split. And then I think your other comment was around industrial and our semi-cap business. Again, that's very broad based. So again, if I look at our industrial, semi-cap business a couple of years ago, it was sub $3 billion and now that business will be bumping up against $4 billion. But I wouldn't want to break that out just because the contributions or everything from semi-cap to solar to light industrial, heavy industrial, it's sprinkled across that whole sector.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And just as a follow up just regarding the supply constraints that everyone is seeing. Jabil seems to be managing it as well, if not better, than any of your peers. Are you seeing any signs of ease in terms of supply opening up, particularly the legacy semiconductor parts that seem to be hard to get, any signs of relief there?\nMark Mondello: Let me start with your last part first. I think when it comes to what you'd characterize or think about as legacy semiconductors, it's still challenging when I step back though and I look at the whole business in terms of Jabil. So this isn't a proxy for maybe the market per se. I'm talking about strictly what we use, what we consume, our supply chain across mobility, connected devices, EVs, healthcare, packaging, digital print, retail, the whole deal. I believe that we started talking last fall that we thought with our team, the supply chain issues might start showing some improvement in the springtime of 2022. So that's kind of where we sit today. And I think we're starting to see some relief. I would say the overall supply chain challenges, again, whether it's raw metals availability, and I'm strictly talking about continuity of supply, have gotten moderately better. I would probably take legacy semiconductors and still put that in the bucket of constrained. Although with our relationships, we tend to be managing that quite well as well. I would also, maybe from a relativity standpoint or a contextual standpoint, suggest that the current guide that Mike gave and the $7.25, I think we've done a pretty good job of contemplating all the supply chain issues and events in terms of weaving that into our guide for the balance of the year.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nMark Mondello: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations on the good results and thanks for taking my questions. I was first hoping to talk about the inventory. The company talked about carrying some additional inventory and also taking some deposits from customers to help manage that. Would you say that the extra inventory you're holding, is some of that strategic buffer inventory that customers are compensating Jabil for to hold some extra stock or is this also partly an incomplete kitting issue?\nMike Dastoor: I think it's all of the above, Mark. Obviously, we have some kitting issues that drives the inventory up. There's a little bit of buffering. There's a little bit of strategic hold. And that's where we offset it with the inventory deposits. So depending on how we're balancing our inventory numbers, the deposits do offset a considerable amount. I think I talked about 86 days. It sounds like a very high number. But if you take the inventory deposits out, it's about 70 days. So I think, overall, am I worried about the inventory? Not so much. I think we're having a temporary tightness in the supply chain, which is causing some of this. I also talked a little bit about -- there was a little bit of a timing difference in our DMS business with the launch of new products. I fully expect that to reverse in Q3 as well, and that's what gives us confidence to maintain a 700 million plus free cash flow number as well. So overall, a little bit of a challenge right now in inventory. Am I concerned mid to long term? The answer is no.\nMark Delaney: That is helpful, Mike. Thank you. And then my follow up was on the China region and the operational situation there given the rising COVID cases. And you touched on it a bit already, but could you comment more about to what extent any of the Jabil facilities are having to take shutdowns? And if so, do you have an expectation for how long those could last? And then on the related topic, to what extent are other companies that are either suppliers or customers are you seeing any indirect effects from shutdowns in the region on your business? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yes. I think it would be neglectful to suggest that's not a risk. Again, we've got a great global footprint, moving stuff in and out of China. We've done that as efficiently as anybody. But in terms of in-region or in Mainland China, it's a risk. And I don't want to make light of the risk. But again, it's something that we've been handling in terms of quarantines, dormitory quarantines, campus quarantines, different province quarantines, city quarantines for two years. And at least as we sit today, this time doesn't feel any different. I think where probably the biggest risk is, is when I think about the stringent protocols that Jabil uses on our own campuses. I feel very good about how we're managing the situation. I think the bigger risk element would be the greater supply chain, getting materials in and out of campuses and/or logistics, et cetera. As we sit today, assuming that there continues to be pockets of COVID and it's not extensive in terms of timing of shutdowns, all of that's been considered in our numbers. If the COVID issues inside of Mainland China were to get maybe a magnitude more severe than -- again, that's certainly a risk for consideration. But as we sit today, we're two years in. I've got a lot of experience dealing with it, got a great team on the ground there. And again, if things stay kind of like-for-like as they sit today, we'll be fine through the end of the fiscal year.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and guide. I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on expectations for core margin per segment. I think we all saw the press release on stepping up hiring in the healthcare business. Just wondering how that's flowing through margins or if that's not yet expected to impact them?\nMark Mondello: Sure. Well, I think on one of the slides today that was posted or shown during the call, if you look at the green box, which we talk about as kind of our diversified manufacturing business, I think what we're suggesting there is, is collectively that group of businesses will run on the core margin line around 5%. And then the blue box on what we characterize our EMS business is running about 4%. Both of those margin, call them goals, targets, or guide, both of those I think on an annual basis -- and again, if I go back 15 years, those are probably the strongest margins we've posted in terms of as we bifurcated the business, EMS, DMS. We don't break out margins in terms of I think both the green box, the DMS box; and the EMS box, the blue box. Each of them have four sectors defined, and we share kind of the revenue trends there. But we don't break out margins. And again, maybe at some point, we'll start breaking those up. But today, we don't.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay, great. Thanks. And then finally, on inventories, you noted ex-deposits, your inventory days are running around 70 days. Can you give us a comparison what that number was last quarter, or maybe historically what that number has trended toward?\nMark Mondello: Yes. I would say, all-in-all, whether you look at the gross line or the net line, we're probably 12 to 14 days of additional fluff with overall inventory. And as Mike just commented on, we're not overly concerned about that. The balance sheet is in great shape. And we think in the relative near term that corrects. And again, I think our goal internally is, at a minimum, to take that down by 12, 14 days.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay, great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Paul Chung from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the market share gains you mentioned, is this more from Asian-based players or some of your domestic peers or both, and then scale players versus more fragmented smaller players? And what are some key factors that are kind of closing those deals for you?\nMark Mondello: Again, it will sound redundant, but it's kind of -- it's across the board. And again, I just think that the market is so sizable and we've just gotten pretty good at kind of pulling together the IT solutions, the product design solutions. The way we're performing and executing on the factory floors, I think it's been a testament to our supply chain folks the last two years in terms of how they've navigated the market. And I think, all-in-all, I'd characterize that as people see Jabil as a safe pair of hands. And I also think there's not much good that's come out of COVID. But one of the things COVID has done is really have companies sit back and give much deeper thought to their overall supply chain strategically forward-looking. And I think, all-in-all, that's what's generated a lot of the conversations in terms of market share gains. I wouldn't want to sit and handicap whether it's Asian-based or domestic-based or European-based. I think it's across the board.\nPaul Chung: Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then just on the strong free cash flow guide, most of the strength there is from earnings, which is great. So how big of a drag in your view is working cap for the fiscal year? Just want to get a sense for more normalized free cash flow, which hopefully reverts later this calendar year and into kind of next fiscal year. Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: So Paul, when we started the year, I think we guided to 31.5 billion of revenues. We took that up to 31.8 million. And now we've taken it up to 32.6 billion. So there's been a decent amount of growth in our revenue numbers. That obviously drives a higher level of working capital. But we've managed -- we've worked out how to manage working capital really well as a team. We feel confident with our 700 million free cash flow. In fact, I think we might be able to deliver a little bit more than 700 million. I think the inventory probably normalizes not fully by the end of the year, but a little bit. I think I mentioned it's three or four days of inventory due to timing differences. I expect that to reverse completely in Q3. And overall, our collections, our AP payments, et cetera, give me full confidence in the 700 million plus of free cash flow.\nPaul Chung: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. This now concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. To begin with, our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the war in Ukraine. When I think about our team, along with their families, what comes to mind are words like admiration, courage and heart. Please know we're in constant communication with those on the ground.  And we continue to provide resources and financial assistance as the safety and security of those in Ukraine is our top priority. At Jabil, we're one corporate family with people located all over the world. And despite the physical distance between us, we'll always face difficult situations together. To all of our employees, thank you for being servant leaders, thank you for your spirit and thank you for looking after one another.  Let's now turn to Slide 6, where we'll take a look at our second quarter results. Q2 was another strong quarter, both top line and bottom line, driven by double digit revenue growth year-on-year and exceptional execution, respectively. Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.68 on revenue of $7.6 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase year-on-year.  All-in-all, I'm pleased with the quarter as our performance during the first half of the year gives us positive momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '22 and into fiscal '23. And when I think about a key catalyst driving our momentum, what comes to mind is the makeup of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide.  Slide 7 is a wonderful picture which shows the construct of our portfolio today. Jabil's large scale diversification serves as a solid foundation from which we run our business. The team has built this foundation over the past five to six years as we target new end markets and optimize our legacy business.  The output of this effort is twofold; one, a higher level of resiliency across the company and two, a substantial presence in secular end markets. Markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing, and clean energy.  If we dissect the pie chart a bit differently, with an emphasis on financial contribution and economic relevance, we see a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows. Again, a real tribute to the diversified nature of our business today. Lastly, if we look at a third dimension of our portfolio, we find a library of essential capabilities; capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands. And when done correctly, our unique set of capabilities offer Jabil a real competitive advantage, as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.  Moving on to Slide 8, you'll see management's outlook for the year. We've increased core earnings per share to $7.25, an increase of nearly 30% year-on-year. As for revenue, FY '22 now looks to be in the range of $32.6 billion, up more than 10% year-on-year.  In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year, while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year. For me, this is a positive testament on how the team is managing the business, as our strategy has been consistent and what needs to be done is well understood throughout our company.  With that, let's move to my final slide where I'd like to start with the importance of our purpose. At Jabil, with purpose comes expectations; expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, protecting the environment, giving back to our communities and offering a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance.  Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been more important than they are today. I'm proud of our team as they fully grasp our purpose. And in doing so, their conduct is exceptional. In closing, our improvement is steady, commercially, financially and operationally. Quite simply, here at Jabil we build stuff and we do it really well.  One factor that makes good companies great is having a value set, a culture, if you will, that enhances the way in which they solve problems. As a team, we embrace this as we take on the challenges put forth by our customers each and every day. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making the Jabil Jabil.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Hi, Jim. I think the overall margin profile, if you just go back to, let's say, pre-COVID to fiscal '19, we were running the business at around 3.5% margins. And our focus at that point in time was really about reshaping the overall portfolio and a big focus on diversification in both top line and bottom line. I think the team did a really nice job of that over a four, five-year period. And then starting in fiscal '21, so last year, we really started taking that portfolio at scale and focusing hard on the margin side of the business, largely around costs and optimization, while still being what I think is very competitive in the marketplace in terms of our pricing. This year, we've taken margins up. I think September, we said margins would go up to 4.5% from the 4.2% last year. And then this morning, we're taking it up another 10 basis points to 4.6% for the year. I think the main catalyst driving it is our execution has been outstanding and I think sustainable. I think the overall platform around the operational network, the tools, our IT systems also sustainable, and the advances we've made there are terrific. And then lastly, and maybe most importantly is, is just the overall portfolio that we have, Jim, when we think about how diverse we are, when we think about the contributions of the business, we look at the blend between automotive and transportation, healthcare, connected device, mobility, digital print, retail, industrial, cloud, 5G, networking, semi-cap, et cetera. It's just a wonderful, wonderful book of business today. We think that will continue to scale. And as I said, at some point in the last 18 months or so, I really believe as this business continues to get beyond $35 billion, $37 billion, $40 billion, we're going to effort internally to run the business at five points of margin on the operating line. Thanks, Jim. Okay, there's a lot. Let me try to break that out. So if I think about growth at scale, which I think was the first part of your question, I think -- I'd break that up to say, one, the team as we went through, diversified the company and really were able to step back once we got to what I'd maybe call significant scale. The team, call it a little bit of luck, call it some good planning, call it a lot of thoughtfulness, we have really, really been fortunate to get into some, like really substantial, very real secular markets. And I think in my prepared remarks, I talked about things like electric vehicles, personalized health, cloud computing, clean energy, et cetera. So strategically, the way we run strategy in the company is not so much top down, but through each of our sectors. And that's where our experts are. So the last two, three, four years, we've done a really nice job of placing our bets from a revenue perspective into some pretty powerful secular trends. That's number one. Number two is, we continue to pick up market share. So sometimes it's always difficult when people are trying to triangulate our numbers to current macro situations because what ends up getting left behind is, is the market share gains. And I think in my prepared remarks today, I think I used a term like massive. The market's massive and there's always going to be a need for things to be built and supply chains to be reconstructed. And we're pretty good at both of those things. And then lastly, is just the continued growth that we've seen, what I'd say more of our core legacy business has been strong over the last 18, 24 months. So I would say those are the catalysts. I don't foresee the company -- as we get to $35 billion, $37 billion, $40 billion, I wouldn't imagine the company is going to continue to grow strong double digits. But at least, as we look at the horizon, I think the company is going to grow nonetheless over the next three to five years for sure. In terms of footprint, our footprint's exceptional. And whether we look at cutting Southeast Asia, China, Europe, Brazil, Mexico, U.S., again, when I -- this common theme -- and I know it sounds redundant, but this common theme around diversification, we think about diversification in so many different ways and a subset of that is certainly our overall global footprint. Today, our big focus, economics aside, of course, is our footprint in Eastern Europe. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our hearts go out to everyone there at the moment on the ground, because what they're going through is horrific. And that's where a lot of our thoughts and time are spent over the last couple of weeks. But of all the things I worry about, or said differently, the things I feel good about on our footprint, I feel very, very good about where our footprint is today, Steve. Have a good day. Yes, I'm hesitating because I'm thinking. I'm always concerned about a lot of things all the time. There's a war going on. And obviously, that's a concern. And for me that concern is, this will be the third time I'll say it, right, is really about the well being and the safety and security of our people. And I don't know how to say this. But in terms of a pure financial economic perspective, that doesn't give me a lot of concern. Saying that though, I do want to emphasize it's a bit heartbreaking to me and very emotional with that situation over there. And it has our full attention. So I would say supply chains, we tend to navigate that as good as anybody at the moment. Does that give me concern through the rest of the fiscal year? Maybe. A collapse in the macro in the very near term? Not so much. Inflation? I think we're managing that quite well. And I would say, I don't know, there's been a dust up here recently with some more COVID issues in Mainland China. And Ruplu, I would say we've been dealing with that literally like firsthand since the issues in Wuhan in January of 2020. And when I think about our campuses and places like Wuxi and Weihai and Huangpu and Shenzhen and Shanghai and Tianjin and Chengdu, we got a great team over there. We've been navigating that quite well. So as we think about the balance of the year and maybe first part of '23, as we sit today as a management team, we got pretty good confidence in the guide for the balance of the year and the beginning outlook for '23. Okay. So I'll split that into two. We're always out in the market shopping. We do a very nice job I think in terms of small M&A. I would say our focus is going to be on maybe further transactions that look a little bit like the JJMD transaction in terms of big brands getting out of manufacturing. That would be one area we continue to spend quite a bit of time on. Small M&A around capabilities, I wouldn't imagine anything too sizable in terms of direct M&A just because even with the recent correction in the U.S. equity markets, the prices are still quite high. And then if I think of the other derivative of capital allocation in terms of buyback and dividend, we're still -- we've got authorization out to complete our $1 billion buyback. And if there's any benefit whatsoever in the recent equity market corrections is the fact we're out in the market buying back our stock. So I think today with the outlook for the business over the next couple of years, where I think we're headed, what we could do in terms of margin, what we could do in terms of some continued growth, I think buybacks make a lot more sense than any type of change to our dividend. I do believe at some point in time that a well thought multiyear dividend plan will make sense, just not now. Thanks, Ruplu. It's both. I mentioned earlier in the last response about the good fortune we've had with really, really smart people in our company at a sector level that really, really understand the end markets. And much like we did with personalized healthcare per se, much like we did with electric vehicles, our focus on kind of the networking, cloud, 5G wireless part of our business got us integrated heavily into the 5G rollout. So that's starting to pay good dividends in terms of growth. And then, I don't even remember the timeframe, but it was around the same timeframe when we did the JJMD deal because I remember talking about both of them together. Our team has come up -- or did come up and is executing to an asset-light cloud configuration type of service in region that has just been adopted and performing quite well. So I would say, when you see -- I don't remember the exact numbers, but I think what we said at the beginning of the year was the 5G wireless business would be around 5.5 billion, something like that. Last year, it was just over 5 billion. And I think we're now saying it will be bumping up against 6 billion. It's equally split. And then I think your other comment was around industrial and our semi-cap business. Again, that's very broad based. So again, if I look at our industrial, semi-cap business a couple of years ago, it was sub $3 billion and now that business will be bumping up against $4 billion. But I wouldn't want to break that out just because the contributions or everything from semi-cap to solar to light industrial, heavy industrial, it's sprinkled across that whole sector. Let me start with your last part first. I think when it comes to what you'd characterize or think about as legacy semiconductors, it's still challenging when I step back though and I look at the whole business in terms of Jabil. So this isn't a proxy for maybe the market per se. I'm talking about strictly what we use, what we consume, our supply chain across mobility, connected devices, EVs, healthcare, packaging, digital print, retail, the whole deal. I believe that we started talking last fall that we thought with our team, the supply chain issues might start showing some improvement in the springtime of 2022. So that's kind of where we sit today. And I think we're starting to see some relief. I would say the overall supply chain challenges, again, whether it's raw metals availability, and I'm strictly talking about continuity of supply, have gotten moderately better. I would probably take legacy semiconductors and still put that in the bucket of constrained. Although with our relationships, we tend to be managing that quite well as well. I would also, maybe from a relativity standpoint or a contextual standpoint, suggest that the current guide that Mike gave and the $7.25, I think we've done a pretty good job of contemplating all the supply chain issues and events in terms of weaving that into our guide for the balance of the year. Thanks. Yes. I think it would be neglectful to suggest that's not a risk. Again, we've got a great global footprint, moving stuff in and out of China. We've done that as efficiently as anybody. But in terms of in-region or in Mainland China, it's a risk. And I don't want to make light of the risk. But again, it's something that we've been handling in terms of quarantines, dormitory quarantines, campus quarantines, different province quarantines, city quarantines for two years. And at least as we sit today, this time doesn't feel any different. I think where probably the biggest risk is, is when I think about the stringent protocols that Jabil uses on our own campuses. I feel very good about how we're managing the situation. I think the bigger risk element would be the greater supply chain, getting materials in and out of campuses and/or logistics, et cetera. As we sit today, assuming that there continues to be pockets of COVID and it's not extensive in terms of timing of shutdowns, all of that's been considered in our numbers. If the COVID issues inside of Mainland China were to get maybe a magnitude more severe than -- again, that's certainly a risk for consideration. But as we sit today, we're two years in. I've got a lot of experience dealing with it, got a great team on the ground there. And again, if things stay kind of like-for-like as they sit today, we'll be fine through the end of the fiscal year. Thanks, Mark. Sure. Well, I think on one of the slides today that was posted or shown during the call, if you look at the green box, which we talk about as kind of our diversified manufacturing business, I think what we're suggesting there is, is collectively that group of businesses will run on the core margin line around 5%. And then the blue box on what we characterize our EMS business is running about 4%. Both of those margin, call them goals, targets, or guide, both of those I think on an annual basis -- and again, if I go back 15 years, those are probably the strongest margins we've posted in terms of as we bifurcated the business, EMS, DMS. We don't break out margins in terms of I think both the green box, the DMS box; and the EMS box, the blue box. Each of them have four sectors defined, and we share kind of the revenue trends there. But we don't break out margins. And again, maybe at some point, we'll start breaking those up. But today, we don't. Yes. I would say, all-in-all, whether you look at the gross line or the net line, we're probably 12 to 14 days of additional fluff with overall inventory. And as Mike just commented on, we're not overly concerned about that. The balance sheet is in great shape. And we think in the relative near term that corrects. And again, I think our goal internally is, at a minimum, to take that down by 12, 14 days. Again, it will sound redundant, but it's kind of -- it's across the board. And again, I just think that the market is so sizable and we've just gotten pretty good at kind of pulling together the IT solutions, the product design solutions. The way we're performing and executing on the factory floors, I think it's been a testament to our supply chain folks the last two years in terms of how they've navigated the market. And I think, all-in-all, I'd characterize that as people see Jabil as a safe pair of hands. And I also think there's not much good that's come out of COVID. But one of the things COVID has done is really have companies sit back and give much deeper thought to their overall supply chain strategically forward-looking. And I think, all-in-all, that's what's generated a lot of the conversations in terms of market share gains. I wouldn't want to sit and handicap whether it's Asian-based or domestic-based or European-based. I think it's across the board."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us today. I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our diversified portfolio and the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, as several of our end markets continue to benefit from long-term secular trends. As Mark just summarized, our Q2 results were very strong. During the quarter, revenue, core operating income, core EPS and free cash flow, all exceeded our December expectations.  Given the higher revenue, I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive an extra 30 basis points of margin improvement compared to our expectations in December, mainly through broad-based trends in several key end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends, as well as outstanding execution by our business, operations and supply chain teams. For the quarter, revenue was approximately $7.6 billion, up 10.6% over the prior year quarter and ahead of the midpoint of our guidance from December. The additional upside was mainly driven by our 5G and cloud businesses, while our automotive, healthcare and retail end markets remained very strong.  Our GAAP operating income during the quarter was $313 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51. Core operating income during the quarter was $344 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.6%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.68, a 32% improvement over the prior year quarter.  Now, turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. The solid year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and connected devices businesses. Core margin for the segment came in at 5.1%.  Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.8 billion, an increase of 19% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad based with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi-cap and 5G wireless and cloud businesses. Core margin for the segment was 4%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting improvements and solid execution by the team. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q2, inventory days came in at 86 days. The sequential increase in days was driven largely by two factors. Firstly, the ongoing tightness in the supply chain continues to weigh on our inventory balances. It's worth noting that we've offset a portion of these increases with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of these inventory deposits, inventory days was 71 in Q2.  And second, at the end of the quarter, we experienced a timing difference on the sell-through of finished goods within our DMS segment. I anticipate this timing difference to reverse in Q3. In spite of these two factors impacting inventory, our second quarter cash flows from operations were very robust coming in at $246 million and net capital expenditures totaled $201 million.  From a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter at approximately 1.3x and with cash balances of $1.1 billion. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $145 million. And for the year, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $272 million as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.  Turning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 17% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.2 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4 billion. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $300 million to $360 million, representing a core margin range of 3.8% to 4.2%. At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 20 basis points over the prior year and down sequentially reflecting planned investments in our Q3 quarter.  It's also worth noting, sequentially in Q4, we expect robust core margins driven by our scaling automotive business, along with typical seasonality in our mobility and EMS businesses. In Q3, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $276 million to $336 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.64. The core tax rate in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 21%. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, the outlook for our business is strong, with end markets across both segments continuing to benefit from multiyear secular trends. We believe these markets will continue to drive our growth as we concentrate our efforts on long-term secular growth markets with strong margins and cash flow dynamics.  Markets such as electric vehicles, personalized medicine and healthcare, semi-cap, clean and smart energy infrastructure, cloud, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices. Our electric vehicle business in particular continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates.  We've seen this rapid acceleration manifested in top line revenue growth in excess of 50% this year alone in our automotive end market. We're also expecting double digit growth for the healthcare, automotive, retail, industrial and semi-cap and 5G wireless and cloud end markets. And importantly, the broad-based growth associated with the secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin and free cash flow expansion.  All-in-all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year. We're now anticipating core EPS will be in the neighborhood of $7.25 per share on revenue of approximately $32.6 billion. Notably, this incremental revenue will improve mix and drive operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.6% for FY '22, as we continue to drive the organization to 5% and beyond.  Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating in excess of $700 million in free cash flow in spite of the higher revenue and associated working capital. We've been working extremely hard as a team to expand margins and drive strong cash flows. I'm very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam. If you go back a couple of years, we were in the 3% plus range for CapEx. Over time, we brought it down to about 2.6%. I feel pretty comfortable with that level. Obviously, revenues have gone up a little bit. At the start of the year, we said about 825. Maybe that's now 850-ish. So we're still maintaining that 2.6% CapEx level. And our free cash flow yield is something we focus on quite a bit. We're not where we wanted to be and we'll be taking it up slowly through the next few quarters and get in the 50% range at some point in time. And that's what the management team is focused on. I think it's all of the above, Mark. Obviously, we have some kitting issues that drives the inventory up. There's a little bit of buffering. There's a little bit of strategic hold. And that's where we offset it with the inventory deposits. So depending on how we're balancing our inventory numbers, the deposits do offset a considerable amount. I think I talked about 86 days. It sounds like a very high number. But if you take the inventory deposits out, it's about 70 days. So I think, overall, am I worried about the inventory? Not so much. I think we're having a temporary tightness in the supply chain, which is causing some of this. I also talked a little bit about -- there was a little bit of a timing difference in our DMS business with the launch of new products. I fully expect that to reverse in Q3 as well, and that's what gives us confidence to maintain a 700 million plus free cash flow number as well. So overall, a little bit of a challenge right now in inventory. Am I concerned mid to long term? The answer is no. So Paul, when we started the year, I think we guided to 31.5 billion of revenues. We took that up to 31.8 million. And now we've taken it up to 32.6 billion. So there's been a decent amount of growth in our revenue numbers. That obviously drives a higher level of working capital. But we've managed -- we've worked out how to manage working capital really well as a team. We feel confident with our 700 million free cash flow. In fact, I think we might be able to deliver a little bit more than 700 million. I think the inventory probably normalizes not fully by the end of the year, but a little bit. I think I mentioned it's three or four days of inventory due to timing differences. I expect that to reverse completely in Q3. And overall, our collections, our AP payments, et cetera, give me full confidence in the 700 million plus of free cash flow."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin\nAdam Berry: Good morning and welcome to Jabil\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2022 earnings call. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today\u2019s call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks we will be referencing slides. To follow on with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our investor relations section. At the conclusion of today\u2019s call, the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website. I now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the website beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call we will be making forward-looking statements including among other things those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected second quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecast and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I\u2019d now like to shift our focus to our strong quarter and outstanding results. First off, the team delivered $400 million of core operating income and roughly $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%. These results were primarily driven by broad base strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap and of course, mobility has customary for our first fiscal quarter. And finally, it's worth noting that our team was able to accomplish all of this in spite of the chaotic global supply chain environment. In summary, we delivered strong results, grew in key end markets, and successfully navigated a dynamic global supply chain, clearly demonstrating the power of Jabil by way of our scale, tools, team and relationship. In a few moments, both Mike and Mark will provide more details on the quarter, while also addressing our improved outlook for the year. But before I hand it over, I'll pass along some thoughts from Jabil\u2019s procurement and supply chain team, as you may find it helpful when modeling our year. In short, demand continues to outstrip supply, particularly as it relates to semiconductors and issue that has persisted since 2019. That said, Jabil continues to leverage best-in-class tools and relationships to maximize our allocation and keep the factories in production to the best of our ability. So far, we have been extremely successful, and we would like to thank our supplier partners for their continued support and commitment to Jabil. As we move ahead, we anticipate continued supply chain challenges, which have been incorporated in our guidance similar to previous quarters. We do expect some relief towards the back half of the fiscal year, but the general consensus is that demand will remain ahead of supply for the next six months. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you, Adam. And thank you for joining us today. As Adam just highlighted Q1 was an exceptional quarter. The team delivered strong results on three fronts; revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share. Our results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end market strength and excellent operation execution by the entire Jabil team along with lower tax and interest expense. Net revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior quarter. GAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior quarter. Now turning to our first quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.7 billion and increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad based, the strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses. Core margin for the segment came in at 5.4%. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. For stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad based with strength across our digital print retail, industrial and semi cap and 5G wireless and cloud businesses. Core margin for the segment was 3.8%, 40 basis points higher than the prior reflecting solid execution by the team. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q1, inventory days came in at 66 days decline a five day sequentially. The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment and I expect over the medium to longer term our inventory days to normalize below 60. Cash flows used in operations were $46 million in Q1, and net capital expenditures totalled $73 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels to approximately 1.3 times and cash balances of $1.2 billion. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares or $127 million. Turning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 4% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion, while EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to $3.6 billion. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $266 million to $326 million. Core related earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.55. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39. The tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 24%. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, both segments are in incredibly good shape. In September, I highlighted several long term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets, such as healthcare, automotive, cloud, semi cap, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices along with power generation and energy storage. For the remainder of FY 2022 and beyond, we continue to expect these secular trends to drive strong growth. Our electric vehicle business in particular continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues, as the transition to ED [ph] accelerates. And importantly, a broad based growth associated with the secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin expansion in both segments, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong financial results for FY 2022. And a balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long term value creation to shareholders. I would like to wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday. Thank you for your time today. And thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks Mike. Good morning. I'll begin today by thanking our folks here at Jabil for making safety, their personal priority. I'd also like to recognize their hard work and tireless commitment, which drove solid results for our first fiscal quarter. Again, thank you. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I'd like to wish all of you a safe and peaceful holiday season. With that, let's move to our next slide. Where I'd like to expand on what Mike and Adam addressed in their prepared remarks. Not only did our team deliver a favorable first quarter, but the diversification of our business was fundamental to the results. With each sector having a material contribution in the solutions we offer our customers and with each sector having a material contribution to our financial results. Specifically, the four sectors in our DMS segment focus on margins while offering reliable cash flows. While the four sectors in our EMS segment focus on cash flows, while offering reliable margins, a perfect complement as the well diversified construct of Jabil continues to drive our execution. If we dig a little deeper, we find secular trends embedded within certain sectors. Secular markets, where we now play and have a substantial presence. We believe these markets will drive our growth, with the overwhelming majority of such growth occurring organically, as we placed our attention on secular opportunities, opportunities such as 5G, electric vehicles, personalized health care, cloud computing, and clean energy. Furthermore, our commercial portfolio is intentional, and we think quite special. Each slice of this pie harbors domain expertise, affording us an essential collection of valuable capabilities. Although what's most impactful is the way in which we merge these capabilities with precision and speed as we serve our customers. Our approach is further enhanced by seamless collaboration across the organization combined with our unique Jabil structure. And when done correctly, we simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands. And we do so as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built, and supply chains need to be optimized.  One of the key outcomes of our approach is the fact that with each passing year, our results become less dependent on any single product or product family, which improves our resiliency, especially during times of macro disruption, and cyclical demand. I'll now take you through an update to our fiscal 2022 financial plan where you'll see the continued earnings power of the company. We've increased core earnings per share to $6.55 for the year, up $0.20 from our September outlook. We've also increased revenue to $31.8 billion, up from our initial guide of $31.5 billion. In addition, we're committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year as we navigate this challenging environment. In concert with these strong numbers, please note that our path forward is well understood throughout the company. And what needs to be done remains crystal clear. Quite simply, what we're doing is working a positive testament on how our team is managing the business. Moving on from the financials, I'd like to talk about purpose. At Jabil, purpose serves as our guidepost. When we think about purpose, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and getting back to the many communities where we live. Please note that these behaviors as displayed by our team are exceptional. In closing, our improvement is steady and our strategy is consistent. And as a team, we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to those we serve. All-in-all, I feel good about where we've been. But I feel even better about where we're going. In simple terms, at Jabil we build stuff and we do so really, really well. We also solve problems over and over again, that\u2019s why we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety as you care for one another. To everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks Mark. Before we begin our Q&A session, I'd like to remind everyone on our call that we cannot address customer or product specific questions. Otherwise, we're now ready for your Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Good Morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You talked about component shortages. Is there a way for us to -- for you to quantify for us what was the revenue impact in the November quarter from component shortages? And what have you factored in for the February quarter? And how you see these component shortages lasting into 2022?\nMark Mondello: Hey Ruplu thanks for the question. I don't -- I don't know that we really look at it that way. How I would answer it maybe would be maybe getting away from Q1. And I'm not doing that for any reason other than I kind of think about the year a bit deeper. I'd say that we've taken the year now from 31, five to 31, eight. I think that's up from like 29 three last year. And I think we've done a really good job, spending a lot of time with our commercial folks, our operations folks, and our supply chain procurement folks. So I believe that we've handicapped supply chain properly, to deliver the 31 eight. I guess in an unconstrained environment. I don't know maybe the maybe the 31 eight would be somewhere 32 something in terms of top line. But again, I think we spend more time really kind of looking at our factories, looking at the looking at the pipeline of materials, and then a lot of communication and connectivity between our supply chain procurement folks, our operations folks and our commercial folks. So I think maybe the main takeaway is Simmons supply chain continues to be kind of bumpy and a bit unpredictable for the next couple of quarters. We believe we've handicap that properly to deliver the year, or said differently the 31.8 billion. In terms of when we see things getting better for -- I like the question because it allows me to give a shout out to our supply chain procurement team for what they did in, in in for 4Q of last year in Q1 of this year, in delivering the numbers, we overshot revenue by a 300 million for the quarter and a lot of that had to do with the whole team, but just tremendous work from the supply chain procurement group. I think that will continue to be in this environment and in one way, shape perform probably through the spring into early summer. But I think we start seeing things getting better six to nine months from now.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks for the details on that Mark. That's, that's helpful. Mike, wanted to ask you on free cash flow looks like inventory was up 6% sequentially, after two quarters of I think it was double digit growth. And that's understandable given the component environment. But can you help us you've maintained the 700 million plus a guide for the full year. Can you help us think about the pace of free cash flow over the next two, three quarters? How should we think about which quarters are stronger which quarters are weaker?\nMike Dastoor: Ruplu, I've sort of moved in the same direction as in previous years and previous quarters. In past years, the trend will be pretty similar, the seasonality attached to our free cash flow. So that doesn't change much through these times. We do expect the supply chain constraints to open up a little bit. And in Q4, I think the cash flow will be a lot higher. So I think overall, similar trends to last year with a slightly stronger performance in Q4 is the best way to model that group.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, and maybe for my last question, Mike, if I can just ask you. How should we think about your capital allocation priorities? Specifically, if you can talk about how you're thinking about buybacks versus, maybe M&A. And also the tax rate was a little bit lower this quarter than expected. How should we think about that for the full year? Thanks so much.\nMike Dastoor: Sure Ruplu. So we have on buybacks, we have a billion dollar authorization. I think we still have about, I think it's about 830 million of that authorization left. We\u2019ll continue to be well balanced in our capital allocation. I personally feel the stock is still highly undervalued. So buyback will be an integral part of our capital allocation framework. M&A, as we've done in the past Ruplu, we've done tuck-in, M&A\u2019s capability driven M&As. And I think in September we highlighted a little bit of a capital allocation framework there as well. At this stage, no changes to that M&A, tuck-ins will continue as we as we progress through the year.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: And on the tax rate, any guidance for the full year?\nMike Dastoor: Tax, so for Q2, I think we've said 24% in that range Ruplu the reason it was it was good as purely because of the mix, issue. income coming through in different jurisdictions where in 30 countries, so there's a lot of moving parts, but in that 24% range, should be to be a good guide for now.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great. Thanks for all the details and congrats on the strong execution.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. Question for Mark. When all of this hit with COVID, and before that even trade wars, we're talking 2,3,4 years ago, there was discussions about your customers, maybe changing the sourcing of where they're going to actually have you do the work for it and not be as concentrated to mitigate risk. Just curious as we roll it forward now, several years has a lot of that materialized? Are they still in discussions? Is it off the tables? Or has it already come to pass? Or some of it has and some of the still being talked about. I was kind of curious about, how that all ended up because we've been in a world of trade wars, uncertainties, COVID, and supply constraints now for a couple of years and just kind of wonder what the materiality of, of actions from your customers. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim. Trying to figure out timeframe. Let's keep with the three to four years you talked about. I'd say that -- I'd say for the last, I don't know, dozen years, we have a bunch of tools that have kind of migrated from manual tools to more digital tools to more data analytics as the company's matured and advanced forward, but tools nonetheless, where we've always gone from kind of manual spread sheets to the new digital tools in terms of optimizing supply chains for customers. Kind of the thesis of your question, though, around trade wars and tariffs and geopolitical issues and risk and COVID this and other issues. I would say that in the last 24 to 30 months, there has been a heightened sensitivity in terms of working with customers on a proactive basis to be sure that their overall supply chain manufacturing solutions are optimized derisks and as well as supportive with backup plans. So as an example, one of the things we talk about a lot is I think there's a huge advantage of building stuff when you have scale. And then you have diversification either top line or, or factories around the world. Today we're sitting in a in a really good place, because a lot of our customers put a lot of trust in Jabil. And we do the vast majority of their work. And even though they're inside a Jabil, we can provide fabulous redundancy plans if, if things go a bit sideways. So I'd say Jim, some of the things that you alluded to have been very real catalysts to, to maybe increase the priority in terms of supply chain and where we build stuff. And then the other neat thing about our tools today is with the advancement of the data analytics, and how we're positioned in the supply chain, both front end and back end, we also spend a significant amount of time with customers today, mapping their entire supply chain. So from the from the most basic precious metals through components, consideration to design, where the product is going to be manufactured, and then how it's going to be distributed. So I'd say all-in-all today, it's perpetual, I don't think it's ever done. But I think to your point, we've done an awful lot of work. And there's been a lot of prime catalysts for that type of work to be done. And I think overall, we do a pretty good job in that area for our customers.\nJim Suva: Thank you for the details and happy holidays to your team and congratulations.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Jim, you as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I have two, maybe starting on margin, if I could. So if you could comment a little bit on how you're thinking about the sustainability of margins. Obviously, you got to fiscal 2022. But over the longer term, and on the one hand, the company has been having to deal with supply chain costs COVID. And some of those challenge but also I\u2019m getting questions from investors about whether or not factory utilization is perhaps some unusually high when we think about how strong global demand for goods has been in some of the government stimulus programs that have been in place. And so any thoughts you can share on the puts and takes and sustainability of margins over the longer term please?\nMark Mondello: Thanks Mark. I think that let me start with factor utilization. I think factor utilization in 4Q and Q1 was mixed and choppy. We had and the biggest issue there is again, the supply chain dynamics. So I wouldn't conclude, I wouldn't conclude that any portion or a material portion of our results was due to hype or factory utilization. In fact, I think it was maybe a little bit of the opposite. So let's just call that let's just call that maybe a very slight net negative through Q1. And yet the results I think we\u2019re very, very good. If I then move, if I then move through, maybe the back half, somehow we've posted Q1, we've given you a fairly explicit numbers for Q2. If I think about the back half of the year, as I think about margins, I think the back half of fiscal 2021 margins for the whole company were around 4%. If I think about the back half of 2022, the overall margins for the company are going to be 30, 40 basis points greater than that. And I think that's a good indication of the composition of the business mix today, and where we're focused. And one of the things that we did in the slide deck today and the prepared remarks between Adam, Mike and myself is we're reinforcing the 4.5% for the year, by the way, when again, a decent portion of the year is going to be fraught with supply chain challenges. So that's up 30 basis points from last year, which last year was I think, a pretty good year for us. And I think where you're going is beyond this year, I don't want to get into too much speculation about where the business might be going in 2023 and 2024. Although, I made a comment sometime, I don't remember when sometime in the last 12 months or something like that during the JPMorgan conference, the question came up, and we were going back and forth, talking about kind of the midterm outlook for the company. And I suggested that, we were a company where we focus the vast, vast majority of our growth organically. We're not big on big M&A deals. And if that continues, and we continue to be successful in the marketplace, I do think we're on a trajectory where margins can be above the four and a half, I think maybe next step would be 46, 47. And, our internal efforts are going to be around running the company at 5% on the income line.\nMark Delaney: That's really helpful. I appreciate all the thoughts on that Mark. My follow up was about an award, the company just received the optical business unit. So I was awarded some recognition for one of its sensors. And so when you could speak a little bit more on what that business unit is doing, because I know it's, behind a lot of the different products areas, and perhaps where you're seeing the best growth are some of your optical and essential technology.\nMark Mondello: Well, I think we've -- if I choose to go all the way back to I go all the way back to, to an acquisition we made that has been proven quite good for us, both in knowledge in terms of R&D, which is active alignment on sensors, as well as optics. And we think that's, we think that's a really nice tool to have in our toolset because it cuts across so many different end markets. It's everything from consumer on kind of the consumer robotics side. It's in retail in terms of our robots in terms of the retail space. And it's certainly helping us in terms of autonomous driving in and the EV market. And they are also using it in some areas of industrial. So I think that when I think about I think in my prepared remarks, I'd talked about kind of how we weave together kind of a library full of capabilities, the act of alignment sensors, and optic sight is, is important part of that. And again, we like it because it's not pigeon holed into one particular business or one particular sector. It cuts across probably 50% of our eight sectors. So it's something that can be leveraged quite well.\nMark Delaney: Thank you. Congratulations on the good results and happy holidays.\nMark Mondello: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. And good morning. My first question Mark is just regarding your guidance for DMS in the quarter up 4% year-over-year yet you're guiding more than 10% for the fiscal year. Is that just a reflection of a pronounced seasonality in the mobility business? Or do some of the supply chain constraints and expectations of that improving through the year also play into that?\nMark Mondello: Hey, Matt, can you help me a little bit? So the 4% being what if I heard you correctly? You talking about -- You're not talking about op margin? You're talking about growth? Venture my growth rate for on the Q2?\nMatt Sheerin: That's right.\nMark Mondello: Okay. When you started, I was getting a little bit confused on whether you were talking about the\u2026\nMatt Sheerin: I was talking about the growth about a year-over-year growth.\nMark Mondello: Yes. I think that's, I think that's based on two things. I think it's largely based on I think that there's distortion in the comps year-on-year because last year with various product roadmaps and whatnot in DMS. They were a little bit different. And so I think the year-on-year comps are a little bit distortive. I would say if I back up and open the aperture a little bit who I really like. I really like the DMS construct and aside from the Q2 year-on-year comp, we still think and I think it was shown this way on the blue green slide that our DMS business is still going to grow 10% And that's at significant scale. So I appreciate the question because it is a it is a it is a one off I think every single quarter this year we'll be bumping up against double digits except for Q2. And again, largely due to the fact that I think Q2 of 21 was a little bit of an odd comp.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, that makes sense. And then I wanted to just ask about the auto business. You're one of the few companies actually taking auto numbers up, despite the on-going supply constraints. And I know there's a lot of momentum in EV. So could you discuss Jabil\u2019s position there, your areas of expertise and how you may be differentiated from competitors?\nMark Mondello: Yes, well, first off, I'd give, I'd give all the credit to the, the real cool part about Jabil is, is at an enterprise level, what we do is, in terms of our path is pretty, pretty, pretty simple. We build stuff. And, and we got the company broken up into eight segments. As you see, every time we get on one of these calls, or an investor day. And the strategies, the strategies are bottoms up, which I think is different than a lot of companies. And I love I love the I love the strategy that's been put in place with our automotive and transportation group. And it started a number of years ago, and they became hyper focused on a belief in electric vehicles. And we're starting to see that moving forward. I think that even with even with component constraints, through the back half of 2021, and certainly through a portion of 2022. When I when I when we meet with that group, we handicap it. We've got the -- supply chain dynamics going on, we're still looking at an auto, automotive and transportation, growth rate year-over-year north of 40%. And I think that I think that has to do with our solution set. I think that has to do with some very deep relationships we built in the EV space. And I think we're continuing to add to that and continuing to diversify that business. But all-in-all, as we sit today, our automotive business, if you go back to, let's say fiscal 18, 19, it was about $1.5 billion business. And we think going forward, that will be a $3.5 billion, $4 billion business for us. And again, I think it's a reflection of the service offerings and largely in the EV space.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nMark Mondello: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good morning. Two questions from me. First of all, I'm just curious, like, with new variants of COVID, how you budget that into different factory attendance, utilization going forward. It looks like maybe you could have more people with COVID, hopefully with less serious symptoms, but they'd still be out of work for a little while. And then secondly, Mark, the healthcare business is turning into this boring, but very nice growth business. I'm just curious where you think you are on the on the margin trajectory, whether it is for the margin upside, and anything you would highlight in the quarter? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Yes. First off, we hope to see you down here in Tampa, I think you're I think your team's playing in the Outback Bowl. So let us know if you're, if you're going to pop down in terms of in terms of gear, in terms of your question. The COVID situation, our team's done a first rate job. We, as we as we were going through the back half of 2021, we had, we had cases, largely driven on the Delta variant all over the world. And we were able to serve our customers do so really, really well. Not without some pain points. But again, I don't like to, I don't want to I don't want to start with our financial results. I want to start with the fact that we did a great job serving customers and an outcome for that was through it all, fiscal 2021. And for that sake, fiscal 2020. I think we navigated everything quite well, especially considering our geographic region and the scale of the company. As we sit today, more with Omicron I, let's keep our fingers crossed that maybe it appears to be a bit more contagious. Maybe not as severe time will tell. But we continue to do a really, really nice job in terms of managing that as well. As we think about some of the disruptions we had in Southeast Asia disruptions are still there but not to the magnitude that we've seen in the past. So fingers crossed. As we think about China, Mexico, U.S., and Eastern Europe, as we sit today, disruptions on a relative basis. So let's just say, let's just say for the last 18 months of hard, hard COVID, we see some periodic issues, but disruptions, I think, today are less than they've been in the last 14, 18 months. We continue to promote vaccinations around the world. We continue to promote booster shots. We continue to try to provide those on site. We sat in a status meeting last week, where as we get to the end of this calendar year 70%, 75% of our employees will be vaccinated. So I think that's helpful. I think we drive a lot of awareness. And then we also have very discipline protocols inside of our factories, mass or otherwise. I think all that is, is helping and, again, let's, let's keep good thoughts about, about this next derivation of, of the virus and, and hopefully, as we get into Calendar 2022, it will be manageable, like it has been the last couple years. In terms of our healthcare business, I would, I don't know that I'd call it boring. I think, I think I take that term as a positive where I take boring as consistent and reliable. And, boy, if that's the context to which you're for that. It, I think it's spot on. Here's a business where in fiscal 2019, we thought we would do about $3 billion in the healthcare space, we overshot that by $100 million $200 million. And in 2020, and 2021, we grew past $4 billion. And, and our healthcare and packaging business, as we reflected today, the beginning of the year, we thought we would do about $5 billion. And those numbers are holding. And by the way, that's with the handicap on the supply chain dynamics, and what the team's doing there has gone so far beyond base electronics, when you think about all the things we're doing in the pharma space, when you think about what we're doing in terms of precision machining, and then also next evolution, 3D printing in terms of orthopaedics, it's, it's really, really fascinating to me. So it's an area of our business that gets a lot of attention, both internally and externally. And it's very, very material to the next couple of years for the company.\nSteven Fox: Great, that's really helpful. Happy holidays.\nMark Mondello: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please proceed with your question.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much, two for me as well. I guess the first is, in conversations with several companies that cover the managements are talking about looking to longer term contracts with the supply chain, sort of changing the, the discussions they are having to lock in business on a longer term basis. So I'm curious if you've heard that I know some of this is component based, but I think it also just goes to broader supply chain challenges. And I don't know if you can talk about it, but I'm curious, what percent of revenue is sort of locked in for a given quarter, at the start of the quarter, or maybe when we think about guidance for the full year. What percent of the year is locked in on the first day of the fiscal year? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Shannon. I would say on the speculation or rumors or fact that you're hearing in terms of people locking in allocations, both component and then maybe capacity for Jabil. I -- we sit kind of in the middle of all of that. And as I mentioned on one of the prior questions, I think a lot of our customers do a really nice job. They do things independent. We do things independent for them, and we bring our thoughts together. And then we have a lot of relationships where we work all of this collaboratively. And by the way, that's becoming more and more because of our tools. And I would say that with this most recent supply chain disruption has driven is there is a significant amount of activity going on today, where we\u2019re already modeling, what if scenarios, and demand planning, which would result in allocation for late calendar 2022, and into the first half of 2023. So I think that people are trying to get out in front of it. Again, we're doing a lot of what if scenarios, and I think people are trying to do a better job with forward looking communication in terms of [Indiscernible] their overall demand and their needs, maybe 18 to 24 months out where maybe previously, for some companies, it might have been more like six to nine months out. And again, I think some of the data analytic tools are helping with that. In terms of, what percentage of our revenue is booked or secured going into a quarter. I would say, I don't know, 98% of our revenue going into a quarter. So as we're sitting here today. So here we sit on November, whatever today is 16, into our 2Q. And let's just say 95%, 98% of the revenues booked, it's just a matter of execution. And that's not always so simple. But I think we do that pretty well. So I think a very high percentage, as we have calls giving guide for the quarters. I think where some of the distortion comes in relative to Jabil is I think we tend, I think we've proven that we tend to be a bit conservative, sometimes in the top line guide, where we try to handicap a little bit of everything. And we've kind of gotten into this mode where revenue comes in a little bit harder than we expected sometimes. And again, we're trying to get better at that. But in this environment, with things being so dynamic, I think we try to be sure we handicap it properly. And then Shannon, in terms of the year I would also say that maybe a critique [ph] of myself and Mike is the last couple of years feels like maybe we've been hypersensitive to handicap in the year because last year, from what we said at the beginning of the year, we ended up driving a bit higher revenue. I think the same was in 20. I would if I had to guess today because of the supply chain challenges, we probably won't have revenue run away from us, I think we feel good about the 31 eight, and it's some of the supply chain issues. Clear up faster, I think the 31 eight turns into 32 or maybe a little bit more. So all-in-all, with, with what we do how we do it, I think we're I think we're typically in pretty good shape for a quarter. And I think we do a pretty good job for the year on the top line.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you, that was really helpful. I'm wondering, from a bigger picture standpoint, from long term planning, I guess. Are there areas, once we get past, if we get past whatever we're going through in supply chain and COVID aware, there you're looking at big CapEx projects or new segments on technology. I'm just I'm wondering sort of, how you think about the next several years, or are you just extremely focused, as everybody is right now on kind of getting through this period of time. So I don't know maybe how you're doing long term planning in the days of COVID right now.\nMark Mondello: I'd start with the supply chain issues are going to, we're going to get to the other side of the supply chain issues. It's a matter of when, but that's 100% for sure. Because there's going to be normalization between demand and supply that's going to get remedied 100% fact just matter when. In terms of all the COVID thing, I don't know how that all ends, maybe we end up fortunate where ends up being flu like, and we just learned to live with it. So I don't want to speculate on that. In terms of how we run the business, I think, I think we run in a couple of different dimensions. We try to be again, we lead with obsessing around solutions and services for our customers and we believe that with the commitments we make to customers, those commitments are then rolled into a financial forecast and then we and then we handicap or haircut that a little bit with good management judgment. So if we if we continue to do what we say and deliver for customers, the financial results tend to be an output of that. And, and boy, we obsess about that on a weekly, daily, monthly basis in terms of maybe a little bit bigger picture on CapEx and whatnot, we're focused on we're focused on, there's an endless amount of things. When you think about how big the market is, in terms of building stuff, the market is just substantial. And so there's more stuff out there than we can possibly do, which I think is a good thing. And so, based on how the platform and the company looks today, and how well diversified we are today, and by the way, that wasn't the case, 10 years ago, we're really being disciplined in terms of what we do, why we do it starting with, do we add great value. And if we add good to great value, again, the financials are an outcome of that. And then from that, we also the next derivative of that is, is we do have an obligation both to ourselves internally, as well as shareholders in terms of margin construct, as well as cash flow generation. So those are the filters that we use in terms of, do we spend a lot of time thinking three to four years out? We do. But I think we start with the fact that with how we're positioned today, what we do for customers, all the customers that are out there, and again, in generally just how big the market is, in terms of things that need to be built. We don't obsess around the size of the market. We, I think that's going to be there. It's really about the makeup of the company, the margin structure, hopefully the advancement of margins, and then, and then we're going to be in really good shape if we continue to generate strong cash flows, because those cash flows continue to reduce our net debt position. And it gives us an awful lot of optionality in terms of capital allocation over the next three to four years.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you very much.\nMark Mondello: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And, great quarter looks like a record in, in revenue and operating profit, despite challenging environments, so great job there. Just to follow up on, customer premises on facilities, location. So what occurs when a customer decides to move a line from China or some other location in Asia, or even moved to North America, you can talk about kind of the incremental costs of that move, and how that gets allocated, you kind of pass on most of that cost to the customer, is this kind of a margin cash neutral move for, for the company? And are those discussions kind of accelerating? Or a lot of customers kind of in wait and see mode.\nMark Mondello: Thanks for the question, Paul. I think, I'd start with there's nobody better in the world. And I don't make bold statements like this. There's nobody, there's nobody better in terms of giving optionality to customers in terms of what geography their product gets built. And I say that largely because if we're not the largest, when it we\u2019re one of the largest manufacturing services company in the world today with a broad based footprint, and the art around your question is really around the hard assets, our global footprint, the broad based nature of that footprint, and then the fact that we wrap really sophisticated IT systems around that footprint, in a very, very consistent way, which also is very unique, especially when combined with our ability and our scale. So and it's an on-going iterative process. So we talked earlier in Q&A around the fact that there's been catalysts over the last couple of years. Going back to when Trump was in the office in the U.S. and the geopolitical issues and the macro issues and the supply chain issues. So there's been some it's always been in our business. I think it's been maybe more prevalent the last 24 months, 36 months, something like that. But how it gets done is, is we're continually rerunning and re running and re running the data analytics for customers working side by side with them on an absolute scale in a perfect world, as we look at their product roadmaps and their overall endpoint consumptions, here's what an optimal supply chain looks like and there tends to be a lot of variables that are all different for each product that go into those models. And then we end up having great practical conversations with the customers. In terms of who bears the cost on that it depends. If assets are fungible, reusable, a lot of times that we\u2019ll bear the cost and that. If assets tend to be unique, difficult to move, have to be recreated, redundancies needed, things like that, we end up having appropriate commercial discussions with our customers. But again, if one were to if one were to take a proxy or a wide range conversation with our customers in terms of this part of our business, I think it's something we do really, really well, I think it's very good value. And, and it also, overall, when companies do get concerned around backup plans or redundancy plans, knowing that this is an area that we do especially well, I think gives a lot of our customers good comfort.\nPaul Chung: Thanks. And then last question, can you kind of provide an update on the pricing environment? You mentioned very strong demand ahead of supply. So are you kind of raising prices in certain areas? And then how's the competitive pricing environment kind of evolving, particularly with new customers? Are you seeing any acceleration of new customers as they want to kind of outsource the complexities of supply chain logistics, etcetera? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: I\u2019d start first with I think during our investor day in September, I made a comment. I think I made the comment. Our organic pipeline today is substantial. So in, in answering your question in terms of are we adding new customers, we're always adding new customers. Again, I think that's a reflection of I think that's a reflection of the size of the market. But I think, again, if our pipeline, if our pipeline is call it $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion, organically we plan to try to confirm and book a decent portion of that for the next for FY 23, 24. In terms of, are we raising prices? I don't know that I look at it that way. The way I look at it is I think our margin expansion is not coming from anything to do with raising prices it has to do with the total holistic makeup of the company. What we are doing is, we're not in a high margin business, as all of you know. And we can't bear the cost when the macro, inflationary, transitory, permanent, whatever it may be. When hard costs start to move against us, I think we do a very good job of sharing that with our customers. And so I look at it more on based on the data, based on the macro, based on the facts we do a good job of sharing, increasing costs. I don't look at it so much as being out there raising prices.\nPaul Chung: Thank you.\nMark Mondello: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. With that we do thank you and appreciate your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning. I'll begin today by thanking our folks here at Jabil for making safety, their personal priority. I'd also like to recognize their hard work and tireless commitment, which drove solid results for our first fiscal quarter. Again, thank you. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I'd like to wish all of you a safe and peaceful holiday season. With that, let's move to our next slide. Where I'd like to expand on what Mike and Adam addressed in their prepared remarks. Not only did our team deliver a favorable first quarter, but the diversification of our business was fundamental to the results. With each sector having a material contribution in the solutions we offer our customers and with each sector having a material contribution to our financial results. Specifically, the four sectors in our DMS segment focus on margins while offering reliable cash flows. While the four sectors in our EMS segment focus on cash flows, while offering reliable margins, a perfect complement as the well diversified construct of Jabil continues to drive our execution. If we dig a little deeper, we find secular trends embedded within certain sectors. Secular markets, where we now play and have a substantial presence. We believe these markets will drive our growth, with the overwhelming majority of such growth occurring organically, as we placed our attention on secular opportunities, opportunities such as 5G, electric vehicles, personalized health care, cloud computing, and clean energy. Furthermore, our commercial portfolio is intentional, and we think quite special. Each slice of this pie harbors domain expertise, affording us an essential collection of valuable capabilities. Although what's most impactful is the way in which we merge these capabilities with precision and speed as we serve our customers. Our approach is further enhanced by seamless collaboration across the organization combined with our unique Jabil structure. And when done correctly, we simplify the complex for many of the world's most remarkable brands. And we do so as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built, and supply chains need to be optimized.  One of the key outcomes of our approach is the fact that with each passing year, our results become less dependent on any single product or product family, which improves our resiliency, especially during times of macro disruption, and cyclical demand. I'll now take you through an update to our fiscal 2022 financial plan where you'll see the continued earnings power of the company. We've increased core earnings per share to $6.55 for the year, up $0.20 from our September outlook. We've also increased revenue to $31.8 billion, up from our initial guide of $31.5 billion. In addition, we're committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of $700 million while maintaining a core margin of 4.5% for the year as we navigate this challenging environment. In concert with these strong numbers, please note that our path forward is well understood throughout the company. And what needs to be done remains crystal clear. Quite simply, what we're doing is working a positive testament on how our team is managing the business. Moving on from the financials, I'd like to talk about purpose. At Jabil, purpose serves as our guidepost. When we think about purpose, we think about our behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, servant leadership, DE&I, protecting the environment, and getting back to the many communities where we live. Please note that these behaviors as displayed by our team are exceptional. In closing, our improvement is steady and our strategy is consistent. And as a team, we value our role as a responsible and reliable partner to those we serve. All-in-all, I feel good about where we've been. But I feel even better about where we're going. In simple terms, at Jabil we build stuff and we do so really, really well. We also solve problems over and over again, that's why we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. I want each of you to always be your true self without fear or anxiety as you care for one another. To everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Adam. Hey Ruplu thanks for the question. I don't -- I don't know that we really look at it that way. How I would answer it maybe would be maybe getting away from Q1. And I'm not doing that for any reason other than I kind of think about the year a bit deeper. I'd say that we've taken the year now from 31, five to 31, eight. I think that's up from like 29 three last year. And I think we've done a really good job, spending a lot of time with our commercial folks, our operations folks, and our supply chain procurement folks. So I believe that we've handicapped supply chain properly, to deliver the 31 eight. I guess in an unconstrained environment. I don't know maybe the maybe the 31 eight would be somewhere 32 something in terms of top line. But again, I think we spend more time really kind of looking at our factories, looking at the looking at the pipeline of materials, and then a lot of communication and connectivity between our supply chain procurement folks, our operations folks and our commercial folks. So I think maybe the main takeaway is Simmons supply chain continues to be kind of bumpy and a bit unpredictable for the next couple of quarters. We believe we've handicap that properly to deliver the year, or said differently the 31.8 billion. In terms of when we see things getting better for -- I like the question because it allows me to give a shout out to our supply chain procurement team for what they did in, in in for 4Q of last year in Q1 of this year, in delivering the numbers, we overshot revenue by a 300 million for the quarter and a lot of that had to do with the whole team, but just tremendous work from the supply chain procurement group. I think that will continue to be in this environment and in one way, shape perform probably through the spring into early summer. But I think we start seeing things getting better six to nine months from now. Thanks, Jim. Trying to figure out timeframe. Let's keep with the three to four years you talked about. I'd say that -- I'd say for the last, I don't know, dozen years, we have a bunch of tools that have kind of migrated from manual tools to more digital tools to more data analytics as the company's matured and advanced forward, but tools nonetheless, where we've always gone from kind of manual spread sheets to the new digital tools in terms of optimizing supply chains for customers. Kind of the thesis of your question, though, around trade wars and tariffs and geopolitical issues and risk and COVID this and other issues. I would say that in the last 24 to 30 months, there has been a heightened sensitivity in terms of working with customers on a proactive basis to be sure that their overall supply chain manufacturing solutions are optimized derisks and as well as supportive with backup plans. So as an example, one of the things we talk about a lot is I think there's a huge advantage of building stuff when you have scale. And then you have diversification either top line or, or factories around the world. Today we're sitting in a in a really good place, because a lot of our customers put a lot of trust in Jabil. And we do the vast majority of their work. And even though they're inside a Jabil, we can provide fabulous redundancy plans if, if things go a bit sideways. So I'd say Jim, some of the things that you alluded to have been very real catalysts to, to maybe increase the priority in terms of supply chain and where we build stuff. And then the other neat thing about our tools today is with the advancement of the data analytics, and how we're positioned in the supply chain, both front end and back end, we also spend a significant amount of time with customers today, mapping their entire supply chain. So from the from the most basic precious metals through components, consideration to design, where the product is going to be manufactured, and then how it's going to be distributed. So I'd say all-in-all today, it's perpetual, I don't think it's ever done. But I think to your point, we've done an awful lot of work. And there's been a lot of prime catalysts for that type of work to be done. And I think overall, we do a pretty good job in that area for our customers. Thanks, Jim, you as well. Thanks Mark. I think that let me start with factor utilization. I think factor utilization in 4Q and Q1 was mixed and choppy. We had and the biggest issue there is again, the supply chain dynamics. So I wouldn't conclude, I wouldn't conclude that any portion or a material portion of our results was due to hype or factory utilization. In fact, I think it was maybe a little bit of the opposite. So let's just call that let's just call that maybe a very slight net negative through Q1. And yet the results I think we're very, very good. If I then move, if I then move through, maybe the back half, somehow we've posted Q1, we've given you a fairly explicit numbers for Q2. If I think about the back half of the year, as I think about margins, I think the back half of fiscal 2021 margins for the whole company were around 4%. If I think about the back half of 2022, the overall margins for the company are going to be 30, 40 basis points greater than that. And I think that's a good indication of the composition of the business mix today, and where we're focused. And one of the things that we did in the slide deck today and the prepared remarks between Adam, Mike and myself is we're reinforcing the 4.5% for the year, by the way, when again, a decent portion of the year is going to be fraught with supply chain challenges. So that's up 30 basis points from last year, which last year was I think, a pretty good year for us. And I think where you're going is beyond this year, I don't want to get into too much speculation about where the business might be going in 2023 and 2024. Although, I made a comment sometime, I don't remember when sometime in the last 12 months or something like that during the JPMorgan conference, the question came up, and we were going back and forth, talking about kind of the midterm outlook for the company. And I suggested that, we were a company where we focus the vast, vast majority of our growth organically. We're not big on big M&A deals. And if that continues, and we continue to be successful in the marketplace, I do think we're on a trajectory where margins can be above the four and a half, I think maybe next step would be 46, 47. And, our internal efforts are going to be around running the company at 5% on the income line. Well, I think we've -- if I choose to go all the way back to I go all the way back to, to an acquisition we made that has been proven quite good for us, both in knowledge in terms of R&D, which is active alignment on sensors, as well as optics. And we think that's, we think that's a really nice tool to have in our toolset because it cuts across so many different end markets. It's everything from consumer on kind of the consumer robotics side. It's in retail in terms of our robots in terms of the retail space. And it's certainly helping us in terms of autonomous driving in and the EV market. And they are also using it in some areas of industrial. So I think that when I think about I think in my prepared remarks, I'd talked about kind of how we weave together kind of a library full of capabilities, the act of alignment sensors, and optic sight is, is important part of that. And again, we like it because it's not pigeon holed into one particular business or one particular sector. It cuts across probably 50% of our eight sectors. So it's something that can be leveraged quite well. Thanks Mark. Hey, Matt, can you help me a little bit? So the 4% being what if I heard you correctly? You talking about -- You're not talking about op margin? You're talking about growth? Venture my growth rate for on the Q2? Okay. When you started, I was getting a little bit confused on whether you were talking about the... Yes. I think that's, I think that's based on two things. I think it's largely based on I think that there's distortion in the comps year-on-year because last year with various product roadmaps and whatnot in DMS. They were a little bit different. And so I think the year-on-year comps are a little bit distortive. I would say if I back up and open the aperture a little bit who I really like. I really like the DMS construct and aside from the Q2 year-on-year comp, we still think and I think it was shown this way on the blue green slide that our DMS business is still going to grow 10% And that's at significant scale. So I appreciate the question because it is a it is a it is a one off I think every single quarter this year we'll be bumping up against double digits except for Q2. And again, largely due to the fact that I think Q2 of 21 was a little bit of an odd comp. Yes, well, first off, I'd give, I'd give all the credit to the, the real cool part about Jabil is, is at an enterprise level, what we do is, in terms of our path is pretty, pretty, pretty simple. We build stuff. And, and we got the company broken up into eight segments. As you see, every time we get on one of these calls, or an investor day. And the strategies, the strategies are bottoms up, which I think is different than a lot of companies. And I love I love the I love the strategy that's been put in place with our automotive and transportation group. And it started a number of years ago, and they became hyper focused on a belief in electric vehicles. And we're starting to see that moving forward. I think that even with even with component constraints, through the back half of 2021, and certainly through a portion of 2022. When I when I when we meet with that group, we handicap it. We've got the -- supply chain dynamics going on, we're still looking at an auto, automotive and transportation, growth rate year-over-year north of 40%. And I think that I think that has to do with our solution set. I think that has to do with some very deep relationships we built in the EV space. And I think we're continuing to add to that and continuing to diversify that business. But all-in-all, as we sit today, our automotive business, if you go back to, let's say fiscal 18, 19, it was about $1.5 billion business. And we think going forward, that will be a $3.5 billion, $4 billion business for us. And again, I think it's a reflection of the service offerings and largely in the EV space. You're welcome. Yes. First off, we hope to see you down here in Tampa, I think you're I think your team's playing in the Outback Bowl. So let us know if you're, if you're going to pop down in terms of in terms of gear, in terms of your question. The COVID situation, our team's done a first rate job. We, as we as we were going through the back half of 2021, we had, we had cases, largely driven on the Delta variant all over the world. And we were able to serve our customers do so really, really well. Not without some pain points. But again, I don't like to, I don't want to I don't want to start with our financial results. I want to start with the fact that we did a great job serving customers and an outcome for that was through it all, fiscal 2021. And for that sake, fiscal 2020. I think we navigated everything quite well, especially considering our geographic region and the scale of the company. As we sit today, more with Omicron I, let's keep our fingers crossed that maybe it appears to be a bit more contagious. Maybe not as severe time will tell. But we continue to do a really, really nice job in terms of managing that as well. As we think about some of the disruptions we had in Southeast Asia disruptions are still there but not to the magnitude that we've seen in the past. So fingers crossed. As we think about China, Mexico, U.S., and Eastern Europe, as we sit today, disruptions on a relative basis. So let's just say, let's just say for the last 18 months of hard, hard COVID, we see some periodic issues, but disruptions, I think, today are less than they've been in the last 14, 18 months. We continue to promote vaccinations around the world. We continue to promote booster shots. We continue to try to provide those on site. We sat in a status meeting last week, where as we get to the end of this calendar year 70%, 75% of our employees will be vaccinated. So I think that's helpful. I think we drive a lot of awareness. And then we also have very discipline protocols inside of our factories, mass or otherwise. I think all that is, is helping and, again, let's, let's keep good thoughts about, about this next derivation of, of the virus and, and hopefully, as we get into Calendar 2022, it will be manageable, like it has been the last couple years. In terms of our healthcare business, I would, I don't know that I'd call it boring. I think, I think I take that term as a positive where I take boring as consistent and reliable. And, boy, if that's the context to which you're for that. It, I think it's spot on. Here's a business where in fiscal 2019, we thought we would do about $3 billion in the healthcare space, we overshot that by $100 million $200 million. And in 2020, and 2021, we grew past $4 billion. And, and our healthcare and packaging business, as we reflected today, the beginning of the year, we thought we would do about $5 billion. And those numbers are holding. And by the way, that's with the handicap on the supply chain dynamics, and what the team's doing there has gone so far beyond base electronics, when you think about all the things we're doing in the pharma space, when you think about what we're doing in terms of precision machining, and then also next evolution, 3D printing in terms of orthopaedics, it's, it's really, really fascinating to me. So it's an area of our business that gets a lot of attention, both internally and externally. And it's very, very material to the next couple of years for the company. Thank you. Thanks, Shannon. I would say on the speculation or rumors or fact that you're hearing in terms of people locking in allocations, both component and then maybe capacity for Jabil. I -- we sit kind of in the middle of all of that. And as I mentioned on one of the prior questions, I think a lot of our customers do a really nice job. They do things independent. We do things independent for them, and we bring our thoughts together. And then we have a lot of relationships where we work all of this collaboratively. And by the way, that's becoming more and more because of our tools. And I would say that with this most recent supply chain disruption has driven is there is a significant amount of activity going on today, where we're already modeling, what if scenarios, and demand planning, which would result in allocation for late calendar 2022, and into the first half of 2023. So I think that people are trying to get out in front of it. Again, we're doing a lot of what if scenarios, and I think people are trying to do a better job with forward looking communication in terms of [Indiscernible] their overall demand and their needs, maybe 18 to 24 months out where maybe previously, for some companies, it might have been more like six to nine months out. And again, I think some of the data analytic tools are helping with that. In terms of, what percentage of our revenue is booked or secured going into a quarter. I would say, I don't know, 98% of our revenue going into a quarter. So as we're sitting here today. So here we sit on November, whatever today is 16, into our 2Q. And let's just say 95%, 98% of the revenues booked, it's just a matter of execution. And that's not always so simple. But I think we do that pretty well. So I think a very high percentage, as we have calls giving guide for the quarters. I think where some of the distortion comes in relative to Jabil is I think we tend, I think we've proven that we tend to be a bit conservative, sometimes in the top line guide, where we try to handicap a little bit of everything. And we've kind of gotten into this mode where revenue comes in a little bit harder than we expected sometimes. And again, we're trying to get better at that. But in this environment, with things being so dynamic, I think we try to be sure we handicap it properly. And then Shannon, in terms of the year I would also say that maybe a critique [ph] of myself and Mike is the last couple of years feels like maybe we've been hypersensitive to handicap in the year because last year, from what we said at the beginning of the year, we ended up driving a bit higher revenue. I think the same was in 20. I would if I had to guess today because of the supply chain challenges, we probably won't have revenue run away from us, I think we feel good about the 31 eight, and it's some of the supply chain issues. Clear up faster, I think the 31 eight turns into 32 or maybe a little bit more. So all-in-all, with, with what we do how we do it, I think we're I think we're typically in pretty good shape for a quarter. And I think we do a pretty good job for the year on the top line. I'd start with the supply chain issues are going to, we're going to get to the other side of the supply chain issues. It's a matter of when, but that's 100% for sure. Because there's going to be normalization between demand and supply that's going to get remedied 100% fact just matter when. In terms of all the COVID thing, I don't know how that all ends, maybe we end up fortunate where ends up being flu like, and we just learned to live with it. So I don't want to speculate on that. In terms of how we run the business, I think, I think we run in a couple of different dimensions. We try to be again, we lead with obsessing around solutions and services for our customers and we believe that with the commitments we make to customers, those commitments are then rolled into a financial forecast and then we and then we handicap or haircut that a little bit with good management judgment. So if we if we continue to do what we say and deliver for customers, the financial results tend to be an output of that. And, and boy, we obsess about that on a weekly, daily, monthly basis in terms of maybe a little bit bigger picture on CapEx and whatnot, we're focused on we're focused on, there's an endless amount of things. When you think about how big the market is, in terms of building stuff, the market is just substantial. And so there's more stuff out there than we can possibly do, which I think is a good thing. And so, based on how the platform and the company looks today, and how well diversified we are today, and by the way, that wasn't the case, 10 years ago, we're really being disciplined in terms of what we do, why we do it starting with, do we add great value. And if we add good to great value, again, the financials are an outcome of that. And then from that, we also the next derivative of that is, is we do have an obligation both to ourselves internally, as well as shareholders in terms of margin construct, as well as cash flow generation. So those are the filters that we use in terms of, do we spend a lot of time thinking three to four years out? We do. But I think we start with the fact that with how we're positioned today, what we do for customers, all the customers that are out there, and again, in generally just how big the market is, in terms of things that need to be built. We don't obsess around the size of the market. We, I think that's going to be there. It's really about the makeup of the company, the margin structure, hopefully the advancement of margins, and then, and then we're going to be in really good shape if we continue to generate strong cash flows, because those cash flows continue to reduce our net debt position. And it gives us an awful lot of optionality in terms of capital allocation over the next three to four years. Yes, thank you. Thanks for the question, Paul. I think, I'd start with there's nobody better in the world. And I don't make bold statements like this. There's nobody, there's nobody better in terms of giving optionality to customers in terms of what geography their product gets built. And I say that largely because if we're not the largest, when it we're one of the largest manufacturing services company in the world today with a broad based footprint, and the art around your question is really around the hard assets, our global footprint, the broad based nature of that footprint, and then the fact that we wrap really sophisticated IT systems around that footprint, in a very, very consistent way, which also is very unique, especially when combined with our ability and our scale. So and it's an on-going iterative process. So we talked earlier in Q&A around the fact that there's been catalysts over the last couple of years. Going back to when Trump was in the office in the U.S. and the geopolitical issues and the macro issues and the supply chain issues. So there's been some it's always been in our business. I think it's been maybe more prevalent the last 24 months, 36 months, something like that. But how it gets done is, is we're continually rerunning and re running and re running the data analytics for customers working side by side with them on an absolute scale in a perfect world, as we look at their product roadmaps and their overall endpoint consumptions, here's what an optimal supply chain looks like and there tends to be a lot of variables that are all different for each product that go into those models. And then we end up having great practical conversations with the customers. In terms of who bears the cost on that it depends. If assets are fungible, reusable, a lot of times that we'll bear the cost and that. If assets tend to be unique, difficult to move, have to be recreated, redundancies needed, things like that, we end up having appropriate commercial discussions with our customers. But again, if one were to if one were to take a proxy or a wide range conversation with our customers in terms of this part of our business, I think it's something we do really, really well, I think it's very good value. And, and it also, overall, when companies do get concerned around backup plans or redundancy plans, knowing that this is an area that we do especially well, I think gives a lot of our customers good comfort. I'd start first with I think during our investor day in September, I made a comment. I think I made the comment. Our organic pipeline today is substantial. So in, in answering your question in terms of are we adding new customers, we're always adding new customers. Again, I think that's a reflection of I think that's a reflection of the size of the market. But I think, again, if our pipeline, if our pipeline is call it $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion, organically we plan to try to confirm and book a decent portion of that for the next for FY 23, 24. In terms of, are we raising prices? I don't know that I look at it that way. The way I look at it is I think our margin expansion is not coming from anything to do with raising prices it has to do with the total holistic makeup of the company. What we are doing is, we're not in a high margin business, as all of you know. And we can't bear the cost when the macro, inflationary, transitory, permanent, whatever it may be. When hard costs start to move against us, I think we do a very good job of sharing that with our customers. And so I look at it more on based on the data, based on the macro, based on the facts we do a good job of sharing, increasing costs. I don't look at it so much as being out there raising prices. You're welcome."

            "content": "Thank you, Adam. And thank you for joining us today. As Adam just highlighted Q1 was an exceptional quarter. The team delivered strong results on three fronts; revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share. Our results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end market strength and excellent operation execution by the entire Jabil team along with lower tax and interest expense. Net revenue for the first quarter was $8.6 billion, up 9.4% over the prior quarter. GAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.92, a 20% improvement over the prior quarter. Now turning to our first quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.7 billion and increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis. The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad based, the strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses. Core margin for the segment came in at 5.4%. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.9 billion, an increase of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. For stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad based with strength across our digital print retail, industrial and semi cap and 5G wireless and cloud businesses. Core margin for the segment was 3.8%, 40 basis points higher than the prior reflecting solid execution by the team. Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q1, inventory days came in at 66 days decline a five day sequentially. The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment and I expect over the medium to longer term our inventory days to normalize below 60. Cash flows used in operations were $46 million in Q1, and net capital expenditures totalled $73 million. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels to approximately 1.3 times and cash balances of $1.2 billion. During Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares or $127 million. Turning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 4% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion, while EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to $3.6 billion. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.7 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $290 million to $350 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $266 million to $326 million. Core related earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.55. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.39. The tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 24%. Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, both segments are in incredibly good shape. In September, I highlighted several long term sustainable secular trends in strategically important end markets, such as healthcare, automotive, cloud, semi cap, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices along with power generation and energy storage. For the remainder of FY 2022 and beyond, we continue to expect these secular trends to drive strong growth. Our electric vehicle business in particular continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues, as the transition to ED [ph] accelerates. And importantly, a broad based growth associated with the secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin expansion in both segments, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong financial results for FY 2022. And a balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long term value creation to shareholders. I would like to wish each and every one of you a safe and happy holiday. Thank you for your time today. And thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Ruplu, I've sort of moved in the same direction as in previous years and previous quarters. In past years, the trend will be pretty similar, the seasonality attached to our free cash flow. So that doesn't change much through these times. We do expect the supply chain constraints to open up a little bit. And in Q4, I think the cash flow will be a lot higher. So I think overall, similar trends to last year with a slightly stronger performance in Q4 is the best way to model that group. Sure Ruplu. So we have on buybacks, we have a billion dollar authorization. I think we still have about, I think it's about 830 million of that authorization left. We'll continue to be well balanced in our capital allocation. I personally feel the stock is still highly undervalued. So buyback will be an integral part of our capital allocation framework. M&A, as we've done in the past Ruplu, we've done tuck-in, M&A's capability driven M&As. And I think in September we highlighted a little bit of a capital allocation framework there as well. At this stage, no changes to that M&A, tuck-ins will continue as we as we progress through the year. Tax, so for Q2, I think we've said 24% in that range Ruplu the reason it was it was good as purely because of the mix, issue. income coming through in different jurisdictions where in 30 countries, so there's a lot of moving parts, but in that 24% range, should be to be a good guide for now. Thanks, Ruplu."

For the sixth straight year, we're going to use this session today to accomplish the following: review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results; discuss the trends underway within the end markets we serve; provide an update for our pending transaction to sell the Mobility business to BYD Electronics; refresh our capital allocation policy given the pending deal; offer a thoughtful fiscal '24 outlook that demonstrates enterprise level growth in some key areas while also remaining sensible and grounded given the realities of the dynamic global macro environment surrounding us today; and finally, we'll do our very best to walk through the many moving pieces we foresee in the upcoming year as we work to make our business more profitable and more sustainable. But before we jump into the details, please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with these slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted there for audio playback. I'd now like to ask that you follow our presentation with slides on the website beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our fourth quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.5 billion in revenue, equal to the midpoint of our guidance range. Core operating income for the quarter came in stronger than expected at $477 million, or 5.6% of revenue. This is up 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis and 80 basis points sequentially, driven by strong execution across both segments. Net interest expense in the quarter came in better than expected at $71 million, reflecting good progress by the team on inventory and solid working capital management. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $441 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.15. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.45, a 5% improvement over the prior year, and towards the upper end of our guidance range. Revenue for the DMS segment came in better than expected at $4.4 billion, up marginally compared to the same timeframe from a year ago, driven by strength in our Auto and Healthcare businesses. This strength was completely offset by continued weakness in Connected Devices. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 6.1%, 100 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, given the solid mix and the normal seasonal pattern within our Mobility business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4 billion, down roughly 13% year-over-year and approximately $200 million below expectations. As expected, during the quarter, we saw a major revenue shift in our cloud business, driven by our previously announced transition of certain components we procure and integrate to a customer-controlled consignment service model. In Q4, the overall mix of consigned components came in higher than expected. For the quarter, core margins for EMS were 5.2%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strength in renewables, which is in our industrial portion of our business, and the aforementioned consignment shift. In fiscal '23, our DMS segment revenue was $18 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. In particular, it's worth highlighting our Automotive and Healthcare businesses, which were up 42% and 12%, respectively. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. In EMS, core margins for the year were strong, also coming in at 5%, 70 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $16.7 billion. The strength in fiscal '23 income was driven by growth in renewables within our Industrial and Semi-Cap market as well as the benefit from consignment. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Beginning with inventory, which saw good improvement sequentially by four days to 80 days. More importantly, net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were also down four days to 58 in Q4. Our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were strong, coming in at $686 million. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $28 million and, for the full fiscal year, came in lower than expected at $708 million, mainly due to the timing of CapEx payments that are shifting to Q1 from Q4. As a result of the strong fourth quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the year came in higher than expected at approximately $1 billion. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.8 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.1 times. For the year, we repurchased 6.7 million shares for $487 million, leaving us with $776 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of August 31. Please note that in Q4, we were out of the repurchase market mostly as a result of the pending Mobility deal. As Mike will share in a few minutes, when our opportunity to buy back reopens, we plan to accelerate repurchases in Q1 fiscal '24. As I flip to the next slide, looking at the five-year financials, it's hard to believe that another year is in the books for Jabil. And as I look ahead, I can't help but think that there's so much more opportunity ahead for us. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Kenny, Fred, and Mike, but before I do, I want to spend a few minutes setting the stage for what you're going to hear today. Over the next couple minutes, I think you're going to hear a lot of the same from us. From a financial target perspective, you're going to hear us talk about winning our unfair share of business and leveraging those wins to drive margin expansion, free cash flow generation, and further shareholder return. From an end market perspective, you're going to hear more about the areas of our business which continue to see solid double-digit growth and why we believe we're one of the best positioned companies to benefit from global trends such as electric and autonomous driving, digital healthcare, AI infrastructure, and the long-term shift to renewable energy. But there's some new dynamics to share today as well, and as a team, we're excited to share a few key updates. For starters, you may have noticed that our previously announced transaction to sell our Mobility business to BYD Electronics has moved from the preliminary stages of agreement to a definitive agreement, as announced earlier this week. As we move through our session today, you'll hear from both Kenny and Mike as they weave the strategic rationale and financial impact into our economic model. At the same time, we have some updates to provide today on capital allocation framework, given that the Mobility definitive agreement is now in place. And then given that fiscal '24 will be transitional for Jabil, in terms of closing the Mobility transaction and the subsequent planned accelerated buybacks, Mike will offer a viewpoint of fiscal '25, including the full impact of both initiatives. So, with that, I'll now hand it over to Kenny.\nKenny Wilson: Thanks, Adam. Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As Adam highlighted, fiscal year '23 was another strong year, and I am pleased with the progress we've made relative to our financial objectives. Every day at Jabil, we strive to do the right thing. It is how we are wired. So, it's heartening when looking at our end-of-year report card to see that we are making progress on all fronts. Most satisfying for me is the resilience of our model, where despite end market choppiness, we posted very impressive year-on-year growth in core margins, up 40 basis points to 5%, earnings up 12%, and EPS up 13%, while also driving in excess of $1 billion in free cash flows. This time of year also sees us complete our annual strategic planning process. And it is reassuring to note that similar to last year, we reconfirmed our focus on investing in key areas of our business, including electric vehicles and autonomous driving, AI cloud solutions, renewable energy and healthcare. All of this sets a firm foundation for fiscal year '24 and beyond, and is a testament to our customer-centric model, which is both robust and adaptable to changes in end market. The next slide shows how these characteristics have shaped the last 10 years. And seen in this context, fiscal '23 was just another step in the journey. If I was looking for one word to summarize activities highlighted, it would be intentionality. We have and will continue to be very intentional as we look to grow and modify the mix of business to include longer lifecycle industries like healthcare with the acquisition of Nypro and our strategic collaboration with JJMD. In addition, we have also increased investment, both organically and inorganically, in emerging technologies. We view our capabilities as a match for important end markets, like renewable energy, infrastructure, electric vehicles, and cloud data centers. From an enterprise perspective, we began materially redirecting more and more of our free cash flows to buybacks and reinvest in ourselves at very attractive valuations. And finally, just a few weeks back, we unveiled yet another step on our journey as we announced the pending divestiture of our Mobility business to BYD Electronics for $2.2 billion. As we move into fiscal year '24 and beyond, you can continue to rely on this leadership team to allocate capital with a view to expanding shareholder value. I'd now like to spend a little time talking about our decision to sell the Mobility business. As you know, over the past five years, I've had the privilege both to lead and work alongside some of the most skilled and talented manufacturing engineers, operations leaders and material scientists in the world. And during that time, we were fortunate to build an incredible business while also delivering best-in-class products for one of the world's greatest brands. I had the front row seat, unlike any other, to truly appreciate and develop a deep understanding of the level of complexity involved in introducing and manufacturing precision mechanics at huge scale for our largest customer. This perspective provides me some credibility to make the claim that our Mobility team is second to none when it comes to innovative automation, tooling design, and manufacturing of these components at scale. And I also truly believe this talented organization can reach new heights when their capability is matched by a supportive business model focused on significant growth. To all my friends in the Mobility business, I will miss you deeply. Thanks for showing your company at its best, for never flinching from the sometimes seemingly unsurmountable asks, and doing so all with humility, professionalism, and great skill. It has been my honor to be a part of your team. Looking forward, I think your particular skill sets can be leveraged in endless ways. And while it's bittersweet to say goodbye to some great friends and colleagues, I know this is the best route for our customers, employees, and shareholders alike. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Fred to go deeper into our end markets, but before that, I wanted to reaffirm what you can expect from me as CEO. I will work tirelessly on your behalf to ensure that we are in the correct end markets and geographies with the correct capabilities to serve our customers. I will continue to ensure that our capital allocation is shareholder friendly, while appropriately funding our growth. And all of this will be underpinned by an unwavering passion and commitment to preserve, protect and grow our unique culture, which is the foundation of everything that is great about our company. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Fred.\nFred McCoy: Thanks, Kenny. Good morning, everyone. As you've heard from Adam and Kenny, there's a lot going on at Jabil at the moment and quite a lot to be excited about. It's my privilege to join the call today and, over the next few minutes, to walk you through the demand dynamics inside our diversified markets and how we see each shaping up for the coming year. As we move into FY '24, we continue to expect growth in our business to be headlined by end markets that are benefiting from strong multi-year tailwinds, specifically renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, AI cloud data centers, and healthcare. Let's begin with what's going on in our Industrial and Semi-Cap end market on the next slide. In Industrial, we're experiencing robust growth in clean and smart energy infrastructure, as governments globally implement legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States to increase investment in new projects. As a reminder, we play across the entire energy value chain from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage, and metering, and to the management of power inside homes and buildings. These projects have multi-year investment timelines, independent of underlying short-term economic growth forecasts. So, we feel comfortable with the visibility we have in this space given these elongated infrastructure build-outs. As an example, a relatively new market that we're particularly excited about is the energy storage systems market, from grid level to inside the home and in support of rapid EV charging. On the back of several recent wins in the U.S. and Europe, we expect this space to drive solid growth in the coming years, leveraging our investments in battery module integration. We are well positioned to support growth in the renewable energy infrastructure space due to a unique combination of power engineering expertise, in-region manufacturing, and supply chain capabilities. As a result, we expect revenue for our industrial business to be up more than 20% in FY '24. Offsetting this growth slightly is our Semi-Cap business, as we anticipate market demand to remain muted for most of our fiscal year. As a reminder, our Semi-Cap business spans both front-end, with gear that turns wafer into chips, to the back-end with gear that inspects and tests the wafer or resulting chips. Our strategy in this end market has been very thoughtful due to the high cyclicality of the market, and we've been very focused around how we've invested in this business, expecting demand to remain muted in FY '24 while preparing the capabilities and regional footprint for us to be well positioned to grow when the market moves higher as end market demand rebounds. Within our Automotive and Transport business, we continue to expect growth to be driven by the global transition to electric vehicles. For FY '24, we expect another year of 20%-plus revenue growth, despite what is a choppy overall global demand environment. The global shift to EVs continues to accelerate, and we expect EVs to represent a larger share of the global auto market in FY '24, regardless of near-term global growth dynamics. In this space, we support an increasingly diverse set of the world's leading automotive OEMs as they launch new electric vehicle platforms across multiple geographies. Our focus areas in the EV market we refer to as ACES, or ADAS and autonomous, connectivity, electrification, and software-defined vehicle architecture. In the EV market, we support products such as compute and control modules, power conversion, battery management, optical camera modules, LiDAR, and other sensors, as well as charging solutions. The path to mass adoption of electric vehicles globally is exceedingly complex, and there are very few companies that are as well positioned as Jabil to support customers' multiple complex program ramps on multiple continents with industry-leading supply chain, design and manufacturing capabilities. Moving to cloud. Our cloud solutions continue to resonate with customers of all sizes, from large hyperscalers to Tier 2 cloud providers, such as technology companies and leading financial firms. Today, cloud represents a relatively small portion of overall global IT spend, but we expect secular growth in this area to accelerate, including the related data center infrastructure, especially with the proliferation of AI and ML. Next-generation clouds, and especially AI cloud data centers, present unique challenges to customers. AI workloads, which are powered by extremely powerful GPUs that consume significantly more energy and drive increased data generation. This creates three challenges: insufficient power supply on the grid to support expanded data center needs; heat generation that surpasses the capabilities of air-cooled data centers; and enhanced data interconnections between racks to support increased data inside the data center. Our design-to-dust capabilities continue to resonate with customers, and we are investing in the areas of data center infrastructure services, liquid cooling, and silicon photonics to help our customers solve the above challenges. Jabil is extremely well positioned to support customers as they incorporate innovative technologies into their data centers. And with the asset-light nature of the business, we have maximum flexibility to adapt and support customer needs around the world. We're already seeing success in this area. Jabil was recently awarded and began production of our largest cloud customers' artificial intelligence rack configurations that are GPU dense, which are consigned. Because these components are among those consigned, we will see year-over-year headwinds to revenue, especially in the first half of the year. In spite of the revenue decline, the underlying business and associated unit volumes, however, are expected to grow by more than 20% in FY '24. In Healthcare, we expect another robust growth year with revenue up 9% year-on-year. In the healthcare space, the range of products we design and manufacture lean into digital healthcare trends and include: highly complex diagnostic equipment and related consumables; orthopedics, including 3D printed implantables; precision health and medical devices, like minimally invasive devices; and pharma solutions, including smart injection delivery devices for diabetes and obesity drugs. Jabil's credibility in the healthcare space as the largest EMS provider in the space positions us well to take advantage of the outsourcing of manufacturing trends. In the coming years, we expect OEMs to continue to accelerate this outsourcing trend regardless of global macro growth. A recession-resistant end market with long product lifecycles and accretive margins and stable cash flows is why healthcare continues to be such a critical component of our diversified portfolio. Within Digital Print and Retail, we're seeing slower demand in legacy print and point of sale markets. This is being offset by growth in warehouse and retail automation markets, as we have a number of key wins that will be ramping in the back half of the fiscal year. These wins leverage unique capabilities in 3D printing of production components, robotics, engineering software and integration, and complex manufacturing automation. Our recent success shows we are well positioned in these end markets to help our customers bring next-generation automation technologies to market. Within our Networking and Storage end markets, we continue our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize margins and cash flows. We also expect overall market demand to be muted this year. Longer term, however, we anticipate growth coming from new programs in development for advanced optical networking, for high-performance data center interconnect that will support growth in cloud and AI data center applications. And finally within our Connected Devices business, demand remain soft, reflective of weakness in consumer goods spending. We expect another year of market... [Technical Difficulty]\nMike Dastoor: [Technical Difficulty] ...and set of capabilities to deliver for our customers. With that, let's turn to the next slide. We heard Fred take us through each of our end markets and how we plan to optimize this portfolio even further. We continue to benefit from multiple long-term secular growth end markets, such as electric vehicles, healthcare, renewables, and AI-driven cloud data centers. In fact, for FY '24, we expect these four end markets to make up nearly 70% of our FY '24 revenue mix, excluding the revenue associated with the Mobility sale. Upon closing the Mobility transaction, we no longer anticipate having any customer that represents 10% or more of revenue. The long-term viability of these end markets continues to give me a high level of confidence as we navigate a range of economic scenarios while expanding margins and free cash flows. Next slide. FY '24 is a pivotal year in our journey. After considering a range of scenarios with differing outcomes associated with the timing of the Mobility transaction close, we thought it might be helpful to provide a time-based range for FY '24 results including our Mobility business until the transaction close date and highlight the FY '25 outlook excluding Mobility and after considering the full impact of accelerated share repurchases. But before I do that, I'd like to walk you through some assumptions we have used, most of which we have already discussed on this call. For FY '24, we assume economic conditions remain challenged for the consumer, which we have reflected in our consumer-related end market guidance. In the coming year, we continue to optimize our end market portfolio in Networking and Storage. As Fred mentioned earlier, we began production of our largest cloud customers' artificial intelligence rack configurations. These racks are GPU dense and are among the components that have transitioned to a customer control consignment service model, which has effectively doubled the consignment percentage from a year ago. While volumes are expected to grow by more than 20%, we expect the shift to result in lower revenue as compared to last year of approximately $500 million in Q1 and approximately $200 million in Q2. Within our Mobility business in Q1, we expect the change in work content associated with new products to impact year-over-year revenue growth by approximately $300 million to $400 million. And finally, we anticipate the Mobility transaction to close sometime during Q2 of FY '24. The exact date of the close will drive where we land on the time-based range. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our first quarter guidance. For Q1, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $9 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $5.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $474 million to $534 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $423 million to $483 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.80. This includes a benefit of approximately $0.25 associated with accounting impacts of assets held for sale. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.42. Net interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be $73 million. Moving on to full year guidance, beginning on the next slide. For FY '24, we expect revenue at an enterprise level to be in the range of $33 billion to $34 billion. As I mentioned a moment ago, we anticipate closing the transaction during Q2 of our fiscal year. Therefore, our FY '24 guidance range reflects a range of potential outcomes. I would caution against reverting to the midpoint of these ranges as they are time-based ranges and will be highly dependent on actual transaction close date. Importantly, for FY '24, we expect core operating margins to improve by 30 basis points to 50 basis points year-on-year, mainly driven by our improved mix of business. Our investments in IT and factory automation will also drive improved optimization across our footprint and are anticipated to lead to higher margins in the future. Moving to our thoughts around CapEx for FY '24. In the coming year, we expect net capital expenditures to be in the range of 2.2% to 2.5% of net revenue. This is higher than the 2% in FY '23 due mainly to timing of CapEx investments rolling into the first quarter of FY '24. Upon closing the Mobility transaction, longer term, we now anticipate our CapEx to be lower as a percentage of revenue in the range of 2% to 2.3%. Our CapEx investments this year are expected to include a combination of maintenance and strategic investments for future growth and efficiency gains. We plan to continue to invest in targeted areas of our business with the bulk of our strategic growth CapEx aimed at the automotive EV space along with healthcare and renewable energy end markets. Moving on to cash flow generation. We closed out FY '23 with strong free cash flows north of $1 billion. We expect to continue generating strong cash flows in FY '24 with adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion. With that, let's now turn to our capital structure on the next slide. We have a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities, appropriately staggered at an attractive interest rates. We ended FY '23 with committed capacity under our global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity and our year-end cash balance, we had access to more than $5.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe affords us ample flexibility. We also remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. In fiscal '24 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, along with expected net proceeds from the Mobility business sale, I believe it's an appropriate time to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level how we plan to deploy our capital over the next two years. Please turn to the next slide. This morning, included in our earnings filing, we announced that our Board of Directors expanded our current share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion. We expect to begin executing on this upsized authorization immediately. You heard Adam say that we were unable to complete our Q4 share repurchases due to restrictions around the Mobility transaction. We plan to launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction in October prior to the close of our Mobility transaction. Post-closing of the Mobility transaction, we intend to execute a series of additional accelerated buybacks throughout FY '24 and FY '25 with the intent of optimizing share repurchases and interest expense, thereby maximizing the EPS impact. Moving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital. We believe this capital allocation framework will allow us to continue to grow our business and create value for shareholders. As a reminder, we have already reduced our outstanding shares from 203 million in 2013 to 131 million at the end of FY '23, a 35% reduction over this time period. Over the past 10 years, we've brought back our shares at an average price of $32.71 a share. Next, let's look at our FY '24 guidance. For FY '24, we expect the momentum underway across our business to continue, even in a subdued economic environment. Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments being made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 30 to 50 basis points of core margin expansion in FY '24 along with core EPS in the range of $9.30 to $9.70 and more than $1 billion in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approaches the line and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. As we transition to our final slide, I thought it made sense to provide you with a view of FY '25 excluding our Mobility business, but including the impact of our accelerated share repurchases post-closing. We believe we're on the path to deliver core operating margins at or above 5.6% in FY '25 and deliver more than $10.65 in core EPS. To deliver this, we need to only grow our revenues by a conservative 3% while continuing to execute a series of accelerated share repurchases. In my view, Jabil is well positioned to navigate the current economic environment, evidenced by our performance over the past several years. We are not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets that are undergoing multi-year secular growth, all of which gives me confidence as we march towards 6% core operating margins in the future. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. As we talked about at the outset of the call, there's a lot to be excited about here at Jabil. And we've given you a forecast for fiscal '24, which we believe will be a bit transitional, and fiscal '25, which we believe will be a bit more normalized and will include the full impact of the share repurchases from both our previous program as well as the portion from the Mobility deal. There's a lot to be excited about here at Jabil, and we're ready to get into your Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results and the very strong guidance. In fact, your margin guidance is significantly higher than we had expected. You're guiding for 60 basis points of improvement over two years and you've also talked about 6% operating margin. So, can you help us dive a little bit into that? I mean, how much of this margin improvement is coming from mixed shift within the portfolio? How much would you say is like-for-like pricing improvement? I mean, I would think that, by fiscal '25, you would have some recovery in Semi-Cap, maybe there is less inflation passed through and maybe you are taking some cost actions. So, any color you can give in terms of what are the different drivers for such a strong margin improvement?\nKenny Wilson: Hey, Ruplu. Good morning, and thank you for the question. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're really intentional. We just came out of our annual review of our strategic planning, and I think you'll see in Mike's comments also that we're viewing post the Mobility divestiture that 70% directly of our business is going to be in the EVs, AI clouds, renewables and healthcare. So, if you look at that, that's all areas of our business that we believe are accretive from a margin perspective. And then, if you just roll forward what we expect our growth to be in those areas, it really is a big chunk of that. Also, obviously, as you'd expect as the Mobility business moves out of the company, we're looking at right-sizing our footprint and just aligning with the new normal for our business. So it really is part of what we've been planning to do. We've been very intentional on it. And then, it really is just a function of as business with higher margin, grows and becomes a bigger part of our portfolio, that's where we see we get to from a margin perspective. It's not a function of us going back and trying to renegotiate higher prices with our customers. It really is a function of us adding more value in key end markets, and that's where we end up. So, we -- my other comment here would be, as you know, we are generally quite conservative. So, we wouldn't be talking to you about that if we didn't think there was a high degree of likelihood that we would achieve that.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks for all the details there, Kenny. If I can ask you on automotive, I mean, you've had very strong growth over the last couple of years. I mean, this past year, you grew 40%-plus, and now you're guiding another year of 20%-plus. I mean, the business now is sizable, right? It's like $4.5 billion. So, I mean, do you think that this level of growth can sustain? And what drives that? Is it -- are you increasing the content per vehicle, or is it that you're going to more OEMs than before? Just if you can just expand on how you're thinking about what drives that growth? And are you concerned about the competition in this space as more companies look to try and gain share in different aspects of automotive?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah, let me talk to that also. So, I think I said previously that the automotive business is hard and that being hard is good for us, and also you need to have a global footprint with consistent standard processes and capabilities and be able to launch products simultaneously in different geographies at the same time. There's not that many companies that can do that. And so that certainly helps us. We've been on a journey in the automotive space for quite some time. Chad Morley and his team have been driving that. We identified pretty early that electrification was going to be a huge trend and so we doubled down on that. And, obviously, as you listened to Fred talking about ACES, we're looking at software-defined also now. So, we've been thoughtfully focused on adding more of the key logos to our portfolio. And what we see is, as we add more logos or more companies that were involved in more and more programs -- and I think Mike has talked previously about how the business is like seven-year lifecycles, you've introduced them at different rates. So, what we see is going forward that the products that we're incubating now are going to be revenue and margin accretive in the next two or three, four, five years. So, we're feeling quite confident about our growth. Certainly, 20%, we think is probably reasonable. From a competition perspective, we compete globally with really, really good companies. Competition makes us better. So, we are well aware and we're pretty paranoid about our capability and our competitors. So, I would say that we don't have any real surprises with our competitors in terms of their capability relative to ours. And we're pretty confident that what we could offer being a U.S. domicile but with wonderful capabilities in Asia, Europe, and North America, we think that that model is a winner for our customers and for Jabil. So, we're feeling quite confident about our automotive growth in the short, medium, and long term.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thanks for all the details. I'm going to try and sneak one more quick one in. I mean, you're guiding for strong growth in new areas that I haven't heard of before, like the energy storage side is now much stronger for you and the data center side. So, do you think you have enough footprint to support this growth over the next few years? And when I look at your CapEx guidance, it's still in that normal range of 2.2% to 2.5%. So, I mean, do you think that is enough CapEx to support this new growth? So, just your thoughts on the footprint and CapEx and areas of investment? Thank you so much again. Congrats on the quarter and the day.\nFred McCoy: Hey, Ruplu, this is Fred McCoy. I'll take that for you. Yeah, we've announced some expansions in previous calls. We've expanded our footprint both in North America and Europe. So, we feel really confident and comfortable in supporting the regional needs for those markets that you cite. We've seen some movement, as I mentioned, with some of the legislation in Europe and the U.S. driving specific regional requirements, and we think we're well positioned to support those energy storage and energy conversion programs in those regions. And all that's within our CapEx that we guided in the call. That's just part of our normal course of business in adjusting our capacity to meet customer needs.\nMike Dastoor: And, Ruplu, if I can just add, if you look at our CapEx, historically, a few years ago, it was in the range of 3.5%. Over the years, we've taken it down to -- we've always suggested 2.5%, 2.6% range. We will have the Mobility transaction going through. We are working on taking this CapEx number down quite a bit. I think the normalized range, if you look at what happened in FY '23 is our CapEx went down to 2%, but that was a little bit of a timing difference. So, FY '24, we expect CapEx to still be in the 2.3% to 2.5% range, but going forward, the 2% to 2.2% to 2.3% sounds highly doable. If you look at what we've done over the last few years, we've grown from $17 billion to $35 billion. So, we've doubled our revenues, and we've always managed our CapEx through that doubling phase. It'll be the same with automotive. It'll be the same with all the other high-margin secular growth and markets. We will continue to manage CapEx with a lot of discipline. And I think the number has already reflected, all expansion is reflected when we give out CapEx percentages.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good morning. A couple questions from me. First of all, I was wondering if you could dig in a little more into the cloud slide that you presented from the aspect of the growth. Mike, you mentioned 20% sort of like-for-like growth on the rack configurations, but it seems like the drivers are a couple of different areas. Like, can you explain what you meant by customer diversity? And then also, how investing in new technologies like liquid cooling is driving some of the growth? And along those lines, I noticed you mentioned OSAT packaging, which I think is new. Can you just sort of give us an explanation on that bullet point? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nKenny Wilson: Hi, Steve, good morning. Yeah, so we were talking about that just this morning actually, and I think it's worth just reaffirming you on the cloud space. We really think the model we have is outstanding. So, it's asset-like, it's co-located with our customer. We also think that as our customers look to disaggregate a lot of the other parts of the data center that it plays to our strength, and I'll get to the optics in OSAT in a second. So, what we find is that relationship drives effectively us sitting at the same side of the table, trying to solution how can we do things efficiently and how can we help them grow, because we view there's going to be significant growth, especially underpinned by AI. So, what we see is we've got to -- if you take our existing cloud business and what we see, that's been augmented by a real pivot to AI. From a consignment perspective, if you look at the GPUs, as Mike mentioned, that's going to be a pass through for us because we don't add any value there. But what you find in cloud is that really just the model we have is allowing us to really go deep with our customers and grow our business there. In terms of you mentioned about OSAT, let me talk about that. As we discuss with our customers, and Fred mentioned in liquid cooling, the power requirements for what we're doing in data centers has become significant. Air cooling no longer works, so they're looking for a liquid-cooled capability. You need to use photonics extensively, again, because of the power requirements. So, sitting with our customers means that they ask us, \"Can you help us in liquid cooling? Can you help us in photonics? Can you help us in pluggable transceivers, et cetera, et cetera?\" So that helps us as we go into strategic planning to look at where should we be investing our dollars and capabilities to help our customers. The good thing for us, Steve, is that as we go more vertical and end markets, it simplifies our customers' lives and it makes our solutions more robust and it effectively allows us to grow our business there. So that's kind of how we see things in the cloud. And hopefully that answers your question.\nSteven Fox: Yeah, no, that's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Mike, it sounds like what you're saying with the fiscal '25 guidance is to assume that you sort of execute on $2.5 billion of buybacks by then. And if that's the case, is there any way to sort of give us an idea of how much we should assume in buybacks, or how the share count conservatively comes down this year? I know there's a lot of timing issues there, but it seems like that's an important part of the EPS model to understand now for a little while.\nMike Dastoor: Absolutely, Steve. I think you're absolutely right. The buyback scenario is dependent on the timing of the close. But regardless, let me just -- I think this morning you saw the Board expanded our authorization -- current authorization, $2.5 billion. I think, if you remember, Adam mentioned in his prepared remarks that, in Q4, we were unable to complete our Q4 share buybacks due to the restrictions that are associated with the Mobility transaction. So, in October, like starting next week, we will therefore, we will be executing an accelerated share repurchase program of $500 million, regardless of the timing of the close. So, think of that as almost like a catch-up and taking advantage of current market situation as well. Post-close, we will execute a series. Obviously, it will depend when in Q2 it closes, but we will execute a series of accelerated share repurchases. We'll start as soon as the Mobility transaction closes and we've received all the cash. We probably won't do a full accelerated share buyback on day one itself for the entire amount. We're going to do a series of buybacks. And the reason for that is we're trying to balance the impact of interest costs along with the benefit of the WASO, like you suggested, on the calculations we've run as a balanced approach actually maximizes EPS. So that's what we're going to do, which means, by the end of FY '24, we still won't be completed fully with our buybacks. I think out of the $2.5 billion, I expect about $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion to be completed by FY '24, and in FY '25, we'll complete the balance of that transaction. I think from a WASO perspective, I'm looking at end of '24 and the range of that 126 million, 128 million shares, while in '24, again, depending on how we manage it through FY '25, it'll be in the 115 million, 118 million range.\nSteven Fox: Great, that's helpful. And one just quick question on all that. Should an acquisition come up, would that possibly change the goals you just laid out, or could you do M&A and still do this amount of buybacks? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: No. So, I think the company, the management team, everyone feels we're highly undervalued still, and the best return that we can get is in buybacks. Having said that, if an M&A comes up -- I'll just remind you our debt leverage is at a very low point. It's at like 1.1, and that gives us sufficient room to do an acquisition if needed from debt if the financials work out and it's capability driven, it's all in the right end markets, et cetera. So, it'll be based on -- it'll be based off of our debt structure. So, I would think of the buybacks as -- we're definitely going to go and do that, and any M&A will be on top of that, and we have plenty of liquidity and plenty of leverage to do that.\nSteven Fox: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thanks, and good morning, everyone. A couple of questions for me if I can. One on in terms of your guidance for EMS, it looks like you're guiding Networking and Storage down 6% and you also talked about,, Kenny, the fact that you're disciplined, you starting to optimize your customer portfolio there. So, does that guidance reflect just weakness in end markets in terms of visibility with customers, or are you disengaging with some programs that don't meet your return or profitability goals?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah, hey, [Steven] (ph), it's a little bit of both in this instance.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Maybe drill down a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in those markets?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah, I mean just that, there are kind of some legacy EMS type kind of built to print type of models in some instances. And our view there is that where we can serve -- we're always looking to find where we can serve and add value. If our serve and add value becomes 100% built to print, then probably there's people that can do that cheaper than us and can do it -- and allowing us to add value for other customers where we can be vertical or where we can do -- just do more engineering services or whatever. So, I mean, we're not walking away from customers. It's a discussion around, look, I'm not sure it's the right fit for ourselves and for our customers. So there's a little bit of that. And then some of it is just end market softness right now. We see some softness in that market as well as in the consumer space. So, we do expect that to recover. I mean, we're not walking away from the Networking and Storage business, just to be clear. We also see that in that area of our business that the amount of enhanced or advanced networking that's required to support the AI data centers is significant also. So, we think, longer term, this business will be okay for us, but we're just seeing a little bit of softness in the short term, plus, some discussions with a couple of customers.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thanks for that. And then, my next question, just regarding the inventory picture, supply chain challenges that you've had, and how we should think about how that flows through the model in the next year. You had a nice inventory reduction quarter-on-quarter. That net number is down. So, are you expecting that to reduce further? And are you seeing any other supply chain issues that you've called out in previous quarters, particularly in auto and medical in terms of legacy parts?\nMike Dastoor: Let me try and take that, Matt. The inventory days did come down by four days. I think the team did an excellent job. If you look at our supply chain team, our ops team, our BD teams, finance teams, all of them have done a fantastic job in getting that particular metric down. I think the focus that we put on that from a free cash flow perspective, from a working capital perspective, is all paying off. Having said that now, I don't expect it to go down into the low 50s. I think that 55 to 60, I think on previous calls I mentioned that's the range I was expecting mid to long term. It came sooner than expected, which is always a pleasant surprise. But I would expect that 55 to 60 day sort of range to be maintained. It might differ by nuances in particular quarters. It might go up a little bit, it might go down a little bit, but over the long term, I expect 55 to 60 days to be maintained. From a supply chain perspective, yes, supply chain constraints are coming down. However, I think, like you mentioned, the automotive and healthcare pieces, there still are some shortages going on there. Maybe not the same level that they were at three to six months ago, but we're still seeing some issues in those end markets all because of the legacy chips like you said as well. So, something we're watching, and when that starts coming down and normalizing, yeah, we'll get to the 55-ish range over a long period as well.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thank you. And just lastly, on the interest expense line, which was -- which you're guiding $73 million. What should we think about the full year, particularly with your excess cash in terms of bringing down your short-term borrowings? Is there a number that we should model for the year?\nMike Dastoor: Yeah, the excess cash has been built into our forecast. I think the number I'd say of FY '24 would be in the range of $290 million to $300 million. Again, we're being conservative there. If interest rates continue to go up, we don't have a crystal ball around that. But it's mainly our variable rate, which is higher right now because of everything that's going on in the markets. So, conservatively, I'd model $290 million to $300 million, Matt.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. All right, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning, and thank you very much for taking my questions. First on Mobility, by exiting that business, do you think you can allow Jabil to better pursue some of these other end markets? And maybe give us a little bit more details as you think about things like management time, perhaps feeling less constrained by customer diversification considerations or having more capital to invest?\nKenny Wilson: Hey, thanks for the question. So, Mark, yeah, so firstly, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the Mobility and the Mobility team. And I'd just like to call out again our gratitude as an organization for the work that they've done, which has been outstanding. I also think it would be a remiss of me not to call -- we're right in the middle of the transition right now and the collaboration between our team and the BYD team is absolutely outstanding. So, we're really pleased about how that's going. Yeah, in terms of the business, for sure, what we've been looking at here is -- and the way we try and focus our growth is, where can we add most value for our customer, and look at the world through the eyes of our customer. And that's why you'll see when we look at the end markets that we're focused on, we think it's end markets where the range of capabilities that we have in our company and the global presence that we have can really help our customers grow and develop. So, yeah, we'll be focusing much more on automotive, healthcare, just the renewables that we've mentioned previously, so for sure -- and AI and cloud, for sure that's going to give us the opportunity to do that. From a use of capital perspective, it helps us here also. So yeah, certainly from a management bandwidth, it's going to free up some of our time to go double down in these strong secular growth areas.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thanks for that, Kenny. Speaking of AI, you spoke about some of the nice growth you're seeing and opportunities. Could you clarify how much of your cloud and 5G business is tied to AI at this stage? And how do you see that progressing in your '24 and '25 outlook?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah, so at '24, it's roughly 20% to 25%, and we think that that's going to grow in the longer term and going to become a much bigger part of our cloud business.\nMark Delaney: That's very helpful. And just a clarification on the data center business. I think this is the third year you're seeing this transition to the consignment model, which has the revenue impact but helps the profit margin. With the shift you're expecting this year away from some of the consignment, do you think you're fully done now and is it the last year of that transition, or could this continue beyond fiscal '24? Thanks.\nKenny Wilson: I think it's going to be really dependent on the mix of the businesses. So, we are expanding the space there to allow us to do more cloud. Mike mentioned that we're up 20% year-over-year. And we don't see any slowdown in terms of the cloud rollout. So, I think it depends, but certainly for sure, we think that our volumes are going to grow, but it will grow in the AI space. So, probably our revenues would probably be relatively consistent at that level, I would think, in the next year or two.\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Mark, I feel the consignment levels that we are at today will be consistent going forward. I think we've done -- we've doubled our consignment. So, even though volumes are up by 20%, we've actually doubled our consignment levels over this period. And that's impacting our total revenue number. But this is all good news, right? So, I don't think this is something that is negative. It's actually a big positive for us because it helps with our balance sheet, it helps with our margins, it helps flow through, it helps the customer, it helps Jabil, it's a win-win for everyone. But now that we've doubled our consignment levels, there might be another 5%, 10% that might come through, but I think we're at a decent stage currently with the indicators we provided.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my questions. And I appreciate all the detail. It's incredibly helpful. I have a couple of questions, and maybe one for Kenny and a couple for Mike. So, Kenny, just on the Mobility transaction, I know you're probably limited in terms of what you can say. But what gives you confidence? We're just trying to think through, what gives you confidence that this deal could close, let's say, within two quarters? Because I'm sure you're aware there's other deals that have been pending earlier in the year that are taking upwards of 12 months, if not longer. So, kind of what's going on there and kind of what are the steps that we should be looking at following sort of the purchase agreement data that you published last night? And then, I'll just hold off and ask Mike my follow-ups, if that's okay.\nKenny Wilson: Yeah, thanks for the question, David. So, yeah, we are really, really deep in this right now. I mentioned previously about the -- how effectively we're working together with BYDE. And that is really, really pleasing, especially for people that are going to go work in that organization and the leadership team is outstanding. Yeah, we've -- it's really detailed. We've spoken to all of the stakeholders. We think we've got a really good plan, detailed plan, and we're very, very confident that we'll close this in the timeline that we covered in our prepared remarks. We're actually focused on trying to close it as soon as possible, obviously. If we could do that in this calendar year, it would be wonderful. But yeah, with BYD's support in Asia and our support in North America, we think that we're very confident that it's going to be closed in the timeline that we mentioned.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And then maybe for Mike, I appreciate the color on the margins and the mix shift embedded in sort of the outlook for fiscal '24. But can you kind of touch on 1Q to start? It looks like at the high end, operating margins are closing in on 6%. And I would imagine that includes Mobility for at least the full quarter, to Kenny's point. And -- but when we look at the full year of '24, I would imagine the base case in the projections are Mobility exiting the business by the end of, let's say, fiscal 2Q and margins kind of trend lower in, I would imagine, 2Q and the back half of the year. So kind of what's going on in the first quarter? I know mix, you mentioned earlier, it's a faster growing business. This helps margins in the full year, but specifically in 1Q, why are margins so strong and what does that imply for Mobility margins? And then, maybe just as a quick follow up, I'll give them to you both at the same time, I think you made a comment that your fiscal '25 outlook only contemplates growth of about 3%. I would assume that's based off of a '24 number that is pro forma excluding Mobility. Is that maybe the right way to think about it? And I'll just stop there.\nMike Dastoor: David, let me answer your second question first. The answer is, yes, it excludes Mobility. So, when we're looking forward to FY '25, the 3% growth is on the non-Mobility piece. As it relates to Q1 margin, there's a couple of dynamics going on. We talked about consignment in the cloud, that has a little bit of an impact for margins in Q1 and for all of FY '24 as well. Our mix continues to shift into the higher mix end markets, the higher margin end markets. There is a shift taking place there, which is working for us. I think I highlighted, and Kenny talked about it as well, 70% of our non-Mobility business now is going to be in those four end markets. There's no major change in the Mobility piece other than some -- I think I called out a couple of pieces, I called out the consignment piece and I called out some shift of work content which is more bill of material driven rather than anything else. There's no manufacturing change at all and the value add that we provide is still the same, but it was just a bill of material moving upstream rather than through us. So that has a little bit of a positive impact on margin. And then last but not least, we did -- we signed a preliminary agreement on 27th of August. On the 27th of August, we triggered an asset held for sale sort of accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. In Q4, there wasn't much of an impact at all. There was zero impact on the P&L. There was some tax that we had to provide for -- under GAAP for Q4. But in Q1, there is about a $40 million, $50 million pickup because we're pulling out depreciation as part of this accounting treatment for assets held for sale. I called it out in my prepared remarks, I mentioned there's about a $0.25 improvement because of this, but don't forget, through the year, this sort of improvement gets offset by stranded costs that will take time to pull out towards the end of the year. But in Q1, there's quite a few dynamics moving around whereby our revenue looks lower, but it's not because it's mainly bill of material driven and there's some other dynamics as well.\nDavid Vogt: Mike, just to clarify, so is the stranded cost and this sort of triggered gain embedded in the core non-GAAP projections, or is that just strictly in the GAAP numbers for '24?\nMike Dastoor: No, the asset held for sale, the depreciation is embedded in our core. I think I mentioned that specifically when I was talking about the core EPS, there was a $0.25 impact. The stranded costs are also included in core. We've got stranded costs towards the end of the year. We'll only be able to get to restructure those in maybe Q3 or Q4 well after the transaction closes.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. Thanks again for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter and the strong guide. Yeah, just a couple of quick questions. Firstly, can you kind of talk about share gains? Just maybe pass out kind of what are you seeing in terms of the continued share gains, whether that's mostly from new markets or existing growth markets you guys already in right now?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. Hey, George, nice to talk to you. Yeah, so what we're seeing is, I think we're seeing some offset in markets right now. So, if you look at the consumer, for example, we call that Network and Storage, that's down. So, we're not losing market share there. But in the markets that we're focused on, like in automotive and healthcare, renewables, for sure, we're gaining share in those areas. So that is allowing us to offset some softness in consumer, for example, and still be able to grow -- normally grow our business. So you see, we are seeing sheer gains in those targeted areas.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. And also, I kind of want to double-click on the opportunities out of China, especially given the reshoring trends and maybe kind of specifically in Eastern Europe, kind of on the EV production side and also Mexico. Would you like to call out a few other regions kind of outside of China, also in particular vertical, like that could drive incremental growth as this reshoring trend continues?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah, okay. So, let me just -- if this doesn't satisfy your question, just let me know, George. But -- so, we have a phenomenal capability and a really robust footprint in China. We leverage a lot of capabilities across the company from our footprint there. What we do see is that we see opportunities in China for China. We think that whether it's in EVs or multiple different end markets, we think our facilities are full and we're adding more demand in our China facilities. So, when we talk about regionalization, we're not -- it's not cannibalizing our footprint in China. And we think that the demand is going to increase for us there in the longer term, which is great because the teams and the people we have in China are absolutely outstanding. But to answer your other question, yeah, we see -- look at reshoring in Europe and North America, it's a big part of what we're doing and what you see growth in our targeted end markets. The good thing about our company and our capability is that we have standard processes. We have a consistent culture, of course nuanced in different parts of the world. We have a standard unified ERP system. So, what it means is, it means our ability to take capabilities and products and move them around the world and build them in the same -- different geographies at the same time. I would argue that we're among the best in the world at that. So, we see -- our focus is on China to support China market and also for export, but also we see leveraging those capabilities in different parts of the world is something that's going to help us grow in the longer term. So, I guess, in summary, the regionalization, as we call it, or reshoring, is -- that's a net positive for us. So, we're feeling pretty confident about that in the future.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Thank you. Congrats again. I will go back to the queue.\nKenny Wilson: You're Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey, thanks for the question, guys. This is Joe Cardoso on for Sameek Chatterjee. Just one question for me, but maybe a two-parter. Your outlook for Industrial and Semi-Cap encompasses more muted forecasts for your Semi-Cap business for '24. Within that, can you just bifurcate between what you're seeing in the front-end and back-end of the business and how you see those tracking through the year? And then, you talked about prepping or investing into that business for '25. Can you just dive into that a bit and touch on if there's any specific areas you're investing in, or is that more of just a broader comment relative of being prepared for that end market as it recovers? Thank you.\nFred McCoy: Hi, this is Fred. I'll try to take that question for you. So, right now, we're seeing a lot of uncertainty in our fiscal '24. I think the industry is looking at kind of the back half of calendar '24 for a rebound. So that's how we've modeled the Semi-Cap business for our FY '24. I think that's both front-end and back-end. We're seeing those challenges. In terms of the investment, I mean, we're well aware of the CHIPS Act and the other investment acts in Europe, and we are also well positioned in some of the regional trends that are going on, both on the manufacturing and the components that go into the semi-capital equipment. So, we're really using this period to kind of optimize our footprint, optimize our capability and our capacity in the right regions to support what we see as where the bounce back will happen when it does late in 2024 or early 2025. So, we feel really comfortable that -- again, as Kenny alluded to on the prior question, our global footprint and our standard practices will allow us to be the key supplier to this market in all three regions of the world.\nJoe Cardoso: Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you. Our call has now ended. If you have any further questions, please reach out. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fred McCoy",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny. Good morning, everyone. As you've heard from Adam and Kenny, there's a lot going on at Jabil at the moment and quite a lot to be excited about. It's my privilege to join the call today and, over the next few minutes, to walk you through the demand dynamics inside our diversified markets and how we see each shaping up for the coming year. As we move into FY '24, we continue to expect growth in our business to be headlined by end markets that are benefiting from strong multi-year tailwinds, specifically renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, AI cloud data centers, and healthcare. Let's begin with what's going on in our Industrial and Semi-Cap end market on the next slide. In Industrial, we're experiencing robust growth in clean and smart energy infrastructure, as governments globally implement legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States to increase investment in new projects. As a reminder, we play across the entire energy value chain from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage, and metering, and to the management of power inside homes and buildings. These projects have multi-year investment timelines, independent of underlying short-term economic growth forecasts. So, we feel comfortable with the visibility we have in this space given these elongated infrastructure build-outs. As an example, a relatively new market that we're particularly excited about is the energy storage systems market, from grid level to inside the home and in support of rapid EV charging. On the back of several recent wins in the U.S. and Europe, we expect this space to drive solid growth in the coming years, leveraging our investments in battery module integration. We are well positioned to support growth in the renewable energy infrastructure space due to a unique combination of power engineering expertise, in-region manufacturing, and supply chain capabilities. As a result, we expect revenue for our industrial business to be up more than 20% in FY '24. Offsetting this growth slightly is our Semi-Cap business, as we anticipate market demand to remain muted for most of our fiscal year. As a reminder, our Semi-Cap business spans both front-end, with gear that turns wafer into chips, to the back-end with gear that inspects and tests the wafer or resulting chips. Our strategy in this end market has been very thoughtful due to the high cyclicality of the market, and we've been very focused around how we've invested in this business, expecting demand to remain muted in FY '24 while preparing the capabilities and regional footprint for us to be well positioned to grow when the market moves higher as end market demand rebounds. Within our Automotive and Transport business, we continue to expect growth to be driven by the global transition to electric vehicles. For FY '24, we expect another year of 20%-plus revenue growth, despite what is a choppy overall global demand environment. The global shift to EVs continues to accelerate, and we expect EVs to represent a larger share of the global auto market in FY '24, regardless of near-term global growth dynamics. In this space, we support an increasingly diverse set of the world's leading automotive OEMs as they launch new electric vehicle platforms across multiple geographies. Our focus areas in the EV market we refer to as ACES, or ADAS and autonomous, connectivity, electrification, and software-defined vehicle architecture. In the EV market, we support products such as compute and control modules, power conversion, battery management, optical camera modules, LiDAR, and other sensors, as well as charging solutions. The path to mass adoption of electric vehicles globally is exceedingly complex, and there are very few companies that are as well positioned as Jabil to support customers' multiple complex program ramps on multiple continents with industry-leading supply chain, design and manufacturing capabilities. Moving to cloud. Our cloud solutions continue to resonate with customers of all sizes, from large hyperscalers to Tier 2 cloud providers, such as technology companies and leading financial firms. Today, cloud represents a relatively small portion of overall global IT spend, but we expect secular growth in this area to accelerate, including the related data center infrastructure, especially with the proliferation of AI and ML. Next-generation clouds, and especially AI cloud data centers, present unique challenges to customers. AI workloads, which are powered by extremely powerful GPUs that consume significantly more energy and drive increased data generation. This creates three challenges: insufficient power supply on the grid to support expanded data center needs; heat generation that surpasses the capabilities of air-cooled data centers; and enhanced data interconnections between racks to support increased data inside the data center. Our design-to-dust capabilities continue to resonate with customers, and we are investing in the areas of data center infrastructure services, liquid cooling, and silicon photonics to help our customers solve the above challenges. Jabil is extremely well positioned to support customers as they incorporate innovative technologies into their data centers. And with the asset-light nature of the business, we have maximum flexibility to adapt and support customer needs around the world. We're already seeing success in this area. Jabil was recently awarded and began production of our largest cloud customers' artificial intelligence rack configurations that are GPU dense, which are consigned. Because these components are among those consigned, we will see year-over-year headwinds to revenue, especially in the first half of the year. In spite of the revenue decline, the underlying business and associated unit volumes, however, are expected to grow by more than 20% in FY '24. In Healthcare, we expect another robust growth year with revenue up 9% year-on-year. In the healthcare space, the range of products we design and manufacture lean into digital healthcare trends and include: highly complex diagnostic equipment and related consumables; orthopedics, including 3D printed implantables; precision health and medical devices, like minimally invasive devices; and pharma solutions, including smart injection delivery devices for diabetes and obesity drugs. Jabil's credibility in the healthcare space as the largest EMS provider in the space positions us well to take advantage of the outsourcing of manufacturing trends. In the coming years, we expect OEMs to continue to accelerate this outsourcing trend regardless of global macro growth. A recession-resistant end market with long product lifecycles and accretive margins and stable cash flows is why healthcare continues to be such a critical component of our diversified portfolio. Within Digital Print and Retail, we're seeing slower demand in legacy print and point of sale markets. This is being offset by growth in warehouse and retail automation markets, as we have a number of key wins that will be ramping in the back half of the fiscal year. These wins leverage unique capabilities in 3D printing of production components, robotics, engineering software and integration, and complex manufacturing automation. Our recent success shows we are well positioned in these end markets to help our customers bring next-generation automation technologies to market. Within our Networking and Storage end markets, we continue our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize margins and cash flows. We also expect overall market demand to be muted this year. Longer term, however, we anticipate growth coming from new programs in development for advanced optical networking, for high-performance data center interconnect that will support growth in cloud and AI data center applications. And finally within our Connected Devices business, demand remain soft, reflective of weakness in consumer goods spending. We expect another year of market... [Technical Difficulty] Hey, Ruplu, this is Fred McCoy. I'll take that for you. Yeah, we've announced some expansions in previous calls. We've expanded our footprint both in North America and Europe. So, we feel really confident and comfortable in supporting the regional needs for those markets that you cite. We've seen some movement, as I mentioned, with some of the legislation in Europe and the U.S. driving specific regional requirements, and we think we're well positioned to support those energy storage and energy conversion programs in those regions. And all that's within our CapEx that we guided in the call. That's just part of our normal course of business in adjusting our capacity to meet customer needs. Hi, this is Fred. I'll try to take that question for you. So, right now, we're seeing a lot of uncertainty in our fiscal '24. I think the industry is looking at kind of the back half of calendar '24 for a rebound. So that's how we've modeled the Semi-Cap business for our FY '24. I think that's both front-end and back-end. We're seeing those challenges. In terms of the investment, I mean, we're well aware of the CHIPS Act and the other investment acts in Europe, and we are also well positioned in some of the regional trends that are going on, both on the manufacturing and the components that go into the semi-capital equipment. So, we're really using this period to kind of optimize our footprint, optimize our capability and our capacity in the right regions to support what we see as where the bounce back will happen when it does late in 2024 or early 2025. So, we feel really comfortable that -- again, as Kenny alluded to on the prior question, our global footprint and our standard practices will allow us to be the key supplier to this market in all three regions of the world."

            "content": "[Technical Difficulty] ...and set of capabilities to deliver for our customers. With that, let's turn to the next slide. We heard Fred take us through each of our end markets and how we plan to optimize this portfolio even further. We continue to benefit from multiple long-term secular growth end markets, such as electric vehicles, healthcare, renewables, and AI-driven cloud data centers. In fact, for FY '24, we expect these four end markets to make up nearly 70% of our FY '24 revenue mix, excluding the revenue associated with the Mobility sale. Upon closing the Mobility transaction, we no longer anticipate having any customer that represents 10% or more of revenue. The long-term viability of these end markets continues to give me a high level of confidence as we navigate a range of economic scenarios while expanding margins and free cash flows. Next slide. FY '24 is a pivotal year in our journey. After considering a range of scenarios with differing outcomes associated with the timing of the Mobility transaction close, we thought it might be helpful to provide a time-based range for FY '24 results including our Mobility business until the transaction close date and highlight the FY '25 outlook excluding Mobility and after considering the full impact of accelerated share repurchases. But before I do that, I'd like to walk you through some assumptions we have used, most of which we have already discussed on this call. For FY '24, we assume economic conditions remain challenged for the consumer, which we have reflected in our consumer-related end market guidance. In the coming year, we continue to optimize our end market portfolio in Networking and Storage. As Fred mentioned earlier, we began production of our largest cloud customers' artificial intelligence rack configurations. These racks are GPU dense and are among the components that have transitioned to a customer control consignment service model, which has effectively doubled the consignment percentage from a year ago. While volumes are expected to grow by more than 20%, we expect the shift to result in lower revenue as compared to last year of approximately $500 million in Q1 and approximately $200 million in Q2. Within our Mobility business in Q1, we expect the change in work content associated with new products to impact year-over-year revenue growth by approximately $300 million to $400 million. And finally, we anticipate the Mobility transaction to close sometime during Q2 of FY '24. The exact date of the close will drive where we land on the time-based range. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our first quarter guidance. For Q1, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $9 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $5.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $474 million to $534 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $423 million to $483 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.80. This includes a benefit of approximately $0.25 associated with accounting impacts of assets held for sale. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.42. Net interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be $73 million. Moving on to full year guidance, beginning on the next slide. For FY '24, we expect revenue at an enterprise level to be in the range of $33 billion to $34 billion. As I mentioned a moment ago, we anticipate closing the transaction during Q2 of our fiscal year. Therefore, our FY '24 guidance range reflects a range of potential outcomes. I would caution against reverting to the midpoint of these ranges as they are time-based ranges and will be highly dependent on actual transaction close date. Importantly, for FY '24, we expect core operating margins to improve by 30 basis points to 50 basis points year-on-year, mainly driven by our improved mix of business. Our investments in IT and factory automation will also drive improved optimization across our footprint and are anticipated to lead to higher margins in the future. Moving to our thoughts around CapEx for FY '24. In the coming year, we expect net capital expenditures to be in the range of 2.2% to 2.5% of net revenue. This is higher than the 2% in FY '23 due mainly to timing of CapEx investments rolling into the first quarter of FY '24. Upon closing the Mobility transaction, longer term, we now anticipate our CapEx to be lower as a percentage of revenue in the range of 2% to 2.3%. Our CapEx investments this year are expected to include a combination of maintenance and strategic investments for future growth and efficiency gains. We plan to continue to invest in targeted areas of our business with the bulk of our strategic growth CapEx aimed at the automotive EV space along with healthcare and renewable energy end markets. Moving on to cash flow generation. We closed out FY '23 with strong free cash flows north of $1 billion. We expect to continue generating strong cash flows in FY '24 with adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion. With that, let's now turn to our capital structure on the next slide. We have a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities, appropriately staggered at an attractive interest rates. We ended FY '23 with committed capacity under our global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity and our year-end cash balance, we had access to more than $5.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe affords us ample flexibility. We also remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. In fiscal '24 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, along with expected net proceeds from the Mobility business sale, I believe it's an appropriate time to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level how we plan to deploy our capital over the next two years. Please turn to the next slide. This morning, included in our earnings filing, we announced that our Board of Directors expanded our current share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion. We expect to begin executing on this upsized authorization immediately. You heard Adam say that we were unable to complete our Q4 share repurchases due to restrictions around the Mobility transaction. We plan to launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction in October prior to the close of our Mobility transaction. Post-closing of the Mobility transaction, we intend to execute a series of additional accelerated buybacks throughout FY '24 and FY '25 with the intent of optimizing share repurchases and interest expense, thereby maximizing the EPS impact. Moving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital. We believe this capital allocation framework will allow us to continue to grow our business and create value for shareholders. As a reminder, we have already reduced our outstanding shares from 203 million in 2013 to 131 million at the end of FY '23, a 35% reduction over this time period. Over the past 10 years, we've brought back our shares at an average price of $32.71 a share. Next, let's look at our FY '24 guidance. For FY '24, we expect the momentum underway across our business to continue, even in a subdued economic environment. Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments being made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 30 to 50 basis points of core margin expansion in FY '24 along with core EPS in the range of $9.30 to $9.70 and more than $1 billion in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approaches the line and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders. As we transition to our final slide, I thought it made sense to provide you with a view of FY '25 excluding our Mobility business, but including the impact of our accelerated share repurchases post-closing. We believe we're on the path to deliver core operating margins at or above 5.6% in FY '25 and deliver more than $10.65 in core EPS. To deliver this, we need to only grow our revenues by a conservative 3% while continuing to execute a series of accelerated share repurchases. In my view, Jabil is well positioned to navigate the current economic environment, evidenced by our performance over the past several years. We are not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets that are undergoing multi-year secular growth, all of which gives me confidence as we march towards 6% core operating margins in the future. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Adam. And, Ruplu, if I can just add, if you look at our CapEx, historically, a few years ago, it was in the range of 3.5%. Over the years, we've taken it down to -- we've always suggested 2.5%, 2.6% range. We will have the Mobility transaction going through. We are working on taking this CapEx number down quite a bit. I think the normalized range, if you look at what happened in FY '23 is our CapEx went down to 2%, but that was a little bit of a timing difference. So, FY '24, we expect CapEx to still be in the 2.3% to 2.5% range, but going forward, the 2% to 2.2% to 2.3% sounds highly doable. If you look at what we've done over the last few years, we've grown from $17 billion to $35 billion. So, we've doubled our revenues, and we've always managed our CapEx through that doubling phase. It'll be the same with automotive. It'll be the same with all the other high-margin secular growth and markets. We will continue to manage CapEx with a lot of discipline. And I think the number has already reflected, all expansion is reflected when we give out CapEx percentages. Absolutely, Steve. I think you're absolutely right. The buyback scenario is dependent on the timing of the close. But regardless, let me just -- I think this morning you saw the Board expanded our authorization -- current authorization, $2.5 billion. I think, if you remember, Adam mentioned in his prepared remarks that, in Q4, we were unable to complete our Q4 share buybacks due to the restrictions that are associated with the Mobility transaction. So, in October, like starting next week, we will therefore, we will be executing an accelerated share repurchase program of $500 million, regardless of the timing of the close. So, think of that as almost like a catch-up and taking advantage of current market situation as well. Post-close, we will execute a series. Obviously, it will depend when in Q2 it closes, but we will execute a series of accelerated share repurchases. We'll start as soon as the Mobility transaction closes and we've received all the cash. We probably won't do a full accelerated share buyback on day one itself for the entire amount. We're going to do a series of buybacks. And the reason for that is we're trying to balance the impact of interest costs along with the benefit of the WASO, like you suggested, on the calculations we've run as a balanced approach actually maximizes EPS. So that's what we're going to do, which means, by the end of FY '24, we still won't be completed fully with our buybacks. I think out of the $2.5 billion, I expect about $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion to be completed by FY '24, and in FY '25, we'll complete the balance of that transaction. I think from a WASO perspective, I'm looking at end of '24 and the range of that 126 million, 128 million shares, while in '24, again, depending on how we manage it through FY '25, it'll be in the 115 million, 118 million range. No. So, I think the company, the management team, everyone feels we're highly undervalued still, and the best return that we can get is in buybacks. Having said that, if an M&A comes up -- I'll just remind you our debt leverage is at a very low point. It's at like 1.1, and that gives us sufficient room to do an acquisition if needed from debt if the financials work out and it's capability driven, it's all in the right end markets, et cetera. So, it'll be based on -- it'll be based off of our debt structure. So, I would think of the buybacks as -- we're definitely going to go and do that, and any M&A will be on top of that, and we have plenty of liquidity and plenty of leverage to do that. Let me try and take that, Matt. The inventory days did come down by four days. I think the team did an excellent job. If you look at our supply chain team, our ops team, our BD teams, finance teams, all of them have done a fantastic job in getting that particular metric down. I think the focus that we put on that from a free cash flow perspective, from a working capital perspective, is all paying off. Having said that now, I don't expect it to go down into the low 50s. I think that 55 to 60, I think on previous calls I mentioned that's the range I was expecting mid to long term. It came sooner than expected, which is always a pleasant surprise. But I would expect that 55 to 60 day sort of range to be maintained. It might differ by nuances in particular quarters. It might go up a little bit, it might go down a little bit, but over the long term, I expect 55 to 60 days to be maintained. From a supply chain perspective, yes, supply chain constraints are coming down. However, I think, like you mentioned, the automotive and healthcare pieces, there still are some shortages going on there. Maybe not the same level that they were at three to six months ago, but we're still seeing some issues in those end markets all because of the legacy chips like you said as well. So, something we're watching, and when that starts coming down and normalizing, yeah, we'll get to the 55-ish range over a long period as well. Yeah, the excess cash has been built into our forecast. I think the number I'd say of FY '24 would be in the range of $290 million to $300 million. Again, we're being conservative there. If interest rates continue to go up, we don't have a crystal ball around that. But it's mainly our variable rate, which is higher right now because of everything that's going on in the markets. So, conservatively, I'd model $290 million to $300 million, Matt. Hey, Mark, I feel the consignment levels that we are at today will be consistent going forward. I think we've done -- we've doubled our consignment. So, even though volumes are up by 20%, we've actually doubled our consignment levels over this period. And that's impacting our total revenue number. But this is all good news, right? So, I don't think this is something that is negative. It's actually a big positive for us because it helps with our balance sheet, it helps with our margins, it helps flow through, it helps the customer, it helps Jabil, it's a win-win for everyone. But now that we've doubled our consignment levels, there might be another 5%, 10% that might come through, but I think we're at a decent stage currently with the indicators we provided. David, let me answer your second question first. The answer is, yes, it excludes Mobility. So, when we're looking forward to FY '25, the 3% growth is on the non-Mobility piece. As it relates to Q1 margin, there's a couple of dynamics going on. We talked about consignment in the cloud, that has a little bit of an impact for margins in Q1 and for all of FY '24 as well. Our mix continues to shift into the higher mix end markets, the higher margin end markets. There is a shift taking place there, which is working for us. I think I highlighted, and Kenny talked about it as well, 70% of our non-Mobility business now is going to be in those four end markets. There's no major change in the Mobility piece other than some -- I think I called out a couple of pieces, I called out the consignment piece and I called out some shift of work content which is more bill of material driven rather than anything else. There's no manufacturing change at all and the value add that we provide is still the same, but it was just a bill of material moving upstream rather than through us. So that has a little bit of a positive impact on margin. And then last but not least, we did -- we signed a preliminary agreement on 27th of August. On the 27th of August, we triggered an asset held for sale sort of accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. In Q4, there wasn't much of an impact at all. There was zero impact on the P&L. There was some tax that we had to provide for -- under GAAP for Q4. But in Q1, there is about a $40 million, $50 million pickup because we're pulling out depreciation as part of this accounting treatment for assets held for sale. I called it out in my prepared remarks, I mentioned there's about a $0.25 improvement because of this, but don't forget, through the year, this sort of improvement gets offset by stranded costs that will take time to pull out towards the end of the year. But in Q1, there's quite a few dynamics moving around whereby our revenue looks lower, but it's not because it's mainly bill of material driven and there's some other dynamics as well. No, the asset held for sale, the depreciation is embedded in our core. I think I mentioned that specifically when I was talking about the core EPS, there was a $0.25 impact. The stranded costs are also included in core. We've got stranded costs towards the end of the year. We'll only be able to get to restructure those in maybe Q3 or Q4 well after the transaction closes."

            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As Adam highlighted, fiscal year '23 was another strong year, and I am pleased with the progress we've made relative to our financial objectives. Every day at Jabil, we strive to do the right thing. It is how we are wired. So, it's heartening when looking at our end-of-year report card to see that we are making progress on all fronts. Most satisfying for me is the resilience of our model, where despite end market choppiness, we posted very impressive year-on-year growth in core margins, up 40 basis points to 5%, earnings up 12%, and EPS up 13%, while also driving in excess of $1 billion in free cash flows. This time of year also sees us complete our annual strategic planning process. And it is reassuring to note that similar to last year, we reconfirmed our focus on investing in key areas of our business, including electric vehicles and autonomous driving, AI cloud solutions, renewable energy and healthcare. All of this sets a firm foundation for fiscal year '24 and beyond, and is a testament to our customer-centric model, which is both robust and adaptable to changes in end market. The next slide shows how these characteristics have shaped the last 10 years. And seen in this context, fiscal '23 was just another step in the journey. If I was looking for one word to summarize activities highlighted, it would be intentionality. We have and will continue to be very intentional as we look to grow and modify the mix of business to include longer lifecycle industries like healthcare with the acquisition of Nypro and our strategic collaboration with JJMD. In addition, we have also increased investment, both organically and inorganically, in emerging technologies. We view our capabilities as a match for important end markets, like renewable energy, infrastructure, electric vehicles, and cloud data centers. From an enterprise perspective, we began materially redirecting more and more of our free cash flows to buybacks and reinvest in ourselves at very attractive valuations. And finally, just a few weeks back, we unveiled yet another step on our journey as we announced the pending divestiture of our Mobility business to BYD Electronics for $2.2 billion. As we move into fiscal year '24 and beyond, you can continue to rely on this leadership team to allocate capital with a view to expanding shareholder value. I'd now like to spend a little time talking about our decision to sell the Mobility business. As you know, over the past five years, I've had the privilege both to lead and work alongside some of the most skilled and talented manufacturing engineers, operations leaders and material scientists in the world. And during that time, we were fortunate to build an incredible business while also delivering best-in-class products for one of the world's greatest brands. I had the front row seat, unlike any other, to truly appreciate and develop a deep understanding of the level of complexity involved in introducing and manufacturing precision mechanics at huge scale for our largest customer. This perspective provides me some credibility to make the claim that our Mobility team is second to none when it comes to innovative automation, tooling design, and manufacturing of these components at scale. And I also truly believe this talented organization can reach new heights when their capability is matched by a supportive business model focused on significant growth. To all my friends in the Mobility business, I will miss you deeply. Thanks for showing your company at its best, for never flinching from the sometimes seemingly unsurmountable asks, and doing so all with humility, professionalism, and great skill. It has been my honor to be a part of your team. Looking forward, I think your particular skill sets can be leveraged in endless ways. And while it's bittersweet to say goodbye to some great friends and colleagues, I know this is the best route for our customers, employees, and shareholders alike. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Fred to go deeper into our end markets, but before that, I wanted to reaffirm what you can expect from me as CEO. I will work tirelessly on your behalf to ensure that we are in the correct end markets and geographies with the correct capabilities to serve our customers. I will continue to ensure that our capital allocation is shareholder friendly, while appropriately funding our growth. And all of this will be underpinned by an unwavering passion and commitment to preserve, protect and grow our unique culture, which is the foundation of everything that is great about our company. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Fred. Hey, Ruplu. Good morning, and thank you for the question. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're really intentional. We just came out of our annual review of our strategic planning, and I think you'll see in Mike's comments also that we're viewing post the Mobility divestiture that 70% directly of our business is going to be in the EVs, AI clouds, renewables and healthcare. So, if you look at that, that's all areas of our business that we believe are accretive from a margin perspective. And then, if you just roll forward what we expect our growth to be in those areas, it really is a big chunk of that. Also, obviously, as you'd expect as the Mobility business moves out of the company, we're looking at right-sizing our footprint and just aligning with the new normal for our business. So it really is part of what we've been planning to do. We've been very intentional on it. And then, it really is just a function of as business with higher margin, grows and becomes a bigger part of our portfolio, that's where we see we get to from a margin perspective. It's not a function of us going back and trying to renegotiate higher prices with our customers. It really is a function of us adding more value in key end markets, and that's where we end up. So, we -- my other comment here would be, as you know, we are generally quite conservative. So, we wouldn't be talking to you about that if we didn't think there was a high degree of likelihood that we would achieve that. Yeah, let me talk to that also. So, I think I said previously that the automotive business is hard and that being hard is good for us, and also you need to have a global footprint with consistent standard processes and capabilities and be able to launch products simultaneously in different geographies at the same time. There's not that many companies that can do that. And so that certainly helps us. We've been on a journey in the automotive space for quite some time. Chad Morley and his team have been driving that. We identified pretty early that electrification was going to be a huge trend and so we doubled down on that. And, obviously, as you listened to Fred talking about ACES, we're looking at software-defined also now. So, we've been thoughtfully focused on adding more of the key logos to our portfolio. And what we see is, as we add more logos or more companies that were involved in more and more programs -- and I think Mike has talked previously about how the business is like seven-year lifecycles, you've introduced them at different rates. So, what we see is going forward that the products that we're incubating now are going to be revenue and margin accretive in the next two or three, four, five years. So, we're feeling quite confident about our growth. Certainly, 20%, we think is probably reasonable. From a competition perspective, we compete globally with really, really good companies. Competition makes us better. So, we are well aware and we're pretty paranoid about our capability and our competitors. So, I would say that we don't have any real surprises with our competitors in terms of their capability relative to ours. And we're pretty confident that what we could offer being a U.S. domicile but with wonderful capabilities in Asia, Europe, and North America, we think that that model is a winner for our customers and for Jabil. So, we're feeling quite confident about our automotive growth in the short, medium, and long term. Hi, Steve, good morning. Yeah, so we were talking about that just this morning actually, and I think it's worth just reaffirming you on the cloud space. We really think the model we have is outstanding. So, it's asset-like, it's co-located with our customer. We also think that as our customers look to disaggregate a lot of the other parts of the data center that it plays to our strength, and I'll get to the optics in OSAT in a second. So, what we find is that relationship drives effectively us sitting at the same side of the table, trying to solution how can we do things efficiently and how can we help them grow, because we view there's going to be significant growth, especially underpinned by AI. So, what we see is we've got to -- if you take our existing cloud business and what we see, that's been augmented by a real pivot to AI. From a consignment perspective, if you look at the GPUs, as Mike mentioned, that's going to be a pass through for us because we don't add any value there. But what you find in cloud is that really just the model we have is allowing us to really go deep with our customers and grow our business there. In terms of you mentioned about OSAT, let me talk about that. As we discuss with our customers, and Fred mentioned in liquid cooling, the power requirements for what we're doing in data centers has become significant. Air cooling no longer works, so they're looking for a liquid-cooled capability. You need to use photonics extensively, again, because of the power requirements. So, sitting with our customers means that they ask us, \"Can you help us in liquid cooling? Can you help us in photonics? Can you help us in pluggable transceivers, et cetera, et cetera?\" So that helps us as we go into strategic planning to look at where should we be investing our dollars and capabilities to help our customers. The good thing for us, Steve, is that as we go more vertical and end markets, it simplifies our customers' lives and it makes our solutions more robust and it effectively allows us to grow our business there. So that's kind of how we see things in the cloud. And hopefully that answers your question. Yeah, hey, [Steven] (ph), it's a little bit of both in this instance. Yeah, I mean just that, there are kind of some legacy EMS type kind of built to print type of models in some instances. And our view there is that where we can serve -- we're always looking to find where we can serve and add value. If our serve and add value becomes 100% built to print, then probably there's people that can do that cheaper than us and can do it -- and allowing us to add value for other customers where we can be vertical or where we can do -- just do more engineering services or whatever. So, I mean, we're not walking away from customers. It's a discussion around, look, I'm not sure it's the right fit for ourselves and for our customers. So there's a little bit of that. And then some of it is just end market softness right now. We see some softness in that market as well as in the consumer space. So, we do expect that to recover. I mean, we're not walking away from the Networking and Storage business, just to be clear. We also see that in that area of our business that the amount of enhanced or advanced networking that's required to support the AI data centers is significant also. So, we think, longer term, this business will be okay for us, but we're just seeing a little bit of softness in the short term, plus, some discussions with a couple of customers. Hey, thanks for the question. So, Mark, yeah, so firstly, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about the Mobility and the Mobility team. And I'd just like to call out again our gratitude as an organization for the work that they've done, which has been outstanding. I also think it would be a remiss of me not to call -- we're right in the middle of the transition right now and the collaboration between our team and the BYD team is absolutely outstanding. So, we're really pleased about how that's going. Yeah, in terms of the business, for sure, what we've been looking at here is -- and the way we try and focus our growth is, where can we add most value for our customer, and look at the world through the eyes of our customer. And that's why you'll see when we look at the end markets that we're focused on, we think it's end markets where the range of capabilities that we have in our company and the global presence that we have can really help our customers grow and develop. So, yeah, we'll be focusing much more on automotive, healthcare, just the renewables that we've mentioned previously, so for sure -- and AI and cloud, for sure that's going to give us the opportunity to do that. From a use of capital perspective, it helps us here also. So yeah, certainly from a management bandwidth, it's going to free up some of our time to go double down in these strong secular growth areas. Yeah, so at '24, it's roughly 20% to 25%, and we think that that's going to grow in the longer term and going to become a much bigger part of our cloud business. I think it's going to be really dependent on the mix of the businesses. So, we are expanding the space there to allow us to do more cloud. Mike mentioned that we're up 20% year-over-year. And we don't see any slowdown in terms of the cloud rollout. So, I think it depends, but certainly for sure, we think that our volumes are going to grow, but it will grow in the AI space. So, probably our revenues would probably be relatively consistent at that level, I would think, in the next year or two. Yeah, thanks for the question, David. So, yeah, we are really, really deep in this right now. I mentioned previously about the -- how effectively we're working together with BYDE. And that is really, really pleasing, especially for people that are going to go work in that organization and the leadership team is outstanding. Yeah, we've -- it's really detailed. We've spoken to all of the stakeholders. We think we've got a really good plan, detailed plan, and we're very, very confident that we'll close this in the timeline that we covered in our prepared remarks. We're actually focused on trying to close it as soon as possible, obviously. If we could do that in this calendar year, it would be wonderful. But yeah, with BYD's support in Asia and our support in North America, we think that we're very confident that it's going to be closed in the timeline that we mentioned. Yeah. Hey, George, nice to talk to you. Yeah, so what we're seeing is, I think we're seeing some offset in markets right now. So, if you look at the consumer, for example, we call that Network and Storage, that's down. So, we're not losing market share there. But in the markets that we're focused on, like in automotive and healthcare, renewables, for sure, we're gaining share in those areas. So that is allowing us to offset some softness in consumer, for example, and still be able to grow -- normally grow our business. So you see, we are seeing sheer gains in those targeted areas. Yeah, okay. So, let me just -- if this doesn't satisfy your question, just let me know, George. But -- so, we have a phenomenal capability and a really robust footprint in China. We leverage a lot of capabilities across the company from our footprint there. What we do see is that we see opportunities in China for China. We think that whether it's in EVs or multiple different end markets, we think our facilities are full and we're adding more demand in our China facilities. So, when we talk about regionalization, we're not -- it's not cannibalizing our footprint in China. And we think that the demand is going to increase for us there in the longer term, which is great because the teams and the people we have in China are absolutely outstanding. But to answer your other question, yeah, we see -- look at reshoring in Europe and North America, it's a big part of what we're doing and what you see growth in our targeted end markets. The good thing about our company and our capability is that we have standard processes. We have a consistent culture, of course nuanced in different parts of the world. We have a standard unified ERP system. So, what it means is, it means our ability to take capabilities and products and move them around the world and build them in the same -- different geographies at the same time. I would argue that we're among the best in the world at that. So, we see -- our focus is on China to support China market and also for export, but also we see leveraging those capabilities in different parts of the world is something that's going to help us grow in the longer term. So, I guess, in summary, the regionalization, as we call it, or reshoring, is -- that's a net positive for us. So, we're feeling pretty confident about that in the future. You're Welcome."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry. Please go ahead, Adam.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of our website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety will be posted there for audio playback. I'd now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statements. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fourth quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31st, 2022, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our third quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.5 billion in revenue at the top end of our guidance range. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $404 million or 4.8% of revenue. This is up 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net interest expense in the quarter came in better than expected at $75 million, reflecting lower levels of inventory during the quarter, resulting in better working capital management by the team. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $375 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.72. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.99, a 16% improvement over the prior-year quarter and towards the upper end of our guidance range. Now turning to the segments. Revenue for the DMS segment was $4.35 billion, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strength in our Automotive and Healthcare end markets. In particular, it's worth highlighting our Automotive business, which grew approximately 60% year-over-year as the team performed extremely well as volume, content, and brands continue to expand. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 4.1%, 30 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, but down 50 basis points sequentially as typical given the normal seasonal pattern within our Mobility business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Also as expected, we saw a revenue shift in our 5G Wireless and Cloud business, driven by our previously-announced move to a consignment model for certain components within that end market. It's also worth noting that our Industrial business driven by global demand for renewable energy increased by approximately 30% year-over-year. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment were an impressive 5.5%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially, reflecting strong growth in Industrial and the aforementioned shift to a consignment model. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q3, beginning with inventory, which saw a great improvement sequentially to 84 days. More importantly for us, net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 62 in Q3, an improvement of seven days sequentially. Our third quarter cash flows from operations came in at $468 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $212 million, resulting in $256 million in free cash flows during the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $154 million, leaving us with $821 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of May 31st. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of approximately $1.5 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2 times. In summary, the team delivered another impressive performance in Q3. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Mike and Kenny to provide some additional thoughts on our performance in the quarter and update our outlook for fiscal 2023. But before I hand it over, I'd like to announce our fourth quarter earnings call and 6th Annual Investor Briefing scheduled for September 28th, where we'll lay out our strategy and our financial plan for fiscal 2024. Please mark your calendars. Additionally, from an Investor Relations perspective, we're going to be active in fiscal 2024 with meetings, factory tours, and end market deep dives, where we plan to discuss and showcase some of the growth drivers that we feel support our longer-term expectations. Please stay tuned. And thanks for your time today. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Through the first nine months of fiscal year, the team has posted solid top-line growth, improved core operating income by more than twice the pace of revenue growth, and grew core EPS by 16%, while also expanding core operating margins by 30 basis points, a solid performance by the team. As you heard from Adam, our growth and improved profitability this year continues to be driven by areas of our business benefiting from secular growth like electric vehicles, healthcare, renewable energy infrastructure, and cloud. All-in-all, our solid performance year-to-date gives us excellent momentum as we enter the final quarter of FY 2023. With that, on the next slide, you'll see our fourth quarter guidance. For Q4, we expect total company revenues to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.8 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $424 million to $484 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $400 million to $460 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.50. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.32. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be $73 million which is lower than we forecasted in March, reflecting better working capital management by the team. Moving to the next slide where I'll offer an update on our end market demand assumptions and how these translate to our FY 2023 revenue expectations. At a high level, our assumptions remain largely consistent with our March update. We continue to be conservative in our approach given the current macroeconomic dynamics and expect strong growth from our secular markets to be slightly offset by lower demand in some of our consumer-facing markets and in Semi-Cap. In our Automotive end-market, EV growth continues to be robust, limited only by the pace at which we can scale up production across multiple geographies with several OEMs. In Healthcare, the outsourcing of manufacturing trend continues to play out as we are seeing increased activity with interest from multiple OEMs exploring our capabilities. Growth expectations for our Industrials business have also improved since March, driven higher by renewable energy infrastructure. Specifically, we're seeing good growth in solar inverters, smart meters, energy storage, and power and building management solutions. We now expect our Industrials business to be up more than 25% in FY 2023. This growth has been slightly offset by incremental end market weakness in our Semi-Cap business. In summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand across many of our end markets to remain strong. We now expect revenue for FY 2023 to be $34.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year which is $200 million, about what we thought in March. Considering this updated growth outlook, let's now turn to the next slide, to get a view of our updated guidance for FY 2023. Notably, we see income coming through with the increase to revenue. We now expect to deliver core operating income of $1.71 billion, a year-over-year increase of approximately 11%, while holding core margins at 4.9%. This 4.9% represents a growth of approximately 30 basis points year-on-year. With the additional income, we are now anticipating core EPS will be $8.50. We remain committed to generating more than $900 million in free cash flow this year. Beyond FY 2023, we expect our secular markets to continue to drive growth. I also believe our margins will continue to expand with the combination of our positive mix-shift towards higher-margin end-markets and operational efficiencies driven by automation and internal use of AI and ML technologies. In summary, the team is executing extremely well. I expect our strong momentum to continue into FY 2024, although we remain cautious and vigilant on the near-term macroeconomic conditions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kenny.\nKenny Wilson: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As you heard from Adam and Mike, our business is in good shape and the team has executed well this year in what continues to be a dynamic operating environment. The success we are seeing across our business is a key proof point of our teams' ability to leverage multiple capabilities across disparate end markets, as we continue to diversify our service offerings, underpinning our improving financial performance. Let's turn to the next slide where you'll see our updated outlook for fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect good year-over-year growth and operating leverage this year, which gives us the confidence to raise our expectations for core EPS by $0.10 to $8.50. At the same time, we remain highly focused on delivering more than $900 million in free cash flow. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin and free cash flow expansion as we look to fiscal year 2024. In fact, when I look at the growth in our business this year, it's worth highlighting that nearly 60% of our portfolio [indiscernible] the markets with strong secular growth, specifically, electric vehicles, renewable energy, healthcare, and 5G and cloud. Our Automotive business continues its healthy growth rate as the team navigates multiple complex program introductions, increasing both our scale and addressable content per vehicle. Jabil continues to be extremely well-positioned to support our customers as they accelerate their transition to EVs in the coming years. And in our Industrial business, we are supporting customers as they navigate the rapid transition towards clean energy. Over the last several years, we've invested heavily in capabilities to support energy storage, energy conversion, and grid-level power management solutions, which are now been deployed across multiple months at scale. Although we are in the early days of growth in this space, as government policies like the Inflation Reduction Act in the US mature and scale, Jabil is extremely well-positioned to support our customers in the coming years. In Healthcare, we continue to capitalize on the trend to outsource manufacturing, and our credibility with some of the leading OEMs in this space has positioned us well for future growth. Another area that is increasingly coming into focus for us is in the AI and ML space. This has implications both on the growth side of our business across multiple end markets, but also has the potential to drive efficiencies across our internal processes and factory network. As it relates to our internal processes, we are capturing data and using the latest toolkits to help improve our operations. [indiscernible] don't view this as a new initiative. We know the next step and a continuous improvement path we've been on for many years. Our operating system naturally drives us to simplify, standardize, optimize, and automate processes and this in conjunction with our enhanced ability to mine big data which ultimately drives sustainable improvements. In September, the Jabil team will go deeper in all of these areas at our Investor Briefing. At that event, we plan to offer our fiscal year 2024 financial outlook as we continue to prioritize growth in core margins and cash flows. Specifically, we will lay out how we plan to increase revenue, while also expanding core operating margins beyond 5%, and we plan to increase free cash flow by continuing to invest in growth. We provide another year of solid core EPS growth, and finally, provide an update on our capital return frameworks. In closing, I feel strongly that we have the right team, capabilities, and diversified portfolio to support strong momentum into the final quarter of fiscal year 2023 and beyond. And none of this would be possible without a thriving and unified Jabil culture which is as strong today as it has ever been. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Kenny. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Jabil has reported strong ROIC or return on invested capital over the past few years. It looks like over the past few quarters, it's been really strong. I mean, we calculate above 30% ROIC. This quarter was strong as well. Can you remind us what ROIC you target and what are the factors that will influence this going forward?\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Ruplu. Yes, the ROIC that we reported is in the 30% range. We normally target in that 25%, 30%. If you look at our working capital management, the way we use our invested capital, our CapEx, and all the factors that makeup invested capital, we're extremely disciplined on that. The returns are coming in. So, the numerator and denominator on the ROIC calculator or the ROIC calculation is actually quite robust and strong, and you can expect those levels of ROIC going forward as well, Ruplu.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: All right. Thanks for that, Mike. As a follow-up, maybe I can ask -- let me ask about the semiconductor capital equipment end market. I mean that end market right now is weak and your revenues are down year-on-year. However, when I think about it, that segment offers higher than corporate average margins. So, do you think you have enough capacity in that segment to take advantage of the market move upwards when that happens, and what things do keep in mind when deciding to invest more CapEx into that end market?\nKenny Wilson: Hey, Ruplu, it's Kenny, and good morning. Yes, it's a great question, and in fact just this morning, I was reading an article about the covered AI and it talked about the semiconductor space and just the wafer fabrication equipment and the demand and how that increases through 2024, 2025, and 2026, so I would say that we are -- our view is quite consistent with yours that we think that although it's a low right now, that's going to -- that's going to pick-up in the probably the second half of calendar 2024 and beyond. So, remember that we try and we diversify the all end markets and we're very well-diversified in this market also from a front-end to back-end perspective. We've been expanding our footprint across the world and anticipation of the pickup in demand through the back-end of next year, so we got a pretty competent team there that are ready and we're ready to build the demand for our customers when demand picks up through the back-end of next year. So we feel really, really good about where we are from a Semi-Cap perspective.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. And congrats on the strong execution in the quarter. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Yes, you're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you, and good morning. I wanted to dig a little deeper on some of the end market commentary, particularly on the consumer side. It looks like you actually took up your connected devices guidance a little bit for the year, but still down double-digits. Are you seeing any signs of consumer bottoming here or any outlook that gives you some confidence that you're going to get back to growth at some point?\nKenny Wilson: Yes, I think Mike mentioned it quite well in his prepared remarks about that we're cautious of the near-term macro. We're very, very well-diversified in the connected devices space and -- but sometimes you get pleasant surprises in the upside like we had in Q3, but we still think it's choppy and spotty and we think we're bumped along the bottom. I would also mention, Matt, that as we look at our business here, we did get a COVID pickup effectively and we're probably run at the run rates that we were in 2019, 2020, 2021, that kind of level. That said, we have won more than our fair share of opportunities in this space. So, we do expect as the macro corrects, that we should see a pickup in connected devices. But right now, I'd say, visibility is quite short and we're just being really, really cautious.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And I also wanted to just talk about the inventory reduction that you've seen and the general supply environment. I know you've had some headwinds certainly in Auto, EV, and some other markets, are you starting to see some signs of supply easing or is that still a gating factor in Auto or some of your other businesses?\nMike Dastoor: So, Matt, the inventory did go down by seven days, sequentially the team has done a fantastic job. I think last quarter I had mentioned, I expect inventory to sort of bounce between 60 and 65 days in the short-to-medium term. We're seeing that coming through. In the longer term, we can take it down into the mid-to-high 50s, we're confident of that. But the supply chain remains patchy. It is sort of easing in a lot of areas, offset by constraints in others. So if you look at Automotive, you look at Semiconductors, you look at any power-related components, MCUs, all of them seem to be still in a constrained situation. So, we are seeing a mixed bag here on the supply chain side. The golden screw issue is still there. That's not gone away, although it's easing a little bit. So the best way to characterize this is, it is easing, but nowhere near normal yet. So, just something to keep watching, we're focused on it. And we'll continue to evolve out with the supply chain changes.\nKenny Wilson: I have a comment on that, just to support that of Mike's and just to give you some context. So, we are tracking, in the semiconductor space, the automotive semiconductors, and whereas 12 months ago we were tracking 1,200 components that were classed as golden screws for different assemblies, that number is probably half now as the number that we're managing, so it's down a lot, but it's still an issue for us that we continue to navigate. So, it's getting better for sure, but it's not gone yet.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.\nKenny Wilson: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good morning. Two questions from me as well. First off, thanks for the extra disclosure on Industrial and Auto. On the Industrial piece, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color as to how Jabil is differentiating in those markets. I know some of the programs you mentioned you've been in for quite a while, what's sort of changed beyond the secular that's driving that 40% growth? And then I have a follow-up.\nKenny Wilson: Yes, so, thanks, Steve. So, firstly, we get through a process every year, Steve, where we will look at our long-range plan, and we plan out three, four, five years. So, this hasn't just suddenly appeared as an opportunity for us. We've been looking at this for a long time. Brent Tompkins who runs that group has been really, really focused on, we need to develop capabilities to support things like grid-level energy storage, which would be new for us just from a scaling perspective, but also leaning into the things we've done historically in the EMS side of our business. So, it's been a little bit over, like for example, we opened a new facility in Salt Lake City. So, that's been a few years in the making, it's pretty much full now, we're looking to expand that with multiple customers which is good. So, it's really just been leaning it into our customers' roadmaps, looking at the capabilities that we have, augmenting that with other capabilities and been able to support things like, as we mentioned, grid-level energy storage which we see as a key area for us, smart power conversion, and energy management, so we're feeling pretty good that we're in -- we've got the right capabilities developed to be able to support our customers for the foreseeable future.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's super helpful. And then just on the Auto sort of an opposite end of spectrum financial question, which is, the growth is tremendous and it doesn't seem to be hurting the overall margins at all. But can you give us a sense for how that's possible, and yes, I would imagine that these aren't mature margins whatever you're producing within the Auto sector when you're growing 60%, so just sort of maybe give us a little perspective on that. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Yes, and look -- Steven, the good thing about the Auto industry for us is that, it's hard and the fact that it's hard means it's difficult for people to engage. So, I mean, you've seen our facilities. So the ability to introduce products globally, consistently, the same quality standards, use in complex automation, that's difficult. And your ability to get up to speed quickly as expected where you can lean into the margins in the short term. When Mike talked about this kind of that we've -- where your margin profile is under expectations as you go through the ramp and then normalizes above corporate averages. So, we're starting to get through that a little bit, although obviously we introduced new products and new programs and we're expanding our footprint, as you know. So I think it's albeit our ability to take a new product, deploy them, and ramp them globally is going to be what's going to dictate how effective our margins are, but we're doing a reasonable job there, I'd say. So, we're pretty bullish about where we will land in the future. I'd remind you also that we are active across multiple OEMs here. So, we've got opportunities coming out across the world with different customers, which makes us feel quite bullish about our future.\nMike Dastoor: And Steve, if I can just add, the product lifecycle in Automotive extends out to six or seven years. As you get deeper into the bulk of that -- that Kenny mentioned with some of the automation that we've introduced, it really suits long product life-cycle products such as automotive where operational efficiencies continue to drive margin even beyond end market sort of impact. So, just something to keep in mind that the longer a product lifecycle, the higher the operational efficiencies as a result of automation, which again drives margins upwards as well.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's all very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to talk a bit about the Healthcare business. Clearly, you've done well with the [indiscernible] relationship and that business continues to grow. I'm wondering where you're seeing the best opportunity looking forward, because I would assume this will be a pretty solid grower given demographics and everybody needs, unfortunately surgeries as they all get older. So if you can just provide a bit more there and then I had a question on margin. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Hey, Shannon. Nice to hear from you. Yes, so we approach Healthcare with in three kind of areas of focus, firstly, we got really good relationships with our current customer base and we look to expand that with -- whether it's in the med device, diagnostic, and pharma. And what we see a lot in each of those areas as the need for connected healthcare, so those opportunities, whether it's continuous glucose monitoring or sensors and so we see that we've got a really broad base of customers, capabilities, and markets and just as we continue to serve them well, we think that there's a real growth opportunity. I mean, an example would be, as you look at the auto-injectors we are making for diabetes and we make hundreds of millions of them a year. And then you look at the opportunity that comes out with -- for the weight reduction that you see with the drug there, so we are really -- really it's broad-based, and we're well-positioned and we feel quite bullish about our ability to grow that. I will tell you also about -- and healthcare moves at a slower pace than some of our other businesses. But we've got credibility and we're having more discussions about kind of B2B is where there's opportunities for us to do something not in the same scale as our JJ MV deal that we did, but we see opportunities come in for us in the longer term. So, yes, we think -- Andrew Priestley runs that business for us and his team have done a wonderful job and we're feeling quite bullish about where we end up in the longer-term in Healthcare.\nShannon Cross: Great. And then from a margin perspective, I understand that mix of revenue drives a significant amount of the margin movement on a quarterly basis, but kind of maybe as a follow-up to what Steve was asking about in Auto, can you talk about some of the other margin changes you've seen within some of your sub-categories, whether I don't know, networking or industrial as it becomes more renewables focused. Just to give an idea of sort of what's happening below the covers in terms of the margins. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Yes. Yes, sure. Let me take a swing at that and then Mike can help also. We are around, if I look year-over-year, we're up 60 basis points. And obviously, we think we've got 40 basis points for the year, so we're feeling pretty good about our margin profile and trajectory. We are, I think 60% of our business, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we think is business which is going to grow and continue to grow in the longer term. Things like -- we think that our Automotive will be -- Automotive and Healthcare should be above corporate averages. We think renewables will be, we mentioned that Semi-Cap being lower, we think that actually covers and that helps us. And we've done a lot of tidy up in the rest of our business to make sure that we're running, I mean, what we got to do also is we got to make sure we run good operations. If we run good operations, then especially operations, then we think we can give our customers good value. So, I don't know, hopefully that's helpful. Mike, you got any comment?\nMike Dastoor: I just had one sort of macro comment. I think more than -- end market secular trends are obviously driving a huge growth prospect for us, but above that sits the whole outsourcing of manufacturing as a trend as well which drives margins. If you look at the complex design requirements we have today, the dynamic supply chain market, the manufacturing at scale, and multiple geographies with strong local knowledge, localization of manufacturing, regionalization of manufacturing, and then you have automation driving a lot of this forward as well. So, that by itself is driving this entire outsourcing of manufacturing as a trend, which then leads into stickiness, which then leads into margin expansion as well and I would suggest that almost all of our end markets that we present here are seeing some sort of -- some sort of change in behavior from an industry standpoint. And specifically, for Jabil, from a capability standpoint as well. So, all good drivers of margin going forward, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Paul Chung from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So, nice progress on inventory, and your free cash flow conversion kind of continues to grow from 2021 level kind of rebounding there and guide for growth suggests kind of improved pace there, maybe potentially hitting free cash flow north of $1 billion for the first time. So, how do you think about the pace into 2024 and some of the dynamics across working cap?\nMike Dastoor: We'll continue to provide -- we'll provide some guidance on free cash flow 2024 in September, Paul, but you can expect the team to be completely focused on driving margins, driving free cash flow, and then using the free cash flow to continue to do buybacks because we think, we feel we're undervalued still. So I think that free cash flow conversion, expect that to continue to go up as well as working capital dynamics change. I don't think we get a one-for-one return if inventory goes down, doesn't mean all of that will flow through in free cash flow, because we have other means of offsetting some of the inventory sort of days through AR, through AP which we've been doing pretty effectively. So, expect free cash flows to continue to go up on an annual basis going forward, Paul, is the best way to describe it. And we'll provide more guidance in September.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then separately, are you starting to see evidence of some deflationary impact on components and which end markets are you seeing some bigger impact there and how do we think about the impact on revenue and margins into 2024 as kind of prices ease? Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Yes. We're not really seeing that, I mean there is puts and takes sometimes, Paul and it's not something that we're overly concerned about and it's not something that we think is going to impact our outlook for 2024. We think that we'll driving to north of 5% margins for 2024, obviously, we'll update that in September, but yet it's not something that's occupying a lot of our thoughts right now.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hi, thanks, guys. Congrats on another great quarter and really great working capital management. I just had a quick question on the interest expense, because it does have such a big impact on the core earnings. We're going to see it tick a little higher in the August quarter. I'm assuming that's driven by the inventory requirements tied to seasonality, first of all, is that correct? And then second, what should we expect for interest expense beyond August, maybe on a more normalized basis?\nMike Dastoor: So, Melissa, just to clarify, our interest cost in Q3 was $75 million. The guidance we provided for Q4 is in the $73 million range. So it's not going up, it's actually going down a little bit. I think we continue to benefit from working capital management. The team is highly focused. Some of the golden screw issues are easing, not as much as we'd like, but still on the right path. So, all-in-all, we feel that, that sort of a run-rate, especially in the first two or three quarters of FY 2024 continue after yesterday's Fed comments, it might be that sort of run rate for the entire year in FY 2024 as well.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay. Sorry about that. Little modeling snafu there. Maybe just as a follow-up, it seems AI is a hot topic these days, so I wanted to be sure you had the chance to talk about it. In the slides, you highlight cloud and AI/ML automation as being some of the growth drivers for 2024. You talked a little bit about the automation side of things, but maybe address what you're seeing in cloud and AI?\nKenny Wilson: Yes, thanks, Melissa. And actually, I'm going to [indiscernible] here because when we were preparing for the call, I was just back from an Asian tour within our facilities and I was really blown away by -- yes, I hadn't been there for a few years pre-pandemic and I was kind of blown away by just the improvements we\u2019ve made internally and using robotics, automation, you will get better non-value added activities and leaning into AI to help us with algorithms that help us introduce new products quickly from an inspection perspective, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, it was unbelievable that just how many people we've taken out of our processes by leading into automation and using an AI engine to support that. And we talk about that and I know that some people say that AI is going to be overhyped in short-term but obviously more beneficial in the longer term. But what we do see is and we are seeing, you need a lot of -- you need to teach these large language models, you need advanced network and obviously, you've got a lot of requirements for process and the cloud. So what we see is, but we think it's going to pick up over the longer term. But the ability to produce advanced networks and products and the ability to make your cloud devices where they require liquid cooling, they require high-speed optical interconnects, that plays to capabilities that we have been developing over a long period of time and that's why we're quite bullish in the longer-term from a cloud perspective because we're able to bring in multiple capabilities that we've developed in other parts of our business to support customers in that space, which is going to help them as we began request to support companies that are running large language models in the AI space. So, we think that for sure overheads in the short term, but we think in the longer term, it's going to be another real secular growth opportunity for us.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Great. Thanks very much.\nKenny Wilson: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. You mentioned you're planning for a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2024. As you see things today, are you thinking the macroeconomic environment is incrementally more difficult next year or is it more of a continuation of the kind of challenges you've been seeing?\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Mark. Just to clarify, I think the words I used, we're just being cautious and vigilant. There's a lot of chat around consumer end markets, we've seen some of that. It's a little bit patchy, it goes up, it comes down, for instance, Q2 was down, Q3 was actually up for us from a consumer standpoint, we're not seeing anything major in any of our end markets that would give us any concerns. I was just being cautious and vigilant, that's the only meaning behind my comments there. And if you look at the secular markets that we're in today, all growth-oriented, the EV, healthcare, renewables, 5G, cloud, they're all -- they're all moving in the right direction, so I don't think that gets slowed down by macroeconomic conditions that much, that might be instead of growing by double-digits, maybe it grows by single-digits. But overall, we're not seeing any of that right now. And we just want to be cautious and vigilant as well.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. Thank you, Mike. And my other question is, as you're seeing such good growth in certain markets like EVs and renewables, are there steps you have to take operationally in order to continue that growth, either more factory capacity, finding more labor and other constraints you may be running into given that the growth rate you've been undergoing in a couple of those key markets? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Yes, so on the EV side for example, yes, we have to expand our operations where we're expanding in the Americas, we're expanding in Europe, we are expanding in Asia. So, there is definitely -- we need to grow in our footprint in some of the geographies. Healthcare is a little bit more steady [indiscernible], but overall still the trend is upwards. Renewables, we've just opened a new factory in the US, but -- and we'll continue to expand as and when we feel the requirements are there. But yes, it is something we are watching, we're being very thoughtful, we're very disciplined. We don't want to over-invest in CapEx and we're watching trends very carefully to make sure there are long-term sustainable trends and not just hype which is temporary. So, yes, the answer to your question is, yes.\nKenny Wilson: And I call it follow up on that, Mark, also is that, we always talk about having a single instance of ACP in our company and that, for example, becomes critically important. As we look to get requests from customers to introduce new products, introduce them across multiple geographies, having that single instance of ACP is critically important, but more than that, we'd be JJ Creadon and his teams are looking at making sure that our factory network operates consistently with the same processes. We got a kind of unified table culture as I mentioned. So, our ability to incubate new business or new capabilities in one part of the world and then be able to deploy that at scale across the rest of our network really lends itself to our model. And so we're feeling quite bullish that we're really well-positioned to support the needs of our customers as you know, in the world where geographical manufacturing seems to be more invoked.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and good morning. I just want to go back to the AI automation conversation. I know you're probably going to provide a lot of color on this in September and I know it's early days, but when you think about sort of the end markets in your customer base, obviously there's going to be some technological shifts in what's happening, whether it's in the data center or the network stack, how does that work with you and your customers in terms of you potentially winning new types of businesses for new technological sort of changes effectively and generally, what are the lead times in terms of from concept discussion into deployment? And then I have a follow-up on margins, which I can maybe just roll-in here as well. So, it sounds like near term, the opportunity is for your own efficiency gains from automation going forward in fiscal 2024 from AI potentially, is that fair? Is that a fair way to think about the business next year? Thanks.\nKenny Wilson: Yes. So, for sure, and if I don't answer this question, David, like there was a lot there. So, for sure, internally, I mentioned previously that, you know, there are internal processes, we will simplify, optimize, standardize, and automate. We've been doing that forever. This helps us accelerate some of that as I had mentioned. So, we see that this is definitely going to be help us from our ability to introduce new products, ability to be more efficient, and therefore drive margins. So, for sure, we see that. And in terms of engagement with customers, I mean, we don't see any one of our end markets that isn't going to be favorable for whether it's in autonomous driving or in healthcare or whatever, and the relationships that we have are quite deep-rooted with our customers. We access their technology roadmaps and conjunction with them to help them introduce new products. So I think that the model, this isn't going to change the model that we have engagement what we have with our customers, like we got our technical expense of which will be felt then across the company, are actively engaged with customers looking at their roadmaps and how we can support them, so I think for sure that there'll be some acceleration there. But for us, it's almost business as usual as it comes to engaging with our customers.\nDavid Vogt: No, that's helpful. Maybe can I just ask a quick follow-up along those lines, do you -- I know it's early days, do you get the sense that maybe some customers would re-prioritize spending and roadmaps for maybe some existing sort of products and the roadmaps to really take advantage or jump on this new sort of large long-term secular driver in AI on anybody that have maybe some legacy [indiscernible] get de-emphasized?\nKenny Wilson: I don't think so. I mean I think that when people talk about that's been hyped in the short term, I think it's been hyped press in the short term. I think everyone who has been involved in our industry and the industry, you know, AMD talked about it yesterday, NVIDIA, I mean, they haven't just woke up yesterday and decided this it's a good idea, they've have been working on this roadmap for multiple years, so I think there's a little bit of hype in the press. But to those who are involved in the industry, I think it's just like a continuation of the roadmaps we've been working on.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. So, it sounds like it's an additive. That's helpful, Kenny. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Yes, yes.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: This is the end of our call. Thank you for joining. Please reach out if you have any further questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Through the first nine months of fiscal year, the team has posted solid top-line growth, improved core operating income by more than twice the pace of revenue growth, and grew core EPS by 16%, while also expanding core operating margins by 30 basis points, a solid performance by the team. As you heard from Adam, our growth and improved profitability this year continues to be driven by areas of our business benefiting from secular growth like electric vehicles, healthcare, renewable energy infrastructure, and cloud. All-in-all, our solid performance year-to-date gives us excellent momentum as we enter the final quarter of FY 2023. With that, on the next slide, you'll see our fourth quarter guidance. For Q4, we expect total company revenues to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.8 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $424 million to $484 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $400 million to $460 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.50. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.32. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be $73 million which is lower than we forecasted in March, reflecting better working capital management by the team. Moving to the next slide where I'll offer an update on our end market demand assumptions and how these translate to our FY 2023 revenue expectations. At a high level, our assumptions remain largely consistent with our March update. We continue to be conservative in our approach given the current macroeconomic dynamics and expect strong growth from our secular markets to be slightly offset by lower demand in some of our consumer-facing markets and in Semi-Cap. In our Automotive end-market, EV growth continues to be robust, limited only by the pace at which we can scale up production across multiple geographies with several OEMs. In Healthcare, the outsourcing of manufacturing trend continues to play out as we are seeing increased activity with interest from multiple OEMs exploring our capabilities. Growth expectations for our Industrials business have also improved since March, driven higher by renewable energy infrastructure. Specifically, we're seeing good growth in solar inverters, smart meters, energy storage, and power and building management solutions. We now expect our Industrials business to be up more than 25% in FY 2023. This growth has been slightly offset by incremental end market weakness in our Semi-Cap business. In summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand across many of our end markets to remain strong. We now expect revenue for FY 2023 to be $34.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year which is $200 million, about what we thought in March. Considering this updated growth outlook, let's now turn to the next slide, to get a view of our updated guidance for FY 2023. Notably, we see income coming through with the increase to revenue. We now expect to deliver core operating income of $1.71 billion, a year-over-year increase of approximately 11%, while holding core margins at 4.9%. This 4.9% represents a growth of approximately 30 basis points year-on-year. With the additional income, we are now anticipating core EPS will be $8.50. We remain committed to generating more than $900 million in free cash flow this year. Beyond FY 2023, we expect our secular markets to continue to drive growth. I also believe our margins will continue to expand with the combination of our positive mix-shift towards higher-margin end-markets and operational efficiencies driven by automation and internal use of AI and ML technologies. In summary, the team is executing extremely well. I expect our strong momentum to continue into FY 2024, although we remain cautious and vigilant on the near-term macroeconomic conditions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kenny. Hey, Ruplu. Yes, the ROIC that we reported is in the 30% range. We normally target in that 25%, 30%. If you look at our working capital management, the way we use our invested capital, our CapEx, and all the factors that makeup invested capital, we're extremely disciplined on that. The returns are coming in. So, the numerator and denominator on the ROIC calculator or the ROIC calculation is actually quite robust and strong, and you can expect those levels of ROIC going forward as well, Ruplu. So, Matt, the inventory did go down by seven days, sequentially the team has done a fantastic job. I think last quarter I had mentioned, I expect inventory to sort of bounce between 60 and 65 days in the short-to-medium term. We're seeing that coming through. In the longer term, we can take it down into the mid-to-high 50s, we're confident of that. But the supply chain remains patchy. It is sort of easing in a lot of areas, offset by constraints in others. So if you look at Automotive, you look at Semiconductors, you look at any power-related components, MCUs, all of them seem to be still in a constrained situation. So, we are seeing a mixed bag here on the supply chain side. The golden screw issue is still there. That's not gone away, although it's easing a little bit. So the best way to characterize this is, it is easing, but nowhere near normal yet. So, just something to keep watching, we're focused on it. And we'll continue to evolve out with the supply chain changes. And Steve, if I can just add, the product lifecycle in Automotive extends out to six or seven years. As you get deeper into the bulk of that -- that Kenny mentioned with some of the automation that we've introduced, it really suits long product life-cycle products such as automotive where operational efficiencies continue to drive margin even beyond end market sort of impact. So, just something to keep in mind that the longer a product lifecycle, the higher the operational efficiencies as a result of automation, which again drives margins upwards as well. I just had one sort of macro comment. I think more than -- end market secular trends are obviously driving a huge growth prospect for us, but above that sits the whole outsourcing of manufacturing as a trend as well which drives margins. If you look at the complex design requirements we have today, the dynamic supply chain market, the manufacturing at scale, and multiple geographies with strong local knowledge, localization of manufacturing, regionalization of manufacturing, and then you have automation driving a lot of this forward as well. So, that by itself is driving this entire outsourcing of manufacturing as a trend, which then leads into stickiness, which then leads into margin expansion as well and I would suggest that almost all of our end markets that we present here are seeing some sort of -- some sort of change in behavior from an industry standpoint. And specifically, for Jabil, from a capability standpoint as well. So, all good drivers of margin going forward, Shannon. We'll continue to provide -- we'll provide some guidance on free cash flow 2024 in September, Paul, but you can expect the team to be completely focused on driving margins, driving free cash flow, and then using the free cash flow to continue to do buybacks because we think, we feel we're undervalued still. So I think that free cash flow conversion, expect that to continue to go up as well as working capital dynamics change. I don't think we get a one-for-one return if inventory goes down, doesn't mean all of that will flow through in free cash flow, because we have other means of offsetting some of the inventory sort of days through AR, through AP which we've been doing pretty effectively. So, expect free cash flows to continue to go up on an annual basis going forward, Paul, is the best way to describe it. And we'll provide more guidance in September. So, Melissa, just to clarify, our interest cost in Q3 was $75 million. The guidance we provided for Q4 is in the $73 million range. So it's not going up, it's actually going down a little bit. I think we continue to benefit from working capital management. The team is highly focused. Some of the golden screw issues are easing, not as much as we'd like, but still on the right path. So, all-in-all, we feel that, that sort of a run-rate, especially in the first two or three quarters of FY 2024 continue after yesterday's Fed comments, it might be that sort of run rate for the entire year in FY 2024 as well. Hey, Mark. Just to clarify, I think the words I used, we're just being cautious and vigilant. There's a lot of chat around consumer end markets, we've seen some of that. It's a little bit patchy, it goes up, it comes down, for instance, Q2 was down, Q3 was actually up for us from a consumer standpoint, we're not seeing anything major in any of our end markets that would give us any concerns.

But overall, we're not seeing any of that right now. And we just want to be cautious and vigilant as well. Yes, so on the EV side for example, yes, we have to expand our operations where we're expanding in the Americas, we're expanding in Europe, we are expanding in Asia. So, there is definitely -- we need to grow in our footprint in some of the geographies. Healthcare is a little bit more steady [indiscernible], but overall still the trend is upwards. Renewables, we've just opened a new factory in the US, but -- and we'll continue to expand as and when we feel the requirements are there. But yes, it is something we are watching, we're being very thoughtful, we're very disciplined. We don't want to over-invest in CapEx and we're watching trends very carefully to make sure there are long-term sustainable trends and not just hype which is temporary. So, yes, the answer to your question is, yes."

            "name": "Kenny Wilson",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As you heard from Adam and Mike, our business is in good shape and the team has executed well this year in what continues to be a dynamic operating environment. The success we are seeing across our business is a key proof point of our teams' ability to leverage multiple capabilities across disparate end markets, as we continue to diversify our service offerings, underpinning our improving financial performance. Let's turn to the next slide where you'll see our updated outlook for fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect good year-over-year growth and operating leverage this year, which gives us the confidence to raise our expectations for core EPS by $0.10 to $8.50. At the same time, we remain highly focused on delivering more than $900 million in free cash flow. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin and free cash flow expansion as we look to fiscal year 2024. In fact, when I look at the growth in our business this year, it's worth highlighting that nearly 60% of our portfolio [indiscernible] the markets with strong secular growth, specifically, electric vehicles, renewable energy, healthcare, and 5G and cloud. Our Automotive business continues its healthy growth rate as the team navigates multiple complex program introductions, increasing both our scale and addressable content per vehicle. Jabil continues to be extremely well-positioned to support our customers as they accelerate their transition to EVs in the coming years. And in our Industrial business, we are supporting customers as they navigate the rapid transition towards clean energy. Over the last several years, we've invested heavily in capabilities to support energy storage, energy conversion, and grid-level power management solutions, which are now been deployed across multiple months at scale. Although we are in the early days of growth in this space, as government policies like the Inflation Reduction Act in the US mature and scale, Jabil is extremely well-positioned to support our customers in the coming years. In Healthcare, we continue to capitalize on the trend to outsource manufacturing, and our credibility with some of the leading OEMs in this space has positioned us well for future growth. Another area that is increasingly coming into focus for us is in the AI and ML space. This has implications both on the growth side of our business across multiple end markets, but also has the potential to drive efficiencies across our internal processes and factory network. As it relates to our internal processes, we are capturing data and using the latest toolkits to help improve our operations. [indiscernible] don't view this as a new initiative. We know the next step and a continuous improvement path we've been on for many years. Our operating system naturally drives us to simplify, standardize, optimize, and automate processes and this in conjunction with our enhanced ability to mine big data which ultimately drives sustainable improvements. In September, the Jabil team will go deeper in all of these areas at our Investor Briefing. At that event, we plan to offer our fiscal year 2024 financial outlook as we continue to prioritize growth in core margins and cash flows. Specifically, we will lay out how we plan to increase revenue, while also expanding core operating margins beyond 5%, and we plan to increase free cash flow by continuing to invest in growth. We provide another year of solid core EPS growth, and finally, provide an update on our capital return frameworks. In closing, I feel strongly that we have the right team, capabilities, and diversified portfolio to support strong momentum into the final quarter of fiscal year 2023 and beyond. And none of this would be possible without a thriving and unified Jabil culture which is as strong today as it has ever been. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Adam. Hey, Ruplu, it's Kenny, and good morning. Yes, it's a great question, and in fact just this morning, I was reading an article about the covered AI and it talked about the semiconductor space and just the wafer fabrication equipment and the demand and how that increases through 2024, 2025, and 2026, so I would say that we are -- our view is quite consistent with yours that we think that although it's a low right now, that's going to -- that's going to pick-up in the probably the second half of calendar 2024 and beyond. So, remember that we try and we diversify the all end markets and we're very well-diversified in this market also from a front-end to back-end perspective. We've been expanding our footprint across the world and anticipation of the pickup in demand through the back-end of next year, so we got a pretty competent team there that are ready and we're ready to build the demand for our customers when demand picks up through the back-end of next year. So we feel really, really good about where we are from a Semi-Cap perspective. Yes, you're welcome. Yes, I think Mike mentioned it quite well in his prepared remarks about that we're cautious of the near-term macro. We're very, very well-diversified in the connected devices space and -- but sometimes you get pleasant surprises in the upside like we had in Q3, but we still think it's choppy and spotty and we think we're bumped along the bottom. I would also mention, Matt, that as we look at our business here, we did get a COVID pickup effectively and we're probably run at the run rates that we were in 2019, 2020, 2021, that kind of level. That said, we have won more than our fair share of opportunities in this space. So, we do expect as the macro corrects, that we should see a pickup in connected devices. But right now, I'd say, visibility is quite short and we're just being really, really cautious. I have a comment on that, just to support that of Mike's and just to give you some context. So, we are tracking, in the semiconductor space, the automotive semiconductors, and whereas 12 months ago we were tracking 1,200 components that were classed as golden screws for different assemblies, that number is probably half now as the number that we're managing, so it's down a lot, but it's still an issue for us that we continue to navigate. So, it's getting better for sure, but it's not gone yet. You're welcome. Yes, so, thanks, Steve. So, firstly, we get through a process every year, Steve, where we will look at our long-range plan, and we plan out three, four, five years. So, this hasn't just suddenly appeared as an opportunity for us. We've been looking at this for a long time. Brent Tompkins who runs that group has been really, really focused on, we need to develop capabilities to support things like grid-level energy storage, which would be new for us just from a scaling perspective, but also leaning into the things we've done historically in the EMS side of our business. So, it's been a little bit over, like for example, we opened a new facility in Salt Lake City. So, that's been a few years in the making, it's pretty much full now, we're looking to expand that with multiple customers which is good. So, it's really just been leaning it into our customers' roadmaps, looking at the capabilities that we have, augmenting that with other capabilities and been able to support things like, as we mentioned, grid-level energy storage which we see as a key area for us, smart power conversion, and energy management, so we're feeling pretty good that we're in -- we've got the right capabilities developed to be able to support our customers for the foreseeable future. Yes, and look -- Steven, the good thing about the Auto industry for us is that, it's hard and the fact that it's hard means it's difficult for people to engage. So, I mean, you've seen our facilities. So the ability to introduce products globally, consistently, the same quality standards, use in complex automation, that's difficult. And your ability to get up to speed quickly as expected where you can lean into the margins in the short term. When Mike talked about this kind of that we've -- where your margin profile is under expectations as you go through the ramp and then normalizes above corporate averages. So, we're starting to get through that a little bit, although obviously we introduced new products and new programs and we're expanding our footprint, as you know. So I think it's albeit our ability to take a new product, deploy them, and ramp them globally is going to be what's going to dictate how effective our margins are, but we're doing a reasonable job there, I'd say. So, we're pretty bullish about where we will land in the future. I'd remind you also that we are active across multiple OEMs here. So, we've got opportunities coming out across the world with different customers, which makes us feel quite bullish about our future. Hey, Shannon. Nice to hear from you. Yes, so we approach Healthcare with in three kind of areas of focus, firstly, we got really good relationships with our current customer base and we look to expand that with -- whether it's in the med device, diagnostic, and pharma. And what we see a lot in each of those areas as the need for connected healthcare, so those opportunities, whether it's continuous glucose monitoring or sensors and so we see that we've got a really broad base of customers, capabilities, and markets and just as we continue to serve them well, we think that there's a real growth opportunity. I mean, an example would be, as you look at the auto-injectors we are making for diabetes and we make hundreds of millions of them a year. And then you look at the opportunity that comes out with -- for the weight reduction that you see with the drug there, so we are really -- really it's broad-based, and we're well-positioned and we feel quite bullish about our ability to grow that. I will tell you also about -- and healthcare moves at a slower pace than some of our other businesses. But we've got credibility and we're having more discussions about kind of B2B is where there's opportunities for us to do something not in the same scale as our JJ MV deal that we did, but we see opportunities come in for us in the longer term. So, yes, we think -- Andrew Priestley runs that business for us and his team have done a wonderful job and we're feeling quite bullish about where we end up in the longer-term in Healthcare. Yes. Yes, sure. Let me take a swing at that and then Mike can help also. We are around, if I look year-over-year, we're up 60 basis points. And obviously, we think we've got 40 basis points for the year, so we're feeling pretty good about our margin profile and trajectory. We are, I think 60% of our business, as I've said in my prepared remarks, we think is business which is going to grow and continue to grow in the longer term. Things like -- we think that our Automotive will be -- Automotive and Healthcare should be above corporate averages. We think renewables will be, we mentioned that Semi-Cap being lower, we think that actually covers and that helps us. And we've done a lot of tidy up in the rest of our business to make sure that we're running, I mean, what we got to do also is we got to make sure we run good operations. If we run good operations, then especially operations, then we think we can give our customers good value. So, I don't know, hopefully that's helpful. Mike, you got any comment? Yes. We're not really seeing that, I mean there is puts and takes sometimes, Paul and it's not something that we're overly concerned about and it's not something that we think is going to impact our outlook for 2024. We think that we'll driving to north of 5% margins for 2024, obviously, we'll update that in September, but yet it's not something that's occupying a lot of our thoughts right now. Yes, thanks, Melissa. And actually, I'm going to [indiscernible] here because when we were preparing for the call, I was just back from an Asian tour within our facilities and I was really blown away by -- yes, I hadn't been there for a few years pre-pandemic and I was kind of blown away by just the improvements we've made internally and using robotics, automation, you will get better non-value added activities and leaning into AI to help us with algorithms that help us introduce new products quickly from an inspection perspective, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, it was unbelievable that just how many people we've taken out of our processes by leading into automation and using an AI engine to support that. And we talk about that and I know that some people say that AI is going to be overhyped in short-term but obviously more beneficial in the longer term. But what we do see is and we are seeing, you need a lot of -- you need to teach these large language models, you need advanced network and obviously, you've got a lot of requirements for process and the cloud. So what we see is, but we think it's going to pick up over the longer term. But the ability to produce advanced networks and products and the ability to make your cloud devices where they require liquid cooling, they require high-speed optical interconnects, that plays to capabilities that we have been developing over a long period of time and that's why we're quite bullish in the longer-term from a cloud perspective because we're able to bring in multiple capabilities that we've developed in other parts of our business to support customers in that space, which is going to help them as we began request to support companies that are running large language models in the AI space. So, we think that for sure overheads in the short term, but we think in the longer term, it's going to be another real secular growth opportunity for us. You're welcome. And I call it follow up on that, Mark, also is that, we always talk about having a single instance of ACP in our company and that, for example, becomes critically important. As we look to get requests from customers to introduce new products, introduce them across multiple geographies, having that single instance of ACP is critically important, but more than that, we'd be JJ Creadon and his teams are looking at making sure that our factory network operates consistently with the same processes. We got a kind of unified table culture as I mentioned. So, our ability to incubate new business or new capabilities in one part of the world and then be able to deploy that at scale across the rest of our network really lends itself to our model. And so we're feeling quite bullish that we're really well-positioned to support the needs of our customers as you know, in the world where geographical manufacturing seems to be more invoked. Yes. So, for sure, and if I don't answer this question, David, like there was a lot there. So, for sure, internally, I mentioned previously that, you know, there are internal processes, we will simplify, optimize, standardize, and automate. We've been doing that forever. This helps us accelerate some of that as I had mentioned. So, we see that this is definitely going to be help us from our ability to introduce new products, ability to be more efficient, and therefore drive margins. So, for sure, we see that. And in terms of engagement with customers, I mean, we don't see any one of our end markets that isn't going to be favorable for whether it's in autonomous driving or in healthcare or whatever, and the relationships that we have are quite deep-rooted with our customers. We access their technology roadmaps and conjunction with them to help them introduce new products. So I think that the model, this isn't going to change the model that we have engagement what we have with our customers, like we got our technical expense of which will be felt then across the company, are actively engaged with customers looking at their roadmaps and how we can support them, so I think for sure that there'll be some acceleration there. But for us, it's almost business as usual as it comes to engaging with our customers. I don't think so. I mean I think that when people talk about that's been hyped in the short term, I think it's been hyped press in the short term. I think everyone who has been involved in our industry and the industry, you know, AMD talked about it yesterday, NVIDIA, I mean, they haven't just woke up yesterday and decided this it's a good idea, they've have been working on this roadmap for multiple years, so I think there's a little bit of hype in the press. But to those who are involved in the industry, I think it's just like a continuation of the roadmaps we've been working on. Yes, yes."

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Adam.\nAdam Berry: Good morning. And welcome to Jabil\u2019s second quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Chairman and CEO, Mark Mondello; incoming CEO, Kenny Wilson; and CFO, Mike Dastoor. In terms of agenda, Mike, Kenny and I will be offering today\u2019s prepared remarks, while Mark will join for the question-and-answer session. Please note that today\u2019s call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations section of our website. At the conclusion of today\u2019s call, a recording of the entirety will be posted for audio playback on our website. I\u2019d now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022 and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I\u2019d now like to shift our focus to our second quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.1 billion in revenue in line with our forecast. As you dig a little deeper, it\u2019s worth noting we saw strength in areas such as industrial, driven by continued robust demand for renewable energy generation and storage, automotive driven by the transition to electric vehicles, and healthcare as large OEMs in that space continue to partner with Jabil to deliver best-in-class personal care. Conversely, a portion of the year-over-year strength was offset by weakness in Semi-Cap and other consumer-oriented portions of our business. Putting it all together at the enterprise level, revenue grew by an impressive 8% year-over-year. Core operating income during the quarter was $391 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.8%. This is up 20 basis points over the prior year and just ahead of our expectations from 90 days ago based on great operational execution within our EMS businesses. Net interest in the quarter came in higher than expectations at $74 million. In the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares for $127 million leaving us with $975 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $359 million our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.52. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.88, a 12% improvement over the prior year quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our range. Now turning to the segments, revenue for the DMS segment was $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis and in line with our expectations, while core operating margin for the segment came in at 4.6% as expected, as a result of strong returns in auto and health care, offset by weakness in consumer markets. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.1 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year, while core margins for the segment was 5.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year reflecting solid leverage on strong revenue growth. So in summary, a strong close to the first half of our fiscal year. As we sit today, I know the team here is extremely proud of the strides we have made to not only improve our business over the last several years, but also make it more strong and more resilient. This improved resiliency in our business was reflected in the Q2 results. In a moment, I will turn the call over to Mike and Kenny to provide some additional thoughts on our performance in the quarter and update our outlook for fiscal 2023 and I think you will see there\u2019s so much opportunity as we look towards fiscal 2024 and beyond. Thanks for your time today. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Q2 marked a solid close to the first half of the fiscal year. Through the first two quarters of FY 2023, the team delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, core operating income and core earnings per share, while also expanding core margins by 20 basis points compared to the first half of FY 2022. Growth year-to-date has been headlined by areas of our businesses experiencing long-term secular growth trends, offset slightly by some of our more consumer centric markets and Semi-Cap. The team\u2019s impressive performance through the first half of our fiscal year, despite what continues to be an extremely dynamic macroeconomic environment underscores the strength of our diversified portfolio and the improved resiliency of our business. Next, I\u2019d like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q2 beginning with inventory, which came in higher than expected mainly due to timing and continued component constraints on the automotive supply chain. The team did a good job offsetting a portion of our inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers. Net of these deposits, inventory days was 69 in Q2. We continue to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY 2023 and beyond, targeting net inventory days ranging between 60 days to 65 days in the medium-term and expecting to normalize in the 55 days to 60 days range in the long-term. Our second quarter cash flows from operations came in at $414 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $304 million. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.2 billion and a total debt to core EBITDA level of approximately 1.1. Turning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide, we expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue will both be $4.1 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $363 million to $423 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $336 million to $396 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.90. Net interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately $80 million and for the year to be in the range of $295 million to $300 million, which is higher than we forecasted in December, due to more conservative interest rate and working capital assumptions. As inventory levels normalize, I expect these interest costs to gradually decrease over the mid- to long-term. Tax rate on core earnings in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 19%. Moving to the next slide, where I will offer an update on the end market demand assumptions and how these translate to our FY 2023 revenue expectations. At a high level, our year so far is playing out consistent with our assumptions in December. The industry continues to benefit from outsourcing of manufacturing as a macro trend due to dynamics such as onshoring closer to end consumers, complex supply chain dynamics and greater content due to ever increasing design complexities and products. We continue to expect areas of our businesses benefiting from strong long-term secular growth trends like electric vehicles, healthcare, renewable energy infrastructure, 5G and cloud to drive solid year-over-year growth. An area where our outlook has improved since December is in our industrial business where we see robust demand for renewable energy infrastructure, which we expect to drive double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Electric vehicle demand also continues to remain extremely strong as we continue to gain share in an end market with strong robust growth as we navigate product manufacturing life cycles and ramps at different stages in their maturity curves, constrained by a tight component supply chain. We expect a portion of the solid growth from our secular markets to be offset by lower demand in our consumer-facing markets and in Semi-Cap. In summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect the secular demand across many of our end markets to remain strong. Considering this updated demand picture, let\u2019s now turn to the next slide to get a view of our updated guidance for FY 2023. We expect our improved mix of business will drive incremental operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margins by 10 basis points to 4.9% for FY 2023 on revenue of $34.5 billion. We continue to anticipate core EPS will be $8.40, which is reflective of our improved core operating income, offset by higher interest expense. Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating an excess of $900 million in free cash flow. Overall, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year and drive the company to core margins beyond 5%. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Kenny.\nKenny Wilson: Thanks, Mike. I am pleased to be joining the call today. It is truly humbling to reflect back 23 years to when I joined Jabil in our manufacturing facility in Livingston, Scotland. Since then I have been afforded the opportunity to grow and lead several areas of our business. Most recently, I had the privilege to live and work in Asia, leading our Jabil Green Point organization, which has played a major role in building out multiple key capabilities that continue to be leverage across the company. Going forward, I am excited to lead Jabil as CEO, alongside a team of extremely talented and long tenured industry leaders. I would like to share a few thoughts on what you should expect from us going forward. As Mark mentioned 90 days ago, think of this as evolutionary, not revolutionary, it is our term to carry the torch and prepare our organization for future growth. First, we have a customer-centric organization, always have been, always will be. As such, we will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers and shareholders to deliver long-term value. Second, we will continue to cultivate our unique culture, which attracts, retains, empowers and enables our people, allowing their true self to turn up to work every day. Third, we will remain focused on increasing margins and delivering sustainable free cash flow through a combination of enhancing the mix of our business and excellent operational execution. It\u2019s my belief that this in turn will allow us to earn an appropriate return on investment for the value we provide. Moving on to our business, today we see incredible tailwinds driving our business forward. For instance, this year, we are seeing robust growth in our industrial business in areas like renewable energy generation and storage. In automotive, the team continues to navigate multiple complex program introductions, increasing both our scale and addressable content per vehicle. And in healthcare, we continue to win new business in areas such as digital health and precision medicine as the industry outsource trend accelerates. The success we are seeing in these areas is a key proof point of our team\u2019s ability to leverage multiple capabilities across fiscal end markets as we continue to diversify our service offerings. Moving on to the year, I am pleased with the momentum underway in the business. We expect good growth and operating leverage, which gives us the confidence to raise our expectations for core margins to 4.9% for fiscal 2023. At the same time, we remain highly focused on delivering more than $900 million in free cash flow and when I think about Jabil beyond fiscal year 2023, there is a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead. Between the mix of business and the growth trends underpinned by our long tenured management team, I am confident that we can drive the company at above 5% core margins with sustainable strong cash flows. This will afford us tremendous flexibility in our capital allocation. In the coming years, we will remain focused on executing buybacks when they produce strong returns for shareholders and remain committed to a dividend. As it relates to M&A, you will see us continue to focus on capability building deals consistent with the past several years. And finally, we will ensure our capital structure is optimized and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. In closing, I feel it is appropriate to send a message to our people here at Jabil. I have spent over 20 years at our company and I am excited to be a leader. I will strive to make you proud. At Jabil, our people are our greatest asset. Our strength is in our ability to bring together a collection of people from diverse backgrounds, different experiences and multiple generations and moved into a culture that across the world is both consistent and a true differentiator. Being no doubt that all that matters every day is that you give away your best, focus on performance and strive to be the leader or coworker you wish you had. In summary, bring your true self to work each and every day without anxiety or fear of recourse. I am truly grateful to each and every one of you for all that you do. I will now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Kenny. Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Kenny, good to have you on Board and on the earnings call. Let me start by asking you a question on automotive. Jabil\u2019s revenue from automotive has been pretty strong and you have been manufacturing components, like you said, for EVs for a long time. However, this space may get crowded over the next two years to three years, I am thinking about media reports indicating at least one large Taiwanese EMS company looking to manufacture EVs. So when you look over the next two year, three years, do you think Jabil has a competitive advantage in this space that can sustain over the medium-term and how much of your auto revenues today are from EVs and do you see that percent growing over the next few years?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. Thanks for the message, Ruplu. I really appreciate it. Yeah. So, as you know, the EMS, the automotive industry when you do automotive business, you have got to be -- it takes you a while to get qualified. The programs run for five years, six years, seven years. You also got to be able to leverage that capability consistently in multiple geographies across the world. So that kind of plays to our strength and we see that -- for sure we think there\u2019s enough opportunity and enough heeding for multiple different suppliers or competitors. So, yes, we are pretty confident that, we have got a value proposition that\u2019s going to see us continue to grow our business in automotive in the longer term. In terms of -- in the EV space, if we look at our total automotive business, it\u2019s in the order of 80% to 90% of our business now is kind of EV and autonomous. So I think you should expect -- we are pretty confident that basically we are well positioned. We have got business with most of the large OEMs and we are very, very confident that\u2019s going to grow and continue across multiple geographies in the future.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks, Kenny, for the details there. For my follow-up, let me ask a question to Mike. So you beat the midpoint of your fiscal 2Q EPS guide by about $0.04 and you are raising the operating margin outlook for fiscal 2023 looks like by 10 bps, but you kept the full year EPS guide of $8.40. So my question is, Mike, when you look at the remaining year, at the second half of the year, do you see a weaker operating environment in the second half or is there some conservatism in the guidance, just if you can give us your thoughts? And also, EMS had a very strong margin performance in fiscal 2Q, do you think that will sustain going forward? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Yeah. Thanks. So, if you look at EBIT. EBIT has grown from December by about $25 million, but on the other side of the coin, interest costs have gone up as well, our business -- our operating business, our secular trends, all the end markets that we perform in, that\u2019s actually going really well. Performance is stronger than we have anticipated. So we have taken EBIT up. Unfortunately, we have had a slightly higher level of inventory, mainly due to couple of reasons. There\u2019s timing where inventory came in at the end of the quarter. The opposite side of that shows up in AP. So I am not that worried about that piece. But the auto supply chain continues to be tight. We sort of anticipated it improving over the quarter and the rest of the year. We are not seeing that. So it\u2019s not getting worse, but it\u2019s not getting any better either. So there\u2019s inventory and then on the interest side, obviously, the short end of the interest rate curve has steepened over the last 10 weeks, 12 weeks, notwithstanding the last three days or four days. The short-term borrowings that we have to finance our working capital has gone up as well. So it\u2019s a little bit of a positive story and that our underlying business is performing really well. We are having some level of temporary issues with inventory and interest rates. If you look at the other side of that, when we come out of this at some point in time over the next three quarters, four quarters, interest rates, interest costs, everything should subside at our inventory levels should be much better as well. So right now, our inventory is in that 68 days, 69 days sort of the net inventory that we have announced. The expectation is for it to be in the 60 days, 65 days in the medium-term and I actually expect it to go down to 55 days, 60 days in the long-term as well. So, plenty of positive momentum to come at some point in the future as well, Ruplu.\nMark Mondello: Hey, Ruplu. This is\u2026\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay.\nMark Mondello: Ruplu, this is Mark. If I could add a comment, listening to Mike\u2019s response, with everything we got going on, the macro the way it is today, if you think about the back half of the year and again, adding to what Mike said, our DMS margins for the second half are going to be in the range of 5%, which is right where they thought -- we thought they would be in September, and by the way, that\u2019s with consumer getting hit pretty hard, at least temporarily. The EMS margins for the second half of the year are going to be in the range now of about 5%, maybe even slightly stronger, that\u2019s going to be 30 bps, 40 bps higher than where we thought we would be in September. And the enterprise margin for the second half of the year is now also going to be in the range of 5%. That\u2019s 10 bps, 20 bps higher than what we thought it would be back in September. And then if you kind of take that tangentially in a different manner, we have got margins from 22% at an enterprise level of being 4.6%. And as you alluded to in your question, we are going to be up 30 bps at an enterprise level year-on-year. So all things considered, the business has been run and executed really, really well.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Mark thanks for all the details there and congrats on the strong execution.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning. Two questions if I could. Just one follow-up on the auto details that you provided. When we think about the really tremendous growth you have had the last two years, I assume it slows next year. How do we think about sort of the impact this growth has had on margin mix, et cetera, and as it slows, what\u2019s the impact to margins overall? And as a second question, I was just curious if you could expand on the comment about outsourcing accelerating in digital health and precision medicine, like, any further color around what that means for Jabil? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Steve. Are you saying or suggesting. I couldn\u2019t quite hear you correctly. Are you saying automotive is going to slow next year?\nSteven Fox: Well, I am assuming hitting 50% growth again for the third year in a row might be difficult, but I could be wrong on that?\nMark Mondello: So we have done\u2026.\nSteven Fox: I am not\u2026\nMark Mondello: I didn\u2019t know. I just wanted to clarify. I don\u2019t know if you are asking in terms of a macro slowdown, slowdown to Jabil, slowdown in absolute dollars or slowdown on our CAGR growth rates, so?\nSteven Fox: Yeah. I was talking about your specific growth rate market.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. That\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s fair. We have come off of, I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers, but I think 2021 to 2022, the business grew north of 40%, 2022 to 2023 if things hold, it will grow north of 40%. I don\u2019t think next year, it\u2019s going to grow north of 40%. But I think, if I had to speculate, I think, of our eight sectors, I think, automotive and transport will certainly be towards the top in terms of growth 2023 to 2024 on a relative basis. I mentioned on Ruplu\u2019s question on how the margins, I think, again, when we look at the back half of the year, we are really, really satisfied, excuse me, with overall margins and really satisfied with margins taking it up 10 bps for the year. Intertwined in that, though, is we have a ton of activity going on in auto EVs at the moment and there\u2019s a lot of that activity that hasn\u2019t reached maturity yet and we expect it to do so in 2024. So almost independent of whether the growth is 10%, 20%, 30% next year. I think the activity and the efforts we are putting into that space at the moment are going to have a good result and a good outlook and outcome in 2024.\nSteven Fox: Thanks for that. And then in terms of the health care outsourcing accelerating?\nMark Mondello: I think we -- we have been saying this since we did the JJMD deal and then we got hit with COVID. I think, philosophically, we are directionally correct in our hypothesis around opportunities to be able to capture more and more outsourcing in the personalized digital overall healthcare space. As you know, it\u2019s a very, very, let\u2019s just say, formal marketplace. So decisions are very well thought as they should be with a lot of patients being involved. But nothing\u2019s changed at all in terms of our overall thoughts and commentary we have been making the last couple of years in terms of how that market looks for us and how we are positioned for that market. I think timing has been a little bit slower than we anticipated, but nonetheless, the trajectory of that is still in really good shape.\nSteven Fox: Great. That\u2019s a very helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I have got two questions, they may be related, so I will just ask them both at once. It\u2019s great to see you raise the full year revenue target for industrial and Semi-Cap. You did mention the strong growth in renewables. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your expectations for the other businesses in that segment, Semi-Cap and elsewhere? And then as a second, very nice move higher on the operating margin target for EMS as Mark highlighted, what\u2019s driving that upside? Thanks.\nMark Mondello: Okay. I will start and Mike and Kenny can chime in. I think the beginning of the year, we thought industrial Semi-Cap would be, I don\u2019t remember the exact numbers, but say, around $4.2 billion, $4.3 billion. We have got that now indexed around $4.5 billion. The nice thing is we are seeing, and again, this is just another statement of how important it is to lean into the diversification of the business today. But we are seeing some overall weakness in Semi-Cap. Again, down the road, we think that, that makes a nice recovery, even with that combined industrial Semi-Cap compared to September is going to be up $200 million and maybe a little bit more than that. I think a big part of that is we are absolutely seeing benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. So when we think about the portion of our industrial business that leans hard into solar, hard into clean energy, renewables, that\u2019s beneficial and we -- as we think about FY 2024, we think there will be continued benefit there. What was the second part of your question?\nMelissa Fairbanks: Just wondering if that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s driving the higher operating margin target for EMS, just a mix up or is there is internal efficiencies or what else?\nMark Mondello: I would say, if you are talking about the OI line year-on-year, boy, it\u2019s one of the best financial metrics we have in the company. I would say it starts with the composition of the team led by Fred McCoy and his whole team. The job they are doing on an execution basis is tremendous. If you think about some of the catalysts for sure, the Inflation Reduction Act overall industrial are strong. Parts of wireless infrastructure and cloud remains strong, and then, again, on the income line, I would say, it\u2019s a combination of just tremendous execution, customer care, and again, our -- the overall EMS portfolio, although, we report it in four different sectors, just has an endless number of customers and I think that diversification plays into that as well.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Excellent. Thanks very much.\nMark Mondello: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Paul Chung from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So just on the manufacturing footprint in Mexico and North America, are you seeing some increasing competition from some of the Asia competitors and any resulting price based competition there? And if you could expand on some of the competitive advantages you have here in North America, just seems some favorable growth trends? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: We always see competition. I feel without -- I don\u2019t really want to get into quantifying it. I just think -- we are a U.S. domiciled company and if there was ever a geography that I feel really, really good, again, I think, we compete really well all over the globe. I feel very good about our ability to compete in the Americas. We have always -- we have a longstanding track record in how to run, execute and offer great customer care out of Mexico and the U.S. In terms of getting into the competition of who they are it\u2019s the same competition we have all over the globe. If you are inferring that over the next coming years, maybe overall growth rates might be quite good in North America and Mexico. If you are serious on that or your inference on that is correct, we are very, very well positioned both in U.S. and Mexico.\nPaul Chung: Got you. Nice home field advantage. And then on connected devices and mobility here, are we kind of seeing a bottom here in guidance revisions and can we start to see maybe rebounding order flow as we head into second half of calendar year? Just your thoughts on those key markets and how kind of margins also evolved? Thank you.\nMark Mondello: You are welcome. For us, mobility -- if I think about FY 2022, if I think about our outlook in September and if I think about where it is today, mobility hasn\u2019t changed much, it\u2019s plus or minus $100 million on nearly a $4 billion base. So mobility is kind of turning out about how we thought it would and both on an absolute scale and a relative scale to September in FY 2022 and there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes there. Our overall consumer business, though, is we -- it\u2019s weak compared to 2022, it\u2019s weak compared to what we thought in September. Has it bottomed? Not sure. Let\u2019s see what happens. There are so many moving parts. You have seen what has happened this week in the banking industry. We will see what the interaction is both from the government, both from the Fed. So, again, the nice thing is, is our consumer business is well diversified. In terms of the sector or end market as a whole, I don\u2019t know if I would have enough insight to suggest it\u2019s bottomed or not, I would say that, we have taken a very significant hit in consumer. I think our outlook for the back half of the year is rational and with that we are taking the year up in terms of margins by 10 bps and we feel really, really good about that. And again, I think, it\u2019s illustrative of the composition of the overall company today.\nPaul Chung: Great. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Shannon Cross from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nShannon Cross: Hi. Thank you very much. Speaking of turmoil in the banking system we are still here.\nMark Mondello: Congratulations.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. Yes. To all the clients out there we are alive and kicking. So with -- just a couple of questions. On the EMS margin you attributed the improvement to scale leverage. Can you elaborate more on that and then maybe just talk about how you see scale versus mix versus cost optimization playing through as you look forward on operating margin? And I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello: Let me clarify, you are talking about the margin expansion in EMS?\nShannon Cross: Yes.\nMark Mondello: Yeah. I don\u2019t think I -- maybe I said it and maybe I forgot already, but I don\u2019t think I suggested that, it\u2019s solely around scale and leverage. It\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s mainly around the fact -- I think it\u2019s composition of the business and I think it\u2019s about the experience and the execution of. In terms of our overall company I feel this way. Our -- there\u2019s no team in the industry, in our industry that has the experience and just the overall approach that our EMS team does. So I think leadership matters, I think the team matters. I am giving you mixed thoughts, because the results are very good, but it\u2019s not like a coincidence. I think it\u2019s a combination of the leadership team. We have restructured that organization a bit. We took some costs out at the beginning of the year that Mike talked about back in December. The composition, the overall diversification, our opportunity to continue to gain share in areas that we want to gain share in. We have also made some very tough decisions on maybe some relationships that weren\u2019t performing as well. And by the way, in general, I think that, in our industry, scale gives us a huge competitive advantage for lots of different reasons and not just scale for the sake of scale, but add to that our geographic reach, our geographic knowhow and then weave into that the sophistication of our IT systems, the investments we have made on the manufacturing floor, which is hundreds of millions of dollars over the last three years or four years in automation, AI, robotics, data analytics, I think, all that plays, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, as you think about capital allocation, obviously, shareholder, sorry, share repurchase remains a key focus. How are you balancing the opportunity, say, in auto where, obviously, there\u2019s significant growth potential versus returning cash to shareholders? What\u2019s -- I know you go through probably just a returns based analysis, but how are you sort of thinking about it holistically and potential for, I don\u2019t know, small acquisitions as well?\nMark Mondello: I don\u2019t want to answer this. I think I will waive the Jabil flag a little bit. I believe, in my opinion and I have had lots and lots and lots of debates with sell-side, buy-side folks. I think from June of 2016 through today, we never get it right, we never get it perfect and we will never be exactly aligned with the sell-side, buy-side partners. But I think we have done an exceptional job with our capital allocation strategy both strategically, tactically and financially. And it is a lot of about a lot of data, a lot of data analytics and we have come at that all the time with an eye on what do we truly believe is best for the long-term health of the business and then, of course, shareholders and customers and we will continue to behave in that exact manner.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you so much.\nMark Mondello: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions from me, first, on your wireless and cloud segment, just looking for more color what you are seeing in demand there. I know you are guiding that segment down for fiscal 2023, but part of that is due to the incremental consigned inventory at your cloud customers. We are hearing, obviously, from some competitors and suppliers that, that business has been weakening and pretty lumpy. So any color there would be great?\nMark Mondello: We -- so if you think about the business and again we combine 5G wireless, infrastructure and cloud together, as you know, from what we thought it was going to be 90 days ago in December. I actually think we guided it up by, I think, roughly $100 million relative to December and we are getting back to levels that actually we thought it would be back in September. So there\u2019s pockets of that where we are seeing a little bit of weakening. Overall, though, a reminder, our 5G wireless business is very global in nature. So to the extent that there\u2019s any and I am not suggesting there is or isn\u2019t, but to the extent there\u2019s any type of pockets of weakening in North America, we are really fortunate to have that business well diversified and our overall cloud solution, cloud business today is continuing to execute and operate slightly above the plan.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the supply constraints that you are seeing in automotive, I know in previous quarters you have had supply issues across other businesses, including healthcare and some other markets. Could you comment on the availability of parts in those areas, and on the automotive side, are you getting a sense that that supply will improve over the next few quarters?\nMark Mondello: Yeah. This is a recurring topic and rightfully so because it\u2019s been awful the last 18 months. We started tapping the drum and then maybe pounding the drum as we exited the summer of 2022, moved into fall of 2023 with opinions that the supply chain would probably get better sooner relative to maybe some other projections. It also, I think, is illustrative of advantage point we have with our scale cutting across so many different end markets. That\u2019s played out to be true. And I would say, in general terms, I believe we talked about maybe during the September Investor Day, that we thought the supply chain, although, maybe not fully back to normal, would normalize by late winter, spring time of 2023 and that\u2019s shown to be true. So, all in all, as we continue to move into the summertime of calendar 2023 and into the fall we see the supply chain getting better and better.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thanks very much.\nMark Mondello: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Kenny, congratulations on the expanding responsibilities. First on the full year revenue guidance, I recognize there\u2019s no change to the overall guidance. If I look at the second half, in particular, it does imply year-over-year revenue declines especially in the EMS segment. I recognize there\u2019s a high base that\u2019s perhaps a factor. But could you double click a little bit on what\u2019s happening in the second half? How much is maybe that high base in program timing and how much might be macro factors that are contributing to that?\nMark Mondello: Mark, you are breaking up a little bit. There\u2019s some static on the line. So I am not sure I understood your question correctly. So let me offer an answer and if I miss your question, please tell me and I will do a better job trying to dial in on exactly what you are asking. So I think what I heard you ask was back half of the year in terms of revenue. So if I could break that into three buckets and if I -- again bring me back to the genesis of your question, if I missed it. If we look at the back half, our DMS revenue is down about $200 million relative to where we thought we would be in September and almost all of that is the consumer space. Our EMS revenue is within $50 million, $100 million where we thought it would be in September, so let\u2019s just say that\u2019s flat and largely as we expected. At an enterprise level, the second half is off about $150 million, $200 million, and again, that captures the consumer business as a subset. So in the most simplistic terms, that\u2019s how we look at the back half revenue wise relative to the outlook we provided in September.\nMark Delaney: That\u2019s helpful, Mark. Hopefully, you can hear me a little bit better now, I removed my headset. But I was also trying to get at whether or not you thought the declines in the second half was due to program timing and just a high base from last year or you would attribute it to macroeconomic trends?\nMark Mondello: Which declines are you speaking to?\nMark Delaney: Well, specifically in the EMS part of the business being down year-on-year. It looked like it was a tough comp. So was it kind of more program timing or would you attribute it more to macroeconomic factors?\nMark Mondello: You are talking about on a year-on-year basis?\nMark Delaney: Correct.\nMark Mondello: Okay. The vast majority of that is consignment. If you take a look at year-on-year, and again, I will round the numbers and my numbers might not be exact, but if you break it into the four sectors in which we report our business. Digital print and retail, I believe, is up year-on-year. Industrial Semi-Cap is up a lot year-on-year and that\u2019s with a week -- that\u2019s with a hopefully a temporary weak situation in Semi-Cap. Our network and storage business is up for the year. And 5G wireless and cloud is down for the year, of which all of that is consignment from a financial perspective and that sector is up in terms of unit volumes.\nMark Delaney: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nMark Mondello: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to management for any further or closing comments.\nMark Mondello: Thank you for your time today. Please reach out if you have any further questions.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Q2 marked a solid close to the first half of the fiscal year. Through the first two quarters of FY 2023, the team delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, core operating income and core earnings per share, while also expanding core margins by 20 basis points compared to the first half of FY 2022. Growth year-to-date has been headlined by areas of our businesses experiencing long-term secular growth trends, offset slightly by some of our more consumer centric markets and Semi-Cap. The team's impressive performance through the first half of our fiscal year, despite what continues to be an extremely dynamic macroeconomic environment underscores the strength of our diversified portfolio and the improved resiliency of our business. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q2 beginning with inventory, which came in higher than expected mainly due to timing and continued component constraints on the automotive supply chain. The team did a good job offsetting a portion of our inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers. Net of these deposits, inventory days was 69 in Q2. We continue to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY 2023 and beyond, targeting net inventory days ranging between 60 days to 65 days in the medium-term and expecting to normalize in the 55 days to 60 days range in the long-term. Our second quarter cash flows from operations came in at $414 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $304 million. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.2 billion and a total debt to core EBITDA level of approximately 1.1. Turning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide, we expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue will both be $4.1 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $363 million to $423 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $336 million to $396 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.90. Net interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately $80 million and for the year to be in the range of $295 million to $300 million, which is higher than we forecasted in December, due to more conservative interest rate and working capital assumptions. As inventory levels normalize, I expect these interest costs to gradually decrease over the mid- to long-term. Tax rate on core earnings in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 19%. Moving to the next slide, where I will offer an update on the end market demand assumptions and how these translate to our FY 2023 revenue expectations. At a high level, our year so far is playing out consistent with our assumptions in December. The industry continues to benefit from outsourcing of manufacturing as a macro trend due to dynamics such as onshoring closer to end consumers, complex supply chain dynamics and greater content due to ever increasing design complexities and products. We continue to expect areas of our businesses benefiting from strong long-term secular growth trends like electric vehicles, healthcare, renewable energy infrastructure, 5G and cloud to drive solid year-over-year growth. An area where our outlook has improved since December is in our industrial business where we see robust demand for renewable energy infrastructure, which we expect to drive double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Electric vehicle demand also continues to remain extremely strong as we continue to gain share in an end market with strong robust growth as we navigate product manufacturing life cycles and ramps at different stages in their maturity curves, constrained by a tight component supply chain. We expect a portion of the solid growth from our secular markets to be offset by lower demand in our consumer-facing markets and in Semi-Cap. In summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect the secular demand across many of our end markets to remain strong. Considering this updated demand picture, let's now turn to the next slide to get a view of our updated guidance for FY 2023. We expect our improved mix of business will drive incremental operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margins by 10 basis points to 4.9% for FY 2023 on revenue of $34.5 billion. We continue to anticipate core EPS will be $8.40, which is reflective of our improved core operating income, offset by higher interest expense. Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating an excess of $900 million in free cash flow. Overall, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year and drive the company to core margins beyond 5%. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Kenny. Yeah. Thanks. So, if you look at EBIT. EBIT has grown from December by about $25 million, but on the other side of the coin, interest costs have gone up as well, our business -- our operating business, our secular trends, all the end markets that we perform in, that's actually going really well. Performance is stronger than we have anticipated. So we have taken EBIT up. Unfortunately, we have had a slightly higher level of inventory, mainly due to couple of reasons. There's timing where inventory came in at the end of the quarter. The opposite side of that shows up in AP. So I am not that worried about that piece. But the auto supply chain continues to be tight. We sort of anticipated it improving over the quarter and the rest of the year. We are not seeing that. So it's not getting worse, but it's not getting any better either. So there's inventory and then on the interest side, obviously, the short end of the interest rate curve has steepened over the last 10 weeks, 12 weeks, notwithstanding the last three days or four days. The short-term borrowings that we have to finance our working capital has gone up as well. So it's a little bit of a positive story and that our underlying business is performing really well. We are having some level of temporary issues with inventory and interest rates. If you look at the other side of that, when we come out of this at some point in time over the next three quarters, four quarters, interest rates, interest costs, everything should subside at our inventory levels should be much better as well. So right now, our inventory is in that 68 days, 69 days sort of the net inventory that we have announced. The expectation is for it to be in the 60 days, 65 days in the medium-term and I actually expect it to go down to 55 days, 60 days in the long-term as well. So, plenty of positive momentum to come at some point in the future as well, Ruplu."

            "name": "Kenny Wilson",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I am pleased to be joining the call today. It is truly humbling to reflect back 23 years to when I joined Jabil in our manufacturing facility in Livingston, Scotland. Since then I have been afforded the opportunity to grow and lead several areas of our business. Most recently, I had the privilege to live and work in Asia, leading our Jabil Green Point organization, which has played a major role in building out multiple key capabilities that continue to be leverage across the company. Going forward, I am excited to lead Jabil as CEO, alongside a team of extremely talented and long tenured industry leaders. I would like to share a few thoughts on what you should expect from us going forward. As Mark mentioned 90 days ago, think of this as evolutionary, not revolutionary, it is our term to carry the torch and prepare our organization for future growth. First, we have a customer-centric organization, always have been, always will be. As such, we will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers and shareholders to deliver long-term value. Second, we will continue to cultivate our unique culture, which attracts, retains, empowers and enables our people, allowing their true self to turn up to work every day. Third, we will remain focused on increasing margins and delivering sustainable free cash flow through a combination of enhancing the mix of our business and excellent operational execution. It's my belief that this in turn will allow us to earn an appropriate return on investment for the value we provide. Moving on to our business, today we see incredible tailwinds driving our business forward. For instance, this year, we are seeing robust growth in our industrial business in areas like renewable energy generation and storage. In automotive, the team continues to navigate multiple complex program introductions, increasing both our scale and addressable content per vehicle. And in healthcare, we continue to win new business in areas such as digital health and precision medicine as the industry outsource trend accelerates. The success we are seeing in these areas is a key proof point of our team's ability to leverage multiple capabilities across fiscal end markets as we continue to diversify our service offerings. Moving on to the year, I am pleased with the momentum underway in the business. We expect good growth and operating leverage, which gives us the confidence to raise our expectations for core margins to 4.9% for fiscal 2023. At the same time, we remain highly focused on delivering more than $900 million in free cash flow and when I think about Jabil beyond fiscal year 2023, there is a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead. Between the mix of business and the growth trends underpinned by our long tenured management team, I am confident that we can drive the company at above 5% core margins with sustainable strong cash flows. This will afford us tremendous flexibility in our capital allocation. In the coming years, we will remain focused on executing buybacks when they produce strong returns for shareholders and remain committed to a dividend. As it relates to M&A, you will see us continue to focus on capability building deals consistent with the past several years. And finally, we will ensure our capital structure is optimized and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. In closing, I feel it is appropriate to send a message to our people here at Jabil. I have spent over 20 years at our company and I am excited to be a leader. I will strive to make you proud. At Jabil, our people are our greatest asset. Our strength is in our ability to bring together a collection of people from diverse backgrounds, different experiences and multiple generations and moved into a culture that across the world is both consistent and a true differentiator. Being no doubt that all that matters every day is that you give away your best, focus on performance and strive to be the leader or coworker you wish you had. In summary, bring your true self to work each and every day without anxiety or fear of recourse. I am truly grateful to each and every one of you for all that you do. I will now turn the call over to Adam. Yeah. Thanks for the message, Ruplu. I really appreciate it. Yeah. So, as you know, the EMS, the automotive industry when you do automotive business, you have got to be -- it takes you a while to get qualified. The programs run for five years, six years, seven years. You also got to be able to leverage that capability consistently in multiple geographies across the world. So that kind of plays to our strength and we see that -- for sure we think there's enough opportunity and enough heeding for multiple different suppliers or competitors. So, yes, we are pretty confident that, we have got a value proposition that's going to see us continue to grow our business in automotive in the longer term. In terms of -- in the EV space, if we look at our total automotive business, it's in the order of 80% to 90% of our business now is kind of EV and autonomous. So I think you should expect -- we are pretty confident that basically we are well positioned. We have got business with most of the large OEMs and we are very, very confident that's going to grow and continue across multiple geographies in the future."

I would now like to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's first quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call. Joining me on today's call is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety will be posted for audio playback on our website. I'd now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected second quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our solid quarter. To kick off the fiscal year, the team delivered approximately $9.6 billion in revenue, well ahead of our forecast and at the top end of our guidance range, driven by even better-than-expected revenue in automotive, healthcare and industrial. All other end markets largely performed consistent to our expectations from 90 days ago. When you put all of this together, at the enterprise level, revenue grew by 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Core operating income during the quarter was $461 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.8%. This is up 10 basis points over the prior year and in line with expectations. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $362 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61. Net interest expense in the quarter came in higher than expectations at $66 million as the combination of higher interest rates and better-than-expected demand drove our working capital needs higher during the quarter. During the quarter, we also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $161 million. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.31, a 20% improvement over the prior year quarter and at the higher end of our range as core operating income grew much faster than net interest expense. Now turning to the segments. Revenue for the DMS segment was $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis and ahead of our plan from September, while core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.2%, slightly below expectations as upside strength in automotive and healthcare was offset by operational inefficiencies associated with mobility in China. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.5 billion, an increase of 18% on a year-over-year basis, while core margins for the segment was 4.3%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting solid operational execution on strong revenue growth. So in summary, another strong quarter is in the books for Jabil. And I know the team here is extremely proud of the strides we've made to not only improve our business over the last 10 years but also make it stronger and more resilient. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Mark and Mike to provide some additional thoughts on our performance in the quarter and update our outlook for fiscal '23. And I think you'll see there's still so much opportunity as we move into fiscal '23 and beyond. Thanks for your time today. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor : Thanks, Adam. As Adam just detailed, our performance in Q1 was quite strong. I continue to be extremely pleased with the strength of our business, which delivered double-digit growth in revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in the quarter. Our diversified portfolio and continued participation in end markets with long-term secular trends was once again reflected in our Q1 performance.  I'd now like to walk you through our balance sheet and cash flow performance in the quarter. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $166 million and net capital expenditures totaled $164 million. As a reminder, our customers routinely co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then later reimbursed to us by customers. Due to the high dollar value of these co-investments from our customers and how they are reflected on our cash flow statement, it is important to net the two line items shown on the slide to reflect the true CapEx number and what we refer to as net capital expenditures.  For the quarter, inventory days came in at 78, down 1 day sequentially on improved working capital management by the team. As a reminder, we offset a portion of our inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers. Net of these deposits, inventory days were 61 in Q1, also down 1 day from Q4. We continue to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY '23 as some of the supply chain constraints continue to improve.  We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x on cash balances of $1.2 billion. Turning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '23 to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.4 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $4.1 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $347 million to $407 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $319 million to $379 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.64 to $2.04. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.84. Interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately $67 million and for the year to be in the range of $265 million to $270 million, which is higher than we forecasted in September due to more conservative interest rate and working capital assumptions. The tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 19%. Moving to the next slide, where I'll offer an update on the end market demand assumptions that we noted in September. As a reminder, our FY '23 guidance assumed a moderate economic slowdown and some moderation in growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Based on what we know today, our assumptions from a demand perspective remain largely consistent. Across many of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient, particularly in areas that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds like electric vehicles, healthcare, renewable energy infrastructure 5G and cloud. We continue to expect these secular markets to expand in the pace of an economic slowdown. At the same time, we also continue to expect some consumer-centric end markets to underperform year-on-year consistent with our thoughts in September. All together, we still expect good growth in FY '23, as you'll see detailed on the next slide. Starting with our automotive business, which continues to outperform despite global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates. We've seen this rapid acceleration manifest in FY '23 automotive revenue growth expected to be in excess of 40% year-on-year. We're also expecting double-digit year-over-year growth in our healthcare business, which continues to benefit from an outsourcing of manufacturing trend and has historically been recession resistant with long product life cycles accretive margins and stable cash flows. Further, our industrial business is also expected to expand by double digits this year, fueled by growth in clean and smart energy infrastructure as government legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. accelerates investment in the space. And in 5G wireless, we continue to expect solid year-on-year growth. Infrastructure rollouts are accelerating, and our localized manufacturing capabilities are leading to growth in other geos such as India. We expect these rollouts to play out over the next several years regardless of near-term economic conditions.  Within our cloud business in September, we detailed our plan to shift certain components we procure and integrate from a purchase and resale model to a customer control consignment service model. This transition, in fact, began in November, which is earlier than our expectations 90 days ago. As a result, revenue would be lower than previously expected as an incremental $300 million of components was shipped to the new model. This is in addition to the $500 million of consignment impact we announced in September. Adjusting for this shift, we expect continued robust unit growth in the cloud space in FY '23 and beyond. In summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand across many of our end markets to remain strong with year-over-year revenue growth at an enterprise level to be approximately 3% for FY '23 despite an assumed economic slowdown in the second half of the fiscal year. Now turning to the next slide. We have intentionally structured our business with the aim of delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth, strong predictable cash flows and shareholder returns. With that in mind, while we continue to expect growth in our business despite recessionary headwinds, we have identified certain cost savings mainly in our SG&A and support organization for the second half of our fiscal year as we continue to look at doing more with less. And noncore expenses associated with our optimization activities will be approximately $45 million, with the benefits expected in the back half of the fiscal year. We anticipate these costs will result in a net benefit to core earnings per share of approximately $0.10 in FY '23 and $0.20 in FY '24. This benefit has been considered in our updated core EPS outlook for FY '23 of $8.40. We expect the cash outlay associated with our optimization efforts to be incurred over the next two quarters, and we continue to expect free cash flow of more than $900 million in the fiscal year. We expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment and feel the steps we've taken to optimize our business are appropriate and make us stronger. I would like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Mondello: Thanks, Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to our team here at Jabil. Thank you for your attention to detail, and thank you for the way you care for and accept one another. Your attitude is amazing, and your dedication is incredible.  With that, let's move to our next slide. It's staggering when I think about what our team has built and tailored over the past five to six years. A large-scale portfolio of business sectors, eight discrete yet interwoven sectors, which offer Jabil a high degree of resiliency during times of macro and geopolitical disruption as well as gearing times when we simply welcome the ongoing demands placed on us by our customers. IN looking at this slide, I think about a world where countless products and a massive number of supply chains need to be created, redesigned or modified, therefore placing Jabil deep in the heart of essential end markets. Before moving to our next slide, it's worth revisiting the topic that we addressed during our Investor Day event back in September, the topic being the intentional output of the portfolio you see in front of you with the intention being that no single product contributes more than 5% to Jabil's overall earnings. This result is a good thing. It's a really good thing, especially when we think about dependability and sustainability. It also shines a bright light on the strategic importance of diversification and scale and the clear impact it has when operating our business. In recognizing our Q1 results, along with our 2Q guide as detailed by Adam and Mike, combined with a watchful eye on the back half of the year, we find ourselves with an updated financial plan for FY '23, an outlook which has us increasing core earnings per share to $8.40, an increase of $0.25 from our forecast roughly 90 days ago. In addition, we believe that core operating margin will hold at 4.8% for the year on revenue of roughly $34.5 billion, while free cash flow remains north of $900 million. Integral to this outlook is the fact that our team is doing an exceptional job of proactively managing costs and controlling what they can control in today's environment. Moving to our next slide. I'll share thoughts on our path forward. Shown here are fundamental catalysts, which are key to favorable results and future outcomes for Jabil: The unique combination of our approach, structure and experience, our ability to execute, combined with our engineering expertise, financial plans that are grounded in rational assumptions and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. And rounding on our path forward, maybe it makes sense to step back a bit and think about the past few years. The data suggests that what we're doing is working, a testament of just how well our team is managing the business I'd now like to transition from our path to our purpose. Here at Jabil, we're never confused about our obligation to deliver a fair return to shareholders. With this obligation well understood, and considering the upcoming holiday season, we're taking a little extra time to heighten our focus on ensuring a meaningful purpose in all we do. We're encouraging our employees to take a deep breath and a short pause, creating a little time for reflection, reflect on our team, reflect on their personal lives and reflect on giving back to those in need. And speaking a reflection, when it comes to helping those in need, I'm proud to report that our employees around the world just surpassed 1 million hours of personal volunteer time for calendar 2022. What a positive difference created for so many around the world, so many who need it most. Our team's effort was extraordinary. And in multiple ways, their effort was life-changing. Here at Jabil, we fully embraced the meaning and importance of carrying a purpose, both at home and in the workplace. And we do so with exceptional conduct and care. I'm just so honored to serve such a strong and steady team. Their approach is responsible and reliable. They value the relationships we have with all of those that we serve. Each day, we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. And in doing so, Jabil is making the world just a little bit better. In closing, to all of you here at Jabil, please know that you can be your true self without anxiety or fear recourse each day when you come to work. And to everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday season.  With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: Two questions, if I could, please. First, on inventories, Mike. A little bit of improvement there quarter-over-quarter and it looks like you were able to get more components on the auto side. I wonder how close we are to just sort of calling spring in terms of normalizing inventories during the course of the next 12 months. And then I had a follow-up.\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Steve. Yes, so the inventory days that we just printed 61 days, down 1 day from Q4. A normalized run rate, Steve, would be around that 55, 57. That's what I expect. Not anytime soon, but that is the ultimate sort of aim. I do expect that 61 days to continue to go down to that 58, 59 level. There will be quarterly nuances, timing nuances, et cetera. But overall, the trend would be in the downward direction, particularly with the supply chain constraints easing, as you mentioned.\nSteven Fox : That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more of some of the stuff you're doing on the energy infrastructure side. It seems to be supporting some good growth in industrial from the standpoint of how the new program backlog looks, what your right to play in those markets, whether it's increasing and where you're seeing production interest.\nMark Mondello : Steve, that's an area of our business. As you know, it's embedded in our industrial business. We don't tend to break out all the individual products. But in terms of overall energy management, clean energy, et cetera, that's an area where, if you take a look at our overall industrial growth, I would say that the growth rate of that component of our industrial business is greater than most of the other industrial business. So whether it be solar, whether it be off-grid battery storage, whether it be new efficiency of off-grid power generation, mobile power generation, it's an area that's, from a strategy standpoint, very important in the next three to four years of the overall industrial business. I'd equate it -- I don't know that the growth will be as secular as maybe EVs. But five, six years ago, when we made decisions to go hard into the EV market and move a lot of our resources that way, you could think of it a bit the same in terms of our overall industrial business. That part of our industrial business is getting a lot of attention.\nSteven Fox : Any skill set you would point out as to why you guys are winning in that segment in particular?\nMark Mondello : Yes. You're welcome. I guess I'd make a general statement and a specific statement. I think one of the interesting characteristics of Jabil is to be really effective in this business over the long term, I think scale matters. And then in one of the slides that we just indexed through, if you look at the overall portfolio today that make up the $34 billion, $35 billion of revenue, the balance of the portfolio is substantial.  And so again, coming back to your specific question, when I think about the markets that you're referring to, A, we've got a whole set of engineering staff that are, let's just say, expert in that area. But much like all of our businesses, they also have a vast pool of engineering resources in other sectors that they also get to confer with and talk to and think about being creative in terms of overall solutions in the industrial space. And I think that makes a big difference.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.\nJim Suva : You mentioned a little bit of manufacturing challenges with the DMS segment. I assume that has to do with the COVID closures and things. Can you just update us as we sit here now around December 15? Have those kind of been back to normalized? Are there still inefficiencies going on? Or any changes in how we should think about those efficiencies and inefficiencies?\nMark Mondello : Hey, Jim. I think for the quarter, so if we backward look to September, October, November with the kind of zero COVID policy, everything that was in the media around China and then kind of our exposure to that and our experience with that, in very round numbers, I would say that the kind of overall China COVID activities probably impacted Q1 by about $10 million, give or take. As you've seen recently, and maybe you're referring to this with some recent changes around the zero COVID policy, we'll continue to manage that in much the same way, being very careful, practical, thoughtful in terms of managing China coming out of a zero COVID policy. We've been doing that around the world since January of 2020. I think our protocols around the world and in China are kind of best-in-class. And I think protocols and processes aside, Jim, I give a huge amount of credit to our leadership team and our supervisors on the ground in China. We have a fabulous relationship with our people and our employees, and that in and of itself makes a huge difference. So anyway, that's our intent.\nJim Suva : And then as a follow-up on a different topic, you mentioned some more consigning. That was kind of the same customer? Or is it expanding more or the relationship getting deeper? Or is it kind of getting broader for the consignment? I'm just kind of curious, it seems like to me, I should think about the consignment as a good thing for like more sticky business and sticky relationships.\nMark Mondello : Yes. I'm not going to get into customer-specific. I think when it comes to parts of our cloud business, Jim, we've been very, very consistent. And I don't know the first time we came out on a call and started talking about our entry into the cloud business based on our right to play and the solutions that our team wanted to bring forward. But what we talked about maybe back in 2018 and through 2019 and even through 2020 and COVID and on and on and on, we've been extremely consistent with the fact that our value proposition in that area of our business is very geocentric and very asset-light. And said differently, we do a very good job of aligning variable costs with the puts and takes of the revenue. This is nothing more than that continuing. And the team has done an absolutely fantastic job of growing that business. I think on one of the slides again that we showed, you can see our cloud business or let's just say, cloud and 5G is now $6 billion, give or take. So I think that's a proxy for how successful they've been. And again, we'll continue, and our intent is to continue to run that an asset-light way.\nMike Dastoor: And Jim, if I could just add, I think when we gave guidance in September, our assumption was that the consignment would start sometime in March. We actually managed to get it done far earlier in November. So you're seeing an earlier impact of this consignment piece showing up in our -- a little bit in Q1 but mainly in Q2.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross : I wanted to understand a little bit more about the decision to reduce costs. I understand there's continued productivity improvements that you can do. But I'm wondering sort of what you saw out there that led you to do this? And how much of it is proactive versus changes you've already seen in customer behavior? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Mondello : I think it's a natural decision. We -- the world is, I don't know if I use the word difficult, but let's just, for lack of a better word, things are a bit choppy right now, a little bit difficult. And whether it's running our business in each sector of our business, in a different way based on what customers need, whether it's our execution, whether it's overall cost management, I think when we sat here in August, September, and we're taking a hard look at the year. Our belief is that we should be maybe a bit more cautious to the back half of the year as we sit today.  So Mike and I got together with our leadership team, and I'm really pleased with the outcome. And by the way, this was a hard press by the overall team. We're just being proactive in terms of largely in terms of overhead costs and maybe costs that sit on top of the factories. I think that Mike said in his prepared remarks. And I think one thing I think it's worth differentiating, being proactive in the methods in the way we're being proactive in terms of cost management is, to me, way different than say writing off or writing down assets. It's really about taking a look at the business, being aggressive and proactive and then being sure that shareholders get a very fair return on that in short order. And I think Mike in his prepared remarks somewhere said on our cost management and the charge we took in the quarter, investors will get about a dime back at the back half of this year. But more importantly is, is I think the payback for '24 and into perpetuity will be $0.20, $0.25. So I think it's good use of our effort and nice returns for shareholders.\nMike Dastoor: And Shannon, our business assumptions continue to be extremely robust. I think I highlighted some of the secular trends that we're actually participating in. All of those continue to show very decent growth. \nShannon Cross : And then just one other question. How -- when you talk to your customers, how are they thinking about geographic distribution of manufacturing these days? Given the challenges in China, I know it's starting to open up again, but obviously, it comes and goes, I'm wondering how much of a discussion customers are having about Eastern Europe and India. And obviously, you're pretty well positioned to help them as they move production around. Thank you and happy holidays to all of you as well.\nMark Mondello : Thank you. Happy holidays to you too. I don't know that there's a general theme. I think we have 400-plus customers, and I think our customers' thoughts are all over the map, and they're doing the best for their business based on their products. Everything -- and this will give you a little bit of a feel for the complexity of it. And by the way, it's why our structure is so efficient and so optimal in terms of customer solutions.  Here at Jabil, we don't run our business on a factory basis. We run it customer by customer, line item by line item. And the reason we do that is let's just take a product that, let's say, the unit cost is x, but the ability to move that product around the world in terms of distributing the product is very expensive. Well, that would suggest maybe we build it in-region. We have other products that cost y and moving that product around the world is very small relative to the cost of the product, and we might consolidate that to a single spot in the world. Then you add to it, all the different geopolitical issues, the very unfortunate issue that continues to wane on in the Ukraine. So it's hard for me to go, geez, this is kind of the herd mentality of our customers because the business just doesn't act that way. Also, I would suggest that when you look at our portfolio, and you look at the eight sectors that we define and then you think about all the subsectors of the business, Again, one of the things I think is a huge strength at Jabil is the diversification. And with that diversification becomes endless amounts of solutions. And again, I take you back to our approach and our structure. We kind of work with each customer in a very unique way, accommodating their needs. With that being said, I would say that you'll probably see us do some expansion in Eastern Europe. You'll probably see us continue to expand in Mexico. I think we feel pretty good about our footprint in China. And you'll probably see some expansion over the next couple of years in India.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin : I have a question, Mark, regarding your updated revenue guidance for FY '23. You're raising the outlook for auto and healthcare. Is that related to just better supply conditions or demand related? Why taking that number up -- taking those numbers up?\nMark Mondello: We're taking them up because we can. I mean, as we sit here today, one could look at it and go, why would you guys take the numbers up, if you're somewhat cautious about the back half of the year or gosh knows what's going to happen in '23 based on what the U.S. Fed is doing in the markets, et cetera, et cetera. But I think we use very good judgment. Again, a real good charm about Jabil is we break our business up into really, really, really small pieces. And it gives us really good acuity, high resolution of all elements of our business. So in a more general sense, I think the -- again, referring back to one of the slides that one of us spoke to is we're -- as we sit today, we're going to -- we think we'll see double-digit growth in the areas of auto and transportation largely driven by EVs. Healthcare, I think we showed on the slide would be maybe north of 10%, and then same with our industrial semi cap business largely being led on the industrial side. And the growth in all three of those areas, A, supply chain is getting better and getting better faster. One caveat there is, is legacy semiconductors in the EV space are still tight. But supply chain is getting markedly better. Our ability to gather parts relative to others is very strong. And then in certain aspects of those, based on certain trends, demand is holding reasonably well.\nMatt Sheerin : And then a question, Mike, regarding the incremental consignment revenue that you talked about. So total $800 million in revenue going to consignment for your cloud customer. Does that move the needle on gross margin at all? Is there any change in terms of the operating margin or operating income on that business?\nMike Dastoor: So yes, it does move the needle a little bit on margin, but there's been some offsets. I think Adam highlighted some inefficiencies that we had on the mobility side in China, particularly in Q1. We've made some assumptions around further COVID, et cetera, as well in parts of the world, and that does have a little bit of an impact on margin. But you're right, on the consigned side, it has a small margin improvement impact. And that's one of the reasons we pursue this with -- along with the customer.\nMark Mondello : If I could add to that, here's a real simple way to think about it in very round numbers. Two years ago, the overall op margin for the company was 4.2%. Last year, it was 4.6%. This year, at the beginning of the year, we suggested that the op margin for the year will be 4.8%. We're holding to that 4.8%, which we're proud of. So there's a 20 bps expansion between '22 and '23. About half of that is based on our cost management for the back half of the year as well as continuing to advance our asset-light nature of our cloud business and the other half of that is the lack of a better word, the core business. But what's interesting is, I don't even like differentiating that because for me, all of this activity goes hand in hand with running a good business. So -- but in terms of your modeling and the way to think about it, I think that's a reasonable way to think about it.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya : My first question is on the DMS segment. Mark, you're seeing strong growth in automotive and healthcare, and you've taken up those two segments combined by $600 million for the full year. Like you said, the consumer-facing end markets in that segment are weaker, and you're taking that down by 200 basis points. Net when I look at operating margin, it's down 10 bps. So my question to you is if the consumer-facing end markets get weaker, can you talk us through your thoughts on margin risk in DMS? I mean, how -- do you think margins can go lower in that segment? Or what offsets do you have -- and typically, the reason I'm asking this is because typically one would think automotive and healthcare to be higher-margin end markets. So if you're seeing a mix shift into that, what's driving the 10 basis points lower? And how do you see risk to that if the consumer-facing markets go lower?\nMark Mondello : Ruplu, that's a little bit of an open-ended question because I don't know if you mean it this way, but I'll answer it how I understand it, which is if the bottom falls out of all consumer-facing products, could the overall DMS margins go down further? Maybe. As we sit today, I think we've done a reasonably good job of for what we know, handicapping the back half of the year. And you -- the way you stated it is largely correct. We've really kind of haircut and handicap any consumer-facing products. And again, the reciprocal of that is we feel good about industrial, automotive and healthcare. If you -- as you're putting your model together for the year, we just reported first quarter -- we just gave you a hard guide on 2Q. As I think about Q3 and Q4, our DMS margins, as you start putting numbers together and do your after calls and whatnot, I think what you'll find is doing the math is to have our DMS business end up being at 5% or 5.1% margin. Whatever it ends up being, Q4 is going to end up being a pretty strong quarter. And I think that's reflective of exactly what you said, which is some of the higher margins in auto and healthcare. I would also -- why we're on the topic of the year is, let's not be -- let's be sure it's not lost on us, the hard work and the complementary work that our EMS team is doing in terms of their business and margins for the year as well. When we went into 1Q, on the EMS side, we thought margins would be in the 4%, 4.1% range, that came in 4.3%. If you take a look at our guide and do your math on that, you'll see the strong margins returns in 2Q. And then if you think about the year on the EMS side, last year, I don't remember the exact number, but EMS was 4.2%, 4.3%. Beginning of the year, we thought EMS would be -- for the year, EMS would be around 4.4%, 4.5%. And I think EMS is going to come in closer to 4.6%, 4.7%. So again, let's step back and just have an appreciation for the fact that the business is kind of an entire portfolio. And I say that respectfully I understand your question was around DMS. I hope that helps.\nRuplu Bhattacharya : For my second question, if I can ask, Mike, 4.8% operating margin total for the company. Can you help us quantify the inflation pass-through impact on that? I'm assuming like other EMS companies as component costs have gone up, you're passing that through. I'm not sure if it's a dollar for dollar, but if it is, then your revenue should be hurting -- but sorry, your margin should be hurting because of that. And so what would that 4.8% have been if there was no inflation pass-through? And when we think about modeling margins, if we look back, the Slide 13 that you have, you've kind of shown us the last five years and how the margins have progressed since fiscal '19, very strong performance. But I mean, as we model out going forward, what are the puts and takes here? Like I mean you're going to get a benefit as inflation goes down. That should help margins. But what are the other things that can drive margins? And any guidance you can give to -- how do you think about what the target margins can be in the long term?\nMark Mondello : Ruplu, I'll intercept that one for a minute. Wow, that was a lot. Let me bring you back to what I think was the first part of the question, which is, yes, you're correct. In the first quarter, at an enterprise level, margins were 4.8%. I kind of think you answered your own question, which is 1Q of last year, margins were 4.7%. We thought that the first quarter would come in back in August, September, we were guiding and anticipating the margins for Q1 would be 4.8%. They came in right on top of the 4.8%. Again, I'll bring you back to DMS margins were down about 20 basis points. EMS margins were up 20 basis points, again, indication of the size, scale, but again, the wonderful diversification we have.  If we didn't have good understandings with our customers in terms of equitable sharing when variable costs go up and down, we wouldn't have delivered the 4.8%. So I don't say that to drive a concern. I say that much in an opposite way, which is the way we have our business set up, the way we have our customer relationship set up are very satisfactory to our leadership team. In terms of what else could have impacts on the overall margins for the year, it could be anything. On the downside, it could be that -- the macro gets worse on the -- so what do I worry about? Yes, the macro could collapse is that in the other, but then that instability will be there for everybody. What I don't worry about is, I don't worry about our team's ability to execute. I don't worry about our team in and of itself. I love the portfolio that we have. I don't worry about the size of the market. I don't worry about our ability to continue to gain share. And maybe you wrap all that up I think our team, both at a factory level and above factory does a really, really nice job of controlling what we can control.\nRuplu Bhattacharya : Got it. I mean I really appreciate all those details. And wondering, maybe now if I can sneak one more quick one in. I know you've announced Kenny Wilson to be the new CEO effective May 1, and you're going to take on more of a strategy, corporate development role. So can you just talk about from now until then, what are some of the handover activities you're going to do? And should we think of any change in direction to the company? Or how should we think about this transition? Congrats again on the quarter.\nMark Mondello : Well, that's an interesting question. I've been at this a long time, and I'd make this comment not directly around my relationship with Kenny. Whether my relationships with Kenny or Borges or Dastoor or McCoy or JJ or all the folks that you've met, we have a significantly tight-knit group. We've all been at this a long time. Sometimes that becomes problematic because it feels sometimes like we've complete each other's sentences. So we've got to continue to challenge ourselves so we don't have a group think. But Kenny has been with us a long time, so has the balance of the team. I don't envision any of this being revolutionary. I think it will be evolutionary. We also added some other new leadership to the team recently with LaShawne and Kristine in legal. So I think we'll carry on. With that being said, as I continue to move more and more throughout the year into an active Chairman role, and you're right, I'll have my hands firmly involved with investors and our foundation and strategy and other stuff, I hope the team takes my 10 or 11 years and is disruptive in a positive sense. I think one of the things that this team has done over and over and over and over, and time and time again over 30 years is I think we're proactive. I think we change when we need to change. We don't change for the sake of changing. And I'd say, Kenny and some of the expanded leadership team is probably, in some sense, a little bit more edgy than I can be. And I think that's a good thing. So I think there'll be I think there'll be some good changes. You can think of them as evolutionary, not revolutionary changes because the foundation we've built for this business has never been stronger. And I'm really, really, really looking forward to the next two, three, four years to see how things shake out.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Paul Chung with JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung : So just on cash flow, you've typically seen more cash investments in 1Q, but you actually squeezed out some free cash flow this quarter. So is this more about timing or maybe less need for working capital investments kind of given elevated build last year? And any comments there in the kind of the shape of free cash flow for the year? And then also on guidance, it remains unchanged. So how are you kind of offsetting the increase in interest expense and kind of cash outlays on optimization? Or was that kind of included in your projections last quarter?\nMike Dastoor: Yes. So the free cash flow assumptions that we have today that reflect everything reflect they reflect the sort of charge that we've taken, the cash outlay associated with that. Don't forget that the savings on the other side of that as well. So there is definitely everything that's out there is reflected in the free cash flow. From a Q1 standpoint, I think it's more timing. We've talked about our CapEx being in that 2.5% range. Not much changes from that 2.5% guidance that we provided in September. You'll always have timing differences. You'll have nuances. From a shape of the year perspective, I sort of -- I\u2019d just use shapes from previous years. I think it will be very similar to that. Obviously, timing moves things here and there a little bit. But overall, we still feel committed to our $900 million free cash flow number for the year as well.\nPaul Chung : Got you. And then just a follow-up on op margins, seem very kind of good progression here over the last two years, some nice benefits from cloud consignment. But can you expand on the drivers to get to that 5% mark and kind of the pace beyond fiscal year '23? You're doing some cost optimization here, but will it be more a function of mix kind of efficiencies or even scale as you guys are approaching $10 billion in quarterly revenue run rate now.\nMike Dastoor: I would suggest all of you about, Paul, I think it's definitely a mix, operational efficiency, something we always execute on. We've always invested in the past around automation, robotics, et cetera. So we feel good about that as well. And overall, the margin, does it go beyond 5%, 5.5% as well. We're not stopping at 4.8%, and we're definitely not stopping it at 5% either. So it's something we're actively engaged in and feel very strongly about. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt : I have a big picture macro question on sort of demand. And you talked about your demand characteristics being relatively consistent with 90 days ago. But I'm trying to square it with your commentary being a little bit more cautious as we move through the back half of this year. I guess my question is when you think about what's happening in the marketplace, we're seeing some intensity drop from a capital spend in telcos and cloud. How much of your demand visibility or your revenue visibility has to do with elevated backlogs because supply chain has been sort of elevated for quite some time versus the in-period demand that you're seeing today from your customers? And then I have another question.\nMark Mondello : David, well first off, welcome to the group. I think you just started coverage on us, and we look forward to spending more time with you so you can better understand the business. In terms of your questions, there's pent-up demand, but I would caveat answering your question similar to a prior question, which is I don't want to make a blanket statement because, as an example, let's take networking or, say, legacy telco. That part of our business today is about $3 billion on a $35 billion base. So in terms of what type of backlog we see from the telco folks or the networking folks, I guess it's relevant. But in terms of our overall corporate results, I'm not sure how impactful that might be. I think a 100% we have seen pent-up demand and backlog across almost every single area of our business where supply chain constraints existed. If I could paint it with a broad brush and take this with a degree of inaccuracy, I guess, because I'm trying to paint it with a broad brush across a large-scale portfolio, I think that most of the pent-up demand and the backlog, in general, will probably be alleviated by late 1Q of '23 or into the second quarter of '23, to say the first half of '23. So I think most of the pockets of backlog clear and normalized as we get back -- as we get to the back half of calendar '23. Again, I don't know if that's helpful or not, but that's kind of a general statement as we look across the business.\nDavid Vogt : No, that's helpful. What we're trying to kind of understand is sort of the normal cadence of sort of order trajectory of the business, stripping aside what we've kind of lived through the last couple of years. So that's helpful. We appreciate it. And then maybe just a final question on cash flow and capital priorities. You've done a great job in terms of returning shareholder capital and managing cash flow over the last couple of years. Does your commentary about the second half or maybe some of the cash used for the restructuring change any of your priorities in the balance of this year. I wouldn't think so, but just wanted to just confirm with you.\nMike Dastoor: No, there's no change to our capital allocation. We've talked about in September, we have another $1.1 billion left of our authorization. We continue to use it. We use quite a bit of that in Q1, and we'll be doing in the range of 150, 200-plus type of buybacks every quarter. So nothing that happens in the second half for -- also that, that actually be an opportunity to do some more in fact, if things start going south.\nMark Mondello : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. With that, this does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day, and happy holidays.",

            "name": "Mark Mondello",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to our team here at Jabil. Thank you for your attention to detail, and thank you for the way you care for and accept one another. Your attitude is amazing, and your dedication is incredible.  With that, let's move to our next slide. It's staggering when I think about what our team has built and tailored over the past five to six years. A large-scale portfolio of business sectors, eight discrete yet interwoven sectors, which offer Jabil a high degree of resiliency during times of macro and geopolitical disruption as well as gearing times when we simply welcome the ongoing demands placed on us by our customers. IN looking at this slide, I think about a world where countless products and a massive number of supply chains need to be created, redesigned or modified, therefore placing Jabil deep in the heart of essential end markets. Before moving to our next slide, it's worth revisiting the topic that we addressed during our Investor Day event back in September, the topic being the intentional output of the portfolio you see in front of you with the intention being that no single product contributes more than 5% to Jabil's overall earnings. This result is a good thing. It's a really good thing, especially when we think about dependability and sustainability. It also shines a bright light on the strategic importance of diversification and scale and the clear impact it has when operating our business. In recognizing our Q1 results, along with our 2Q guide as detailed by Adam and Mike, combined with a watchful eye on the back half of the year, we find ourselves with an updated financial plan for FY '23, an outlook which has us increasing core earnings per share to $8.40, an increase of $0.25 from our forecast roughly 90 days ago. In addition, we believe that core operating margin will hold at 4.8% for the year on revenue of roughly $34.5 billion, while free cash flow remains north of $900 million. Integral to this outlook is the fact that our team is doing an exceptional job of proactively managing costs and controlling what they can control in today's environment. Moving to our next slide. I'll share thoughts on our path forward. Shown here are fundamental catalysts, which are key to favorable results and future outcomes for Jabil: The unique combination of our approach, structure and experience, our ability to execute, combined with our engineering expertise, financial plans that are grounded in rational assumptions and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. And rounding on our path forward, maybe it makes sense to step back a bit and think about the past few years. The data suggests that what we're doing is working, a testament of just how well our team is managing the business I'd now like to transition from our path to our purpose. Here at Jabil, we're never confused about our obligation to deliver a fair return to shareholders. With this obligation well understood, and considering the upcoming holiday season, we're taking a little extra time to heighten our focus on ensuring a meaningful purpose in all we do. We're encouraging our employees to take a deep breath and a short pause, creating a little time for reflection, reflect on our team, reflect on their personal lives and reflect on giving back to those in need. And speaking a reflection, when it comes to helping those in need, I'm proud to report that our employees around the world just surpassed 1 million hours of personal volunteer time for calendar 2022. What a positive difference created for so many around the world, so many who need it most. Our team's effort was extraordinary. And in multiple ways, their effort was life-changing. Here at Jabil, we fully embraced the meaning and importance of carrying a purpose, both at home and in the workplace. And we do so with exceptional conduct and care. I'm just so honored to serve such a strong and steady team. Their approach is responsible and reliable. They value the relationships we have with all of those that we serve. Each day, we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. And in doing so, Jabil is making the world just a little bit better. In closing, to all of you here at Jabil, please know that you can be your true self without anxiety or fear recourse each day when you come to work. And to everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday season.  With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Adam. Steve, that's an area of our business. As you know, it's embedded in our industrial business. We don't tend to break out all the individual products. But in terms of overall energy management, clean energy, et cetera, that's an area where, if you take a look at our overall industrial growth, I would say that the growth rate of that component of our industrial business is greater than most of the other industrial business. So whether it be solar, whether it be off-grid battery storage, whether it be new efficiency of off-grid power generation, mobile power generation, it's an area that's, from a strategy standpoint, very important in the next three to four years of the overall industrial business. I'd equate it -- I don't know that the growth will be as secular as maybe EVs. But five, six years ago, when we made decisions to go hard into the EV market and move a lot of our resources that way, you could think of it a bit the same in terms of our overall industrial business. That part of our industrial business is getting a lot of attention. Yes. You're welcome. I guess I'd make a general statement and a specific statement. I think one of the interesting characteristics of Jabil is to be really effective in this business over the long term, I think scale matters. And then in one of the slides that we just indexed through, if you look at the overall portfolio today that make up the $34 billion, $35 billion of revenue, the balance of the portfolio is substantial.  And so again, coming back to your specific question, when I think about the markets that you're referring to, A, we've got a whole set of engineering staff that are, let's just say, expert in that area. But much like all of our businesses, they also have a vast pool of engineering resources in other sectors that they also get to confer with and talk to and think about being creative in terms of overall solutions in the industrial space. And I think that makes a big difference. Hey, Jim. I think for the quarter, so if we backward look to September, October, November with the kind of zero COVID policy, everything that was in the media around China and then kind of our exposure to that and our experience with that, in very round numbers, I would say that the kind of overall China COVID activities probably impacted Q1 by about $10 million, give or take. As you've seen recently, and maybe you're referring to this with some recent changes around the zero COVID policy, we'll continue to manage that in much the same way, being very careful, practical, thoughtful in terms of managing China coming out of a zero COVID policy. We've been doing that around the world since January of 2020. I think our protocols around the world and in China are kind of best-in-class. And I think protocols and processes aside, Jim, I give a huge amount of credit to our leadership team and our supervisors on the ground in China. We have a fabulous relationship with our people and our employees, and that in and of itself makes a huge difference. So anyway, that's our intent. Yes. I'm not going to get into customer-specific. I think when it comes to parts of our cloud business, Jim, we've been very, very consistent. And I don't know the first time we came out on a call and started talking about our entry into the cloud business based on our right to play and the solutions that our team wanted to bring forward. But what we talked about maybe back in 2018 and through 2019 and even through 2020 and COVID and on and on and on, we've been extremely consistent with the fact that our value proposition in that area of our business is very geocentric and very asset-light. And said differently, we do a very good job of aligning variable costs with the puts and takes of the revenue. This is nothing more than that continuing. And the team has done an absolutely fantastic job of growing that business. I think on one of the slides again that we showed, you can see our cloud business or let's just say, cloud and 5G is now $6 billion, give or take. So I think that's a proxy for how successful they've been. And again, we'll continue, and our intent is to continue to run that an asset-light way. I think it's a natural decision. We -- the world is, I don't know if I use the word difficult, but let's just, for lack of a better word, things are a bit choppy right now, a little bit difficult. And whether it's running our business in each sector of our business, in a different way based on what customers need, whether it's our execution, whether it's overall cost management, I think when we sat here in August, September, and we're taking a hard look at the year. Our belief is that we should be maybe a bit more cautious to the back half of the year as we sit today.  So Mike and I got together with our leadership team, and I'm really pleased with the outcome. And by the way, this was a hard press by the overall team. We're just being proactive in terms of largely in terms of overhead costs and maybe costs that sit on top of the factories. I think that Mike said in his prepared remarks. And I think one thing I think it's worth differentiating, being proactive in the methods in the way we're being proactive in terms of cost management is, to me, way different than say writing off or writing down assets. It's really about taking a look at the business, being aggressive and proactive and then being sure that shareholders get a very fair return on that in short order. And I think Mike in his prepared remarks somewhere said on our cost management and the charge we took in the quarter, investors will get about a dime back at the back half of this year. But more importantly is, is I think the payback for '24 and into perpetuity will be $0.20, $0.25. So I think it's good use of our effort and nice returns for shareholders. Thank you. Happy holidays to you too. I don't know that there's a general theme. I think we have 400-plus customers, and I think our customers' thoughts are all over the map, and they're doing the best for their business based on their products. Everything -- and this will give you a little bit of a feel for the complexity of it. And by the way, it's why our structure is so efficient and so optimal in terms of customer solutions.  Here at Jabil, we don't run our business on a factory basis. We run it customer by customer, line item by line item. And the reason we do that is let's just take a product that, let's say, the unit cost is x, but the ability to move that product around the world in terms of distributing the product is very expensive. Well, that would suggest maybe we build it in-region. We have other products that cost y and moving that product around the world is very small relative to the cost of the product, and we might consolidate that to a single spot in the world. Then you add to it, all the different geopolitical issues, the very unfortunate issue that continues to wane on in the Ukraine. So it's hard for me to go, geez, this is kind of the herd mentality of our customers because the business just doesn't act that way. Also, I would suggest that when you look at our portfolio, and you look at the eight sectors that we define and then you think about all the subsectors of the business, Again, one of the things I think is a huge strength at Jabil is the diversification. And with that diversification becomes endless amounts of solutions. And again, I take you back to our approach and our structure. We kind of work with each customer in a very unique way, accommodating their needs. With that being said, I would say that you'll probably see us do some expansion in Eastern Europe. You'll probably see us continue to expand in Mexico. I think we feel pretty good about our footprint in China. And you'll probably see some expansion over the next couple of years in India. We're taking them up because we can. I mean, as we sit here today, one could look at it and go, why would you guys take the numbers up, if you're somewhat cautious about the back half of the year or gosh knows what's going to happen in '23 based on what the U.S. Fed is doing in the markets, et cetera, et cetera. But I think we use very good judgment. Again, a real good charm about Jabil is we break our business up into really, really, really small pieces. And it gives us really good acuity, high resolution of all elements of our business. So in a more general sense, I think the -- again, referring back to one of the slides that one of us spoke to is we're -- as we sit today, we're going to -- we think we'll see double-digit growth in the areas of auto and transportation largely driven by EVs. Healthcare, I think we showed on the slide would be maybe north of 10%, and then same with our industrial semi cap business largely being led on the industrial side. And the growth in all three of those areas, A, supply chain is getting better and getting better faster. One caveat there is, is legacy semiconductors in the EV space are still tight. But supply chain is getting markedly better. Our ability to gather parts relative to others is very strong. And then in certain aspects of those, based on certain trends, demand is holding reasonably well. If I could add to that, here's a real simple way to think about it in very round numbers. Two years ago, the overall op margin for the company was 4.2%. Last year, it was 4.6%. This year, at the beginning of the year, we suggested that the op margin for the year will be 4.8%. We're holding to that 4.8%, which we're proud of. So there's a 20 bps expansion between '22 and '23. About half of that is based on our cost management for the back half of the year as well as continuing to advance our asset-light nature of our cloud business and the other half of that is the lack of a better word, the core business. But what's interesting is, I don't even like differentiating that because for me, all of this activity goes hand in hand with running a good business. So -- but in terms of your modeling and the way to think about it, I think that's a reasonable way to think about it. Ruplu, that's a little bit of an open-ended question because I don't know if you mean it this way, but I'll answer it how I understand it, which is if the bottom falls out of all consumer-facing products, could the overall DMS margins go down further? Maybe. As we sit today, I think we've done a reasonably good job of for what we know, handicapping the back half of the year. And you -- the way you stated it is largely correct. We've really kind of haircut and handicap any consumer-facing products. And again, the reciprocal of that is we feel good about industrial, automotive and healthcare. If you -- as you're putting your model together for the year, we just reported first quarter -- we just gave you a hard guide on 2Q. As I think about Q3 and Q4, our DMS margins, as you start putting numbers together and do your after calls and whatnot, I think what you'll find is doing the math is to have our DMS business end up being at 5% or 5.1% margin. Whatever it ends up being, Q4 is going to end up being a pretty strong quarter. And I think that's reflective of exactly what you said, which is some of the higher margins in auto and healthcare. I would also -- why we're on the topic of the year is, let's not be -- let's be sure it's not lost on us, the hard work and the complementary work that our EMS team is doing in terms of their business and margins for the year as well. When we went into 1Q, on the EMS side, we thought margins would be in the 4%, 4.1% range, that came in 4.3%. If you take a look at our guide and do your math on that, you'll see the strong margins returns in 2Q. And then if you think about the year on the EMS side, last year, I don't remember the exact number, but EMS was 4.2%, 4.3%. Beginning of the year, we thought EMS would be -- for the year, EMS would be around 4.4%, 4.5%. And I think EMS is going to come in closer to 4.6%, 4.7%. So again, let's step back and just have an appreciation for the fact that the business is kind of an entire portfolio. And I say that respectfully I understand your question was around DMS. I hope that helps. Ruplu, I'll intercept that one for a minute. Wow, that was a lot. Let me bring you back to what I think was the first part of the question, which is, yes, you're correct. In the first quarter, at an enterprise level, margins were 4.8%. I kind of think you answered your own question, which is 1Q of last year, margins were 4.7%. We thought that the first quarter would come in back in August, September, we were guiding and anticipating the margins for Q1 would be 4.8%. They came in right on top of the 4.8%. Again, I'll bring you back to DMS margins were down about 20 basis points. EMS margins were up 20 basis points, again, indication of the size, scale, but again, the wonderful diversification we have.  If we didn't have good understandings with our customers in terms of equitable sharing when variable costs go up and down, we wouldn't have delivered the 4.8%. So I don't say that to drive a concern. I say that much in an opposite way, which is the way we have our business set up, the way we have our customer relationship set up are very satisfactory to our leadership team. In terms of what else could have impacts on the overall margins for the year, it could be anything. On the downside, it could be that -- the macro gets worse on the -- so what do I worry about? Yes, the macro could collapse is that in the other, but then that instability will be there for everybody. What I don't worry about is, I don't worry about our team's ability to execute. I don't worry about our team in and of itself. I love the portfolio that we have. I don't worry about the size of the market. I don't worry about our ability to continue to gain share. And maybe you wrap all that up I think our team, both at a factory level and above factory does a really, really nice job of controlling what we can control. Well, that's an interesting question. I've been at this a long time, and I'd make this comment not directly around my relationship with Kenny. Whether my relationships with Kenny or Borges or Dastoor or McCoy or JJ or all the folks that you've met, we have a significantly tight-knit group. We've all been at this a long time. Sometimes that becomes problematic because it feels sometimes like we've complete each other's sentences. So we've got to continue to challenge ourselves so we don't have a group think. But Kenny has been with us a long time, so has the balance of the team. I don't envision any of this being revolutionary. I think it will be evolutionary. We also added some other new leadership to the team recently with LaShawne and Kristine in legal. So I think we'll carry on. With that being said, as I continue to move more and more throughout the year into an active Chairman role, and you're right, I'll have my hands firmly involved with investors and our foundation and strategy and other stuff, I hope the team takes my 10 or 11 years and is disruptive in a positive sense. I think one of the things that this team has done over and over and over and over, and time and time again over 30 years is I think we're proactive. I think we change when we need to change. We don't change for the sake of changing. And I'd say, Kenny and some of the expanded leadership team is probably, in some sense, a little bit more edgy than I can be. And I think that's a good thing. So I think there'll be I think there'll be some good changes. You can think of them as evolutionary, not revolutionary changes because the foundation we've built for this business has never been stronger. And I'm really, really, really looking forward to the next two, three, four years to see how things shake out. David, well first off, welcome to the group. I think you just started coverage on us, and we look forward to spending more time with you so you can better understand the business. In terms of your questions, there's pent-up demand, but I would caveat answering your question similar to a prior question, which is I don't want to make a blanket statement because, as an example, let's take networking or, say, legacy telco. That part of our business today is about $3 billion on a $35 billion base. So in terms of what type of backlog we see from the telco folks or the networking folks, I guess it's relevant. But in terms of our overall corporate results, I'm not sure how impactful that might be. I think a 100% we have seen pent-up demand and backlog across almost every single area of our business where supply chain constraints existed. If I could paint it with a broad brush and take this with a degree of inaccuracy, I guess, because I'm trying to paint it with a broad brush across a large-scale portfolio, I think that most of the pent-up demand and the backlog, in general, will probably be alleviated by late 1Q of '23 or into the second quarter of '23, to say the first half of '23. So I think most of the pockets of backlog clear and normalized as we get back -- as we get to the back half of calendar '23. Again, I don't know if that's helpful or not, but that's kind of a general statement as we look across the business. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. With that, this does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day, and happy holidays."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. As Adam just detailed, our performance in Q1 was quite strong. I continue to be extremely pleased with the strength of our business, which delivered double-digit growth in revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in the quarter. Our diversified portfolio and continued participation in end markets with long-term secular trends was once again reflected in our Q1 performance.  I'd now like to walk you through our balance sheet and cash flow performance in the quarter. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $166 million and net capital expenditures totaled $164 million. As a reminder, our customers routinely co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then later reimbursed to us by customers. Due to the high dollar value of these co-investments from our customers and how they are reflected on our cash flow statement, it is important to net the two line items shown on the slide to reflect the true CapEx number and what we refer to as net capital expenditures.  For the quarter, inventory days came in at 78, down 1 day sequentially on improved working capital management by the team. As a reminder, we offset a portion of our inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers. Net of these deposits, inventory days were 61 in Q1, also down 1 day from Q4. We continue to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY '23 as some of the supply chain constraints continue to improve.  We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x on cash balances of $1.2 billion. Turning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '23 to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.4 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $4.1 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $347 million to $407 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $319 million to $379 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.64 to $2.04. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.84. Interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately $67 million and for the year to be in the range of $265 million to $270 million, which is higher than we forecasted in September due to more conservative interest rate and working capital assumptions. The tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 19%. Moving to the next slide, where I'll offer an update on the end market demand assumptions that we noted in September. As a reminder, our FY '23 guidance assumed a moderate economic slowdown and some moderation in growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Based on what we know today, our assumptions from a demand perspective remain largely consistent. Across many of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient, particularly in areas that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds like electric vehicles, healthcare, renewable energy infrastructure 5G and cloud. We continue to expect these secular markets to expand in the pace of an economic slowdown. At the same time, we also continue to expect some consumer-centric end markets to underperform year-on-year consistent with our thoughts in September. All together, we still expect good growth in FY '23, as you'll see detailed on the next slide. Starting with our automotive business, which continues to outperform despite global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates. We've seen this rapid acceleration manifest in FY '23 automotive revenue growth expected to be in excess of 40% year-on-year. We're also expecting double-digit year-over-year growth in our healthcare business, which continues to benefit from an outsourcing of manufacturing trend and has historically been recession resistant with long product life cycles accretive margins and stable cash flows. Further, our industrial business is also expected to expand by double digits this year, fueled by growth in clean and smart energy infrastructure as government legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. accelerates investment in the space. And in 5G wireless, we continue to expect solid year-on-year growth. Infrastructure rollouts are accelerating, and our localized manufacturing capabilities are leading to growth in other geos such as India. We expect these rollouts to play out over the next several years regardless of near-term economic conditions.  Within our cloud business in September, we detailed our plan to shift certain components we procure and integrate from a purchase and resale model to a customer control consignment service model. This transition, in fact, began in November, which is earlier than our expectations 90 days ago. As a result, revenue would be lower than previously expected as an incremental $300 million of components was shipped to the new model. This is in addition to the $500 million of consignment impact we announced in September. Adjusting for this shift, we expect continued robust unit growth in the cloud space in FY '23 and beyond. In summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand across many of our end markets to remain strong with year-over-year revenue growth at an enterprise level to be approximately 3% for FY '23 despite an assumed economic slowdown in the second half of the fiscal year. Now turning to the next slide. We have intentionally structured our business with the aim of delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth, strong predictable cash flows and shareholder returns. With that in mind, while we continue to expect growth in our business despite recessionary headwinds, we have identified certain cost savings mainly in our SG&A and support organization for the second half of our fiscal year as we continue to look at doing more with less. And noncore expenses associated with our optimization activities will be approximately $45 million, with the benefits expected in the back half of the fiscal year. We anticipate these costs will result in a net benefit to core earnings per share of approximately $0.10 in FY '23 and $0.20 in FY '24. This benefit has been considered in our updated core EPS outlook for FY '23 of $8.40. We expect the cash outlay associated with our optimization efforts to be incurred over the next two quarters, and we continue to expect free cash flow of more than $900 million in the fiscal year. We expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment and feel the steps we've taken to optimize our business are appropriate and make us stronger. I would like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Hey, Steve. Yes, so the inventory days that we just printed 61 days, down 1 day from Q4. A normalized run rate, Steve, would be around that 55, 57. That's what I expect. Not anytime soon, but that is the ultimate sort of aim. I do expect that 61 days to continue to go down to that 58, 59 level. There will be quarterly nuances, timing nuances, et cetera. But overall, the trend would be in the downward direction, particularly with the supply chain constraints easing, as you mentioned. And Jim, if I could just add, I think when we gave guidance in September, our assumption was that the consignment would start sometime in March. We actually managed to get it done far earlier in November. So you're seeing an earlier impact of this consignment piece showing up in our -- a little bit in Q1 but mainly in Q2. And Shannon, our business assumptions continue to be extremely robust. I think I highlighted some of the secular trends that we're actually participating in. All of those continue to show very decent growth. So yes, it does move the needle a little bit on margin, but there's been some offsets. I think Adam highlighted some inefficiencies that we had on the mobility side in China, particularly in Q1. We've made some assumptions around further COVID, et cetera, as well in parts of the world, and that does have a little bit of an impact on margin. But you're right, on the consigned side, it has a small margin improvement impact. And that's one of the reasons we pursue this with -- along with the customer. Yes. So the free cash flow assumptions that we have today that reflect everything reflect they reflect the sort of charge that we've taken, the cash outlay associated with that. Don't forget that the savings on the other side of that as well. So there is definitely everything that's out there is reflected in the free cash flow. From a Q1 standpoint, I think it's more timing. We've talked about our CapEx being in that 2.5% range. Not much changes from that 2.5% guidance that we provided in September. You'll always have timing differences. You'll have nuances. From a shape of the year perspective, I sort of -- I'd just use shapes from previous years. I think it will be very similar to that. Obviously, timing moves things here and there a little bit. But overall, we still feel committed to our $900 million free cash flow number for the year as well. I would suggest all of you about, Paul, I think it's definitely a mix, operational efficiency, something we always execute on. We've always invested in the past around automation, robotics, et cetera. So we feel good about that as well. And overall, the margin, does it go beyond 5%, 5.5% as well. We're not stopping at 4.8%, and we're definitely not stopping it at 5% either. So it's something we're actively engaged in and feel very strongly about. No, there's no change to our capital allocation. We've talked about in September, we have another $1.1 billion left of our authorization. We continue to use it. We use quite a bit of that in Q1, and we'll be doing in the range of 150, 200-plus type of buybacks every quarter. So nothing that happens in the second half for -- also that, that actually be an opportunity to do some more in fact, if things start going south."

        "content": "Adam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. It's also our 7th Annual Virtual Investor Briefing. I'm Adam Berry, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. As a team here at Jabil, we're excited to share with you a couple of updates as it relates to our business. This includes some organizational updates as well as an outlook for fiscal 2025. We'll begin today's call with a quick introduction, setting the stage for what promises to be an informative session. Then, we'll move on to our 2024 results, led by Greg Hebard, our Chief Financial Officer. In thinking about 2024, it was a challenging year, no doubt, but it was also a very important year as we took some strategic strides as an organization while continuing to look after our customers, employees and shareholders. For starters, we divested our Mobility business for $2.2 billion, and returned the majority of those net proceeds to shareholders through a robust buyback program. Through this divestiture, we not only improved our diversification in terms of geographic footprint, but we also reduced our exposure to a business that required higher levels of capital. At the same time, the organization persevered in the face of some pretty stiff headwinds. This is evidenced by strong margins, roughly in-line core earnings per share, and strong free cash flows. And we did all this despite $6 billion less in revenue year over year. This suggests to me that Jabil is far more resilient today than when compared to previous downturns. And finally, we reorganized our internal structure to focus on speed, precision and solutions. This approach targets our ability to serve each distinct end market effectively by creating domain expertise in core areas and better positions Jabil for growth. As a result of the organizational realignment, we will transition our financial reporting structure from two segments to three. This change better reflects not only how we operate as a business today, but it also positions the organization for growth. The first segment is called Regulated Industries, led by Steve Borges. It is comprised of end markets that simply demand best-in-class care and manufacturing, as the products built in this segment keep us healthy, safe and moving ahead. In a bit, you will hear about our healthcare, automotive and transportation, and renewable energy infrastructure markets. Next, our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, led by Matt Crowley, has been designed to support end-to-end growth from the cloud to the data center and the networking and communications gear within, as the world further embraces artificial intelligence. And then finally, our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment, led by Andy Priestley, encompasses both consumer-facing products in Connected Living and retail and warehouse automation in Digital Commerce. Again, this enhanced organizational framework will enable greater focus, customer care, collaboration and growth. In a bit, you will hear from all three of these business leaders. And finally, we'll conclude with a business update from our newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Mike Dastoor. From Mike, you will hear about team, targets, strategy, and why we think Jabil is uniquely positioned to benefit from a recovery through our global capacity and network of factories. But before we jump into the details, please note that today's presentation is being live streamed, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To view these slides, please visit the Investor Relations section of jabil.com. After today's presentation concludes, a complete recording will be available on the website for playback. In addition, we will be making forward-looking statements during this presentation, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, we're excited to share our progress and future plans with you. Now, let's dive into the details.\nGreg Hebard: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join our call today. I'd like to begin this morning by walking through our fourth quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $7 billion in revenue, $364 million above the midpoint of the guidance range. This was driven by stronger-than-expected results in our connected devices, networking and storage markets. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $401 million, or 5.8% of revenue, a solid improvement of 20 basis points compared to last year. Net interest expense was better than expected, coming in at $65 million, which was due to lower inventory levels and strong working capital management. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $318 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.18. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.30, which is $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now, let's look at the numbers by segment for the quarter. Our DMS segment posted revenue of $3.5 billion, which exceeded expectations by $79 million. This was primarily due to stronger growth in our connected devices business, although it was slightly offset by lower-than-expected revenue in the automotive business. Year-over-year, DMS revenue was down approximately 22%. This decrease was mostly due to the Mobility divestiture. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.4%, slightly lower than expected, reflective of the mix. In the EMS segment, we saw revenue of $3.5 billion, which was $285 million higher than anticipated. This was driven by stronger demand in our advanced networking markets as we closed out the year. While EMS revenue was down roughly 13% year-over-year, mainly due to the ongoing softness in the end markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print, we did see solid year-on-year growth across our cloud, semi-cap, and warehouse automation markets. This dynamic drove core margins for EMS to 6.1% in Q4, up an impressive 90 basis points year-over-year. Moving now to our end market performance for the year. Compared to our thoughts in June, connected devices, networking and storage came in better than anticipated, while auto and transport came in slightly lower. All other end markets largely came in as expected. Shifting gears to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, we continue to see robust results. Inventory at the end of Q4 was down five days sequentially, bringing it to 76 days. After adjusting for inventory deposits, net inventory days were 54, which is a four-day improvement quarter-over-quarter. Thanks to disciplined working capital management by the team, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $535 million. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $116 million and, for the full fiscal year, came in at $661 million, or 2.3% of revenue. As a result of the strong fourth quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in north of $1 billion. We exited the fiscal year with a healthy balance sheet with debt-to-core-EBITDA levels of approximately 1.3 times and cash balances of approximately $2.2 billion. With that, let's now turn to our capital structure on the next slide. We ended FY '24 with capacity under our global credit facilities of $4 billion. With this available capacity in our year-end cash balances, we had access to more than $6.2 billion of available liquidity. Our debt and liquidity profile are both solid and we believe current maturities are appropriately staggered and at attractive interest rates. We also remain fully committed to maintaining our investment grade credit profile. Moving now to our capital returns to shareholders on the next slide. We have repurchased 5.3 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased to 19.4 million shares, or $2.5 billion, which completed our FY '24 share repurchase authorization. This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY '13 to approximately 128 million shares at an average price of approximately $47, bringing our total return to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $6.7 billion. Importantly, included in our earnings release this morning, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, which we expect to fully execute in FY '25. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach. Moving to the next slide. The team performed well in FY '24, operating within a highly dynamic environment. In summary, over the past year, we sold off our Mobility business and used the net gains to buy back $2.5 billion of our shares, all while managing temporary challenges in major end markets like renewables, electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure and semi-cap. However, looking at the broader perspective, the company continues to be highly resilient and is well-positioned for future revenue growth, margin enhancement, and delivering robust free cash flow. With that, let's turn to our next slide for our first quarter guidance, beginning with revenue by segment. As Adam highlighted earlier, we're pleased to unveil this new business unit organizational reporting segment structure today. We will transition our reporting segments in FY '25 from DMS and EMS to three new reporting segments, Regulated Industries, Intelligent Infrastructure and Connected Living & Digital Commerce. This change is aligned with our new management structure and with how we drive our long-term planning and forecasting. For Q1, we anticipate revenue for our Regulated Industries segment will be $2.9 billion, down 9% year-on-year, reflective of softness in the renewable energy and EV markets. For our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect revenue for the quarter to be $2.3 billion, down 4% year-on-year. This is mainly due to us exiting certain legacy networking businesses at the end of Q4 FY '24. In our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.4 billion. The year-over-year decline is primarily driven by our Mobility divestiture. Speaking of Mobility, I'd like to highlight the seasonality of our business in FY '25 will reflect the impact of the divestiture. As a reminder, our Mobility business typically generated a significant portion of its income during Q1. This means going forward, our quarterly income and earnings progression will more closely resemble our historical EMS business, where typically 40% of earnings come in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. So, you can expect a more back-half weighted year as we go forward. Moving now to the enterprise guidance. Total company revenue for Q1 is expected to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Core operating income for Q1 is estimated to be in the range of $304 million to $364 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $143 million to $223 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.83. Net interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately $65 million and, for FY '25, we expect it will be $245 million. And our core tax rate for Q1 and for the year is expected to be 21%, reflecting impacts of Pillar Two global minimum tax legislation and jurisdictional earnings mix. We continue to believe it's prudent to anticipate higher tax rates beyond FY '25 in the range of 23% to 24% due to additional expected impacts from global minimum tax legislation. Moving to the next slide for our FY '25 guidance. For the coming year, we expect approximately $27 billion in revenue, with core margins in the range of 5.4%, while core earnings per share is expected to be $8.65. Please keep in mind, in FY '24, we divested our Mobility business partway through the fiscal year, while we also made the strategic decision to reshape our portfolio away from products in the legacy networking space. When adjusting for these changes, which accounted for $2.4 billion in revenue in FY '24, we believe our organic growth in FY '25 will be 2.3% on a base of $26.4 billion. We are forecasting another robust year for free cash flow generation in FY '25, around $1.2 billion. Additionally, due to the Mobility divestiture, we anticipate lower capital expenditures in the coming year. For FY '25, we expect CapEx to be between 1.5% to 2% of revenue. Most notably, as in past years, we plan to return 80% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and our newly announced $1 billion buyback authorization. With that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in Jabil. [Commercials]\nSteve Borges: Hi, everyone. I am excited to share some details on our Regulated Industries segment. Each of the end markets in this segment plays a critical role in addressing some of the most pressing challenges and opportunities in the world. Let's first start with healthcare. Many of the macro trends we've been discussing for the last several calls remain unchanged. Connected care is creating new markets by enabling remote monitoring and telehealth solutions. Personalized medicine continues to drive improved patient outcomes, particularly in the management of chronic diseases. By tailoring treatments to individual patients, healthcare providers can achieve better results and enhance the quality of life for millions of people. In addition, the introduction of weight loss drugs or GLP-1s drugs are all becoming increasingly important in today's healthcare landscape. New care settings are also emerging, creating opportunities for innovation. As healthcare delivery evolves, we see a shift towards more decentralized and patient-centric models. This opens new avenues for developing advanced medical devices and technologies that can be used in a variety of settings from hospitals to the home. As a result, we continue with a strong pipeline of design engagements to enable connected devices and home healthcare products for our customers. Meanwhile, the tailwinds of growth in autoinjectors, medical devices and diagnostics continues, most especially with the advent of many new biologics and individualized testing platforms. Another significant trend is the need to simplify the supply chain. The complexities of the healthcare supply chain have been highlighted in recent years, most especially during the rise of COVID. There is a growing demand for streamlined and efficient solutions. This need for simplification is leading to expanded outsourcing as healthcare device companies seek partners who can provide comprehensive supply chain management, engineering, design and manufacturing expertise, coupled with the quality requirements our customers demand. We are the largest manufacturing solutions provider for the healthcare industry with great diversification, covering diagnostics, medical devices, orthopedics and pharmaceutical delivery systems. Staying the largest will require us to expand our capabilities and accelerate growth by entering areas of the market with macro tailwinds, which will provide an enormous amount of Jabil TAM expansion while focusing on specific geographies, like Croatia and the Dominican Republic, to fuel that growth. The expanded capabilities and geographies will enable us to further simplify the supply chains for our customers. Internally, the most powerful aspect of what we produce is that, every single day, millions of patients around the world are using a product manufactured by Jabil. Now, turning to our automotive and transportation end market. Our expertise in product industrialization and manufacturing continues to enable innovation in powertrain electrification, autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies. As the automotive and transportation industries undergo a transformative shift towards the mass adoption of electric vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems to meet global regulations and safety requirements, as well as the associated shift to centralized architectures, Jabil is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of transportation. We have seen some short-term volatility in demand due to regional changes in EV tariffs and incentives, which has been experienced across the entire automotive industry. The Jabil team has managed this well, supporting our customers as they manage their business through this unprecedented market evolution. Jabil remains partnered with global market-leading automotive OEMs across the most important technology platforms of the foreseeable future, advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, connectivity, electrification and software-defined vehicles. Three of these platforms are agnostic to vehicle type, providing us with an opportunity to support our customers, however they choose. Each year, we continue to add new automotive OEM customers and technology leaders, providing further diversification across our customer portfolio. This positions Jabil extremely well as the automotive industry works towards meeting future governmental vehicle emission targets. Outside of our automotive customers, we remain engaged with strategic OEMs and suppliers focused on advancing precision agriculture. We leverage experience gained from serving automotive customers, as well as capability expertise from across Jabil, such as optics and fluidics, to help our customers bring the most innovative new farming technologies to the market. As the automotive and transportation market recovers, Jabil is well-positioned to capitalize on growth with expanded strategic capabilities, including our new facility in Croatia, which will support the growth of our European automotive business. We are focused on technology collaborations and investments and capabilities that best serve our long-term OEM customers and expand Jabil's role within the value chain. We are committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions that enhance vehicle performance, sustainability, safety and connectivity. Jabil is recognized in the market for our ability to industrialize complex technology designs, develop robust supply chains, and create automotive-grade automation strategies for the next-generation technologies entering the market today. We deliver these highly complex products with speed and quality while meeting functional safety requirements. Now, transitioning to our renewables and energy infrastructure end market. Global electricity demand is expected to grow at approximately 60% through 2040, and renewable energy is at the center of achieving global climate goals. At Jabil, we are leveraging our expertise in manufacturing and supply chain management to support the adoption of renewable energy technologies. In addition, with our U.S. footprint and the Inflation Reduction Act, we are well-positioned to help our customers transition products globally into the U.S., which may allow our customers to take advantage of tax incentives. Our work spans a wide range of applications, from inverters and optimizers to wind turbines, energy storage systems and smart grid technologies. Our success in energy storage manufacturing has positioned us to now extend into the automated assembly of critical elements of grid level storage systems, such as battery modules. This capability is expected to be leveraged by customers engaged in residential storage as the attach rate of these systems rise due to policy changes. Complementing the growth in renewable energy, we continue to add new customers that focus on energy management and building controls. Overall, the design, manufacturing and supply chain needs of renewable energy companies are becoming more complex, which increases their need to work with companies like Jabil. Customers appreciate the fact that we are committed to delivering high quality, reliable solutions that meet the growing demand for clean energy. Our modular and scalable designs allow for flexible deployment, optimizing resource use and reducing costs. I will now pass it along to Matt.\nMatt Crowley: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm excited to share some insights into our work in the Intelligent Infrastructure segment and discuss the evolution of cloud technology cycles, including the transformative impact of artificial intelligence. Our segment is dedicated to developing and delivering cutting-edge solutions that support the backbone of the modern digital ecosystem. This includes everything from cloud and data center infrastructure to telecommunications, networking and capital equipment. Each of these end markets plays a crucial role in shaping the future of how we connect, compute and communicate. The evolution of digital technology has laid a robust foundation for today's advancements. Starting with e-commerce in the '90s, moving through Web 2.0 in the early 2000s, and advancing with cloud computing, mobile apps and big data in the early 2010s, each phase has been pivotal. Now, we're on the cusp of a new era. Thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning. These emerging technologies promise to reshape everything in our lives, from solving major health conditions to seamless autonomous transportation, emphasizing the critical role of cloud infrastructure as an enabler to these innovations. AI is the next cloud technology cycle, revolutionizing the way we process and analyze data, enabling more intelligent and automated decision making. At Jabil, we're at the center of this evolution, providing our customers with advanced manufacturing solutions, they need to stay competitive in a rapidly changing landscape. Our expertise in this segment allows us to support the development and deployment of next-generation technologies to the market. The journey to fully harness AI comes with its own set of challenges that spur innovation and investment. Old compute architectures are inefficient for new models, necessitating the development of massive parallel architectures that drive huge data transfer needs. Additionally, AI requires immense amounts of energy. As processing power demands continue to exceed the capabilities of conventional cooling methods, there's an increase in need for advanced liquid cooling solutions. While liquid cooling has been around for many years, it has traditionally been a way to deliver efficiency. With the explosion of AI and the high-power GPUs required to fuel it, liquid cooling is now a requirement to deliver capacity and will soon be the standard for how data centers address cooling. The pace of innovation associated with today's GPU silicon is twice as fast as legacy silicon architectures. This creates new challenges when launching products from development into production. In our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, Jabil has built engineering and architecture capabilities that allow us to enable this transition of hardware from development to production at scale, while also enabling us to keep pace with the accelerated development cycles we see being driven in the market today. Additionally, as GPU speeds increase, so does the need for high bandwidth interconnect, driving the need for cost and power-efficient photonic interconnect. Across all of these technologies, we are actively investing in capabilities that offer our customers differentiated value for solutions that meet these emerging requirements. One specific example of differentiated capability is our recently announced investment in Jabil's advanced packaging OSAT and process development facility for photonics. This technology will become more important over time, as power continues to become more scarce and the need for higher speed and lower latency inside systems becomes more important. Our investments in this space positions Jabil to be at the center of one of the next innovation cycles, as the industry moves to co-packaged optics and on-chip solutions. In addition to our focus on creating these key capabilities, we're also expanding our footprint in strategic geographies as we scale our support of AI data center buildouts. Our facility in Pune, India, is a key manufacturing site for our AI customers and has executed exceptionally well. And while our demand for manufacturing in India has been driven by AI-related hardware requirements, Jabil has customers across all three of our segments asking us to leverage the region. Because of this, we have recently announced our intention to further expand our footprint in the country. The unique capabilities we have built throughout this technology value chain are core to a strategy that is both agile and resilient, giving Jabil the ability to support massive scale from secular tailwinds like AI, while being ready for whatever comes next in the market. Ultimately, Jabil is a key player within the technology ecosystem, ready to help customers overcome today's challenges and prepare for tomorrow. We're leveraging our expertise to support the increasing demand for advanced processors, high-speed photonics and sophisticated hardware solutions. Our solutions are designed to be scalable, secure and adaptable, helping our customers to stay ahead. I'll now pass it along to Andy to speak about the Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment.\nAndy Priestley: Thanks, Matt. Hello, everyone. I lead Jabil's Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment. Today, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk to you about our work in digital commerce and more specifically warehouse automation. When we think about the definition of commerce, it's the exchange of goods and services, especially on a large scale. Commerce is made possible by production and fulfillment. And at Jabil, we are a critical enabler within that ecosystem. Jabil is the largest manufacturing solutions provider for digital commerce and warehouse automation customers. Our expertise and scale allow us to support the largest players in this industry as they navigate the complexities of digitization and automation. Leaders in this market are focused on digitization. In the aisles, electronic shelf labels and other connected technologies are becoming part of a unified commerce strategy. These innovations are transforming the shopping experience, making it more seamless and efficient for the consumer and allowing a higher standard of compliance for the retailer. At the checkout, most shoppers are now using contactless payments. Jabil is a leading provider of point of sale and self-checkout solutions, having over 15 years of experience building and now designing these products. This shift in technology not only enhances convenience, but also aligns with the growing demand for safer, touch-free interactions. Additionally, research shows that most consumers today are likely to choose a business that offers grab-and-go services over a more traditional business model, highlighting the importance of speed and convenience in the modern retail landscape. Another element of the digital commerce system that may not be as immediately visible or apparent is what happens behind the scenes in warehouses and distribution centers around the world. Billions of dollars of goods are moved through these warehouses and fulfillment centers every day, and warehouse automation has seen significant growth. The integration of digitization, automation and robotics in these environments is revolutionizing the way we manage inventory and fulfill orders. E-commerce has more than doubled since 2019 to over $1.2 trillion to-date. This would not have been possible without higher and higher levels of automation being deployed in these fulfillment centers globally. Jabil is working both directly and indirectly with many of the world's largest brands on autonomous mobile robots, automated sorting systems and automated guided vehicles. At Jabil, we're constantly looking for ways to help solve some of the macroeconomic issues facing industry today. For example, the availability and cost of labor, to name but one. Jabil builds over 1,000 warehouse robots a month and powers another 4,000 a month with sub-assemblies that we also make. As we look to the future, we have several exciting projects that look to solve these labor issues with even more creative humanoid robotic solutions. As I have already discussed, digitization, automation and robotics can play a role in a wide range of settings, all of which are designed to increase safety, improve day-to-day operational efficiency, and deliver a superior customer experience. From automated picking and packing to real-time inventory management, these technologies are driving significant improvements in productivity, cost, accuracy and compliance. At Jabil, we're committed to helping our customers stay ahead of this curve by providing innovative solutions that address their unique challenges. For example, we have used our expertise in 3D printing to create solutions that allow our customers to solve technical issues and provide superior products to the markets they serve. We're constantly looking for ways to continue to help our customers become more efficient and meet the needs of their own customers. Our goal is to enable a more connected, efficient and customer-centric approach to commerce and logistics. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation and deliver value to our customers in these exciting and rapidly evolving fields. Now, I'd like to pass it off to Mike Dastoor for closing.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Andy, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Over the last three months, I've had the opportunity to travel to a number of our sites and spend a lot of time on the shop floor with our teams. Let me address a question that understandingly came up a number of times in my travels, and which I believe many of you on the call have as well. I'm often asked, \"Mike, are you going to change the strategy? What are you going to do differently?\" Well, our enterprise-level strategy is sound and, while I have made some changes to focus the organization more on profitable growth while also reducing risk, I will largely maintain the same direction that has allowed us to be so successful for the past few years. Our diversified approach across multiple end markets with secular trends continues to provide a solid foundation. This approach was pressure tested in FY '24, as we faced multiple headwinds across several end markets and still delivered strong margins and free cash flow. Today, the company is much more resilient than in years past. During my first few months as CEO, I've spent considerable time ensuring we have the right people leading our three distinct businesses. Each of these businesses has a different growth expectation, lead time, margin and balance sheet profile, outsourcing maturity levels and product lifecycle times. It was imperative to ensure our teams remain focused in their respective areas of domain expertise. Based on what I've seen in the last three months, I feel like we've gotten that part right. We have three business leaders in Steve, Matt and Andy that have the tenure and experience in Jabil, solid pedigree, deep domain expertise and know-how to run a global manufacturing business at scale. I also believe we have the right team running our factories, led by Fred McCoy, another nearly 25-year Jabil employee. Fred's unique combination of commercial experience and manufacturing operations will allow us to be more agile and more efficient as the complexities of manufacturing continue to grow. And finally, our supply chain organization is in exceptional hands with Frank McKay. Frank has developed a highly-experienced, long-tenured team with extremely strong relationships in the supply chain over the last 25 years, which, along with investments and advanced supply chain systems, gives me full confidence that Jabil continues to be best-in-class in the industry. This well-rounded enterprise leadership team is already delivering results, securing new business across each of our distinct segments. In Regulated Industries, Jabil continues to partner with global market-leading automotive OEMs, offsetting EV demand softness with new wins, particularly as tariffs dictate the localized manufacturing of vehicles. In healthcare, we will soon be expanding our GLP-1 drug delivery business in Europe, through new wins with existing customers. We've taken our manufacturing and automation and industrialization capabilities designed in the U.S. market and replicated those efforts in Europe, which we believe will result in solid multiyear growth. We've also recently won new programs in the diabetes wearables area. As mentioned earlier, lead times on new wins in the healthcare space due to medical validation requirements means these wins only show up in FY '26 and FY '27. In Intelligent Infrastructure, our team is squarely situated at the center of the data center infrastructure backbone. We lead with design and engineering to build the hardware and infrastructure that will enable artificial intelligence. Jabil is also well-positioned to participate in the recovery of the capital equipment end market during our fiscal '25. Year-on-year, we expect the Intelligent Infrastructure segment to be up by $1 billion after adjusting for the exit of legacy networking businesses Greg mentioned earlier. In Connected Lifestyle & Digital Commerce, our team is driving innovative solutions to address our customers' desire to automate their warehouse and retail environments as labor becomes increasingly difficult to find. As we move through FY '25, our digital commerce business will grow, as we have won new programs with both new and existing customers in that space. Also, while early days, the robot and humanoid end market seems to be evolving rapidly, and Jabil is currently participating in that. At Jabil, we build staff, leveraging our vast engineering capabilities, global footprint and long-term partnerships. Technologies constantly evolve, but Jabil will continue to skate to the park by investing in engineering-led tuck-in capabilities which will allow Jabil to be technology agnostic. For instance, in the automotive sector, Jabil has built engineering capabilities that are equipped to support both hybrid and EV platforms, depending on which one prevails. In the data center infrastructure space, Jabil has built engineering and architecture capabilities that allow us to keep pace with the accelerated development cycles and transition from older computer architecture to GPU-led system level design and hardware production at scale. This, along with our investments in OSAT and power management engineering capabilities, means we're in a good position to offer our customers differentiated value for the solutions that meet the ever evolving requirements in this space. Similarly, in the digital commerce space, Jabil's advanced automation engineering investments uniquely position us to provide automation solutions across various fields, including retail warehouses and robots. Transitioning to our financial priorities and unique approach to the market, it's important to highlight that both will remain consistent. Six years ago, we deliberately refocused our organization with the intention of achieving core operating margin expansion, consistent earnings growth at robust predictable cash flows. To this end, we align the management compensation metrics to better match investor expectations. None of this changes. And importantly, our capital allocation framework continues to be aimed at creating long-term value for shareholders. And when it comes to our approach with customers, we utilize customer-centric work sales that are focused on supporting a single customer. This approach is highly effective and sets us apart from competitors. Regardless of the customers manufacturing location worldwide, a dedicated team supports them across the three regions in Asia, the Americas and Europe. Each work cell provides tailored solutions in three key areas of expertise, advanced engineering-led engagements, AI, ML supported manufacturing solutions, and robust supply chain systems. Currently, around 70% of our engagements are led by engineering initiatives. The complexities of modern supply chains and geopolitical challenges, along with the need for advanced software solutions and manufacturing closer to the end market have significantly enhanced Jabil's value proposition. This increased engagement means enhanced stickiness and margin improvement compared to even five or six years ago. And when you look a level deeper within each of our segments, you'll find an exceptionally diverse array of customers, including some of the world's biggest, most innovative and successful brands. This is by no means a complete list of the customers we serve today, but it's certainly impressive by any standard, especially when considering many of our customers rely on Jabil as the sole source for their products. Now, let's discuss our global footprint, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage. To be abundantly clear, we place considerable value on maintaining a large-scale global manufacturing footprint. However, as the geopolitical situation continues to evolve, our ability to adapt, combined with our designation as a U.S. domiciled manufacturing service provider, is becoming increasingly important as we help our customers navigate this complexity. Following the divestiture of our Mobility business, our footprint has become largely balanced with nearly one-third of our factories located in each of the Americas, Europe and Asia. Over time, we believe there will be further demand for manufacturing that resides closer to the end customer. And for that reason, we will work with our customers that seek to near or re-shore their manufacturing, whether it be a bifurcated approach or simply lift and shift. As this dynamic plays out, I believe our factories in both Europe and the Americas will see considerable growth. Today, we have approximately 40 sites in North America, approximately 30 of which are in the U.S., ready to take advantage of any near or reshoring to North America. With that said, a lot of the world's supply chain is still very much embedded in Asia, and some of our most efficient factories are located there. As we sit today, we currently have capacity in place to support an excess of $30 billion of revenue. Over the near term in FY '25, we expect to carry higher than normal levels of excess capacity. We are doing this because we firmly believe many of the end markets we serve will recover. This underutilized capacity will weigh on core operating margins in FY '25 by 20 basis points to 30 basis points, even after the mainly headcount-related restructuring charges we disclosed this morning. Over the longer term, my team and I strongly believe we're well-positioned to capitalize on significant global trends in sectors such as AI, data center infrastructure, healthcare, pharmaceutical solutions, and warehouse automation, as Steve, Matt and Andy highlighted. As a result, Regulated Industries will grow 5% to 8% with longer lead times, while Intelligent Infrastructure will grow more quickly at 7% to 10%. Over the next several years, we believe Connected Living & Digital Commerce will grow low-to-mid single digits, driven mainly by double-digit growth in digital commerce and warehouse automation. Putting this all together, we believe our long-term enterprise growth rate should be in the range of 5% to 7%. Given this anticipated mix of business, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 9% to 10%. And when combined with operational efficiencies, our 6% margin target remains intact over the longer-term. And when you consider our strong free cash flow generation and consistent returns to shareholders, core EPS should grow between 12% to 15% over the longer term, all of which would continue to drive consistent ROIC north of 30%. In closing, one thing is for sure, it is our people who make us strong. Our people are resilient. So, I just want to take a moment to say thank you to all our employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication, not just to our customers, but also to our communities and to each other. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Jabil story. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call back over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. As we wrap up our prepared comments today and we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I want to leave you with one final thought from me. At Jabil, we build stuff and we do it really, really well. And as we sit today, I believe we're focused on the right end markets with the right capabilities and we have a global yet agile manufacturing footprint. And from an enterprise level, you can expect our focus to remain on margins, cash flows, core EPS growth and shareholder return. Thank you for your time today. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. And congrats to Steve, Matt and Andy on your respective assignments. For my first question, I'd like to ask related to the cloud and data center infrastructure segment. Your guidance for fiscal '25 suggests 11% year-on-year growth. Are you seeing any slowdown? I mean, what is the impact from consignment in fiscal '25? And is low-double-digit the right way of thinking about revenue growth in this segment? And if you can talk about what your plan is to expand revenues in this segment beyond your existing customers?\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Ruplu, it's Mike. So, I'll start off, and then I'll hand it over to Matt to provide some more details. But before I start, I just want to thank the whole team here. There's a hurricane blowing outside. We were all hunkered down in the office to do this call, so thanks to the team. As regards to Intelligent Infrastructure, you're absolutely right, year-on-year, we're seeing, I think, the growth rate is about 12% if you back out the legacy network customer that we disengage with. We talked about it on the last call. I talked about it again on this call. So, I think it's a 12% growth rate year-on-year. Now, I'd like to remind you the Intelligent Infrastructure also has 5G in it and it has a cyclical semi-cap business as well. And obviously, in the up years, the semi-cap business will do well. In the down years, it will not. So, overall, if you look at the year-on-year increase, extremely valid over the long-term 7% to 10%, still extremely strong given the other parts of the business that are in this segment as well. So, I'll hand the call over -- I think, from a consignment, by the way, the impact is very small and I think the business that I'm most excited about and that Matt is most excited about is the whole data center infrastructure business that will continue to grow, and I expect that to grow in double-digits as well. Matt, if you want to just take the rest of the question?\nMatt Crowley: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Mike, and appreciate the question, Ruplu. Let me kind of focus on the back half of your question around our plans to expand the segment beyond our existing customers. So, we are hyper-focused on executing the strategy that we've put in place over the past 18 months. And a good proof point of that is our silicon photonics business. If you think back to last November, we announced a transaction that brought in capability and capacity. And inside of the first 12 months, we've already seen that pay off, in that we have now landed business with two new hyperscale accounts, which we're currently shipping product into. So, we're hyper-focused on executing there. We believe that our roadmap moving forward on the qualification of 800-gig parts as well as 1.6T, coming in calendar year '25, will allow us to continue to expand our customer base there. We're also super-focused on executing our power and cooling business in the data center. We're currently beginning to ramp our ability to help customers retrofit data centers, which today are air cooled, need to be retrofitted to go from air to liquid, and soon will be liquid to liquid. So, we really feel like the capabilities we've built over the past 18 months in these spaces is going to allow us to continue to expand the customer base. And we've already seen some really nice proof points of that to-date.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that, Matt and Mike. For my follow-up, I'll ask a question on healthcare. Again, looking at the growth rate for next year, 2% year-on-year seems a little low. Is the market itself growing low-single-digits right now? And can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the various end markets within healthcare? Mike, I think you talked about GLP-1. Can you talk a little bit about that? What does that add in terms of revenue margins? And is there a likelihood of another J&J type of deal going forward? So, just any details on the growth rate and what you're seeing in the markets?\nSteve Borges: Hi, Ruplu, this is Steve. Let me take that question. The overall healthcare market is growing about 3% to 4%. And we've been challenged this year. I think Mike mentioned this on prior earnings call, with the GLP-1 drugs, they've impacted our medical device segment really due to the reduction of the gastric bypass surgeries. But when I look at the business going forward, and I'll link to your question on GLP-1s as well, but now our healthcare business continues to be incredibly well-positioned. The growth of GLP-1 drugs and some of the new wins that we've been able to obtain, really associated with the injectors that we manufacture. And then, you take a look at just the challenge across the world as it relates to diabetes care, we had some nice new wins with CGMs, minimally invasive device growth, and the need for autoinjectors, generally speaking, because biologics are becoming dominant and with the complexities of the diseases. And so, we've won some exciting new programs. I think in Mike's opening remarks he mentioned fiscal year '26-'27. So, this is in our pharmaceutical business and our med device segment. And we like to say these programs are incredibly sticky. They last for many, many years of steady production, and we have great visibility with our customers. And what's also exciting is these are launching in some of our new factories, both in the Dominican Republic and Croatia. As a reminder, and again, Mike mentioned this, but the complexity of healthcare is really tied to the validation requirements, and then, you have the complexity of lead time for automation. So, new wins typically launch in cycles that are two to three years before you kind of reach that steady state production, but love where we're positioned in our healthcare business. The second part of your question, let me take that, which is the J&J question. There's -- certainly we remain positive. We've seen a strong pipeline that we're positioned on currently and it's at all different levels of discussions. And that's a really solid sign that our healthcare OEMs, they still view divestitures as a potential strategy for moving outsourcing faster. So, we'll see how those transpire over the year, but pipeline is really strong.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that, Steve. Mike, if I can squeeze another quick one in? Just looking at your global footprint, I mean, what is the current utilization? And you talked about an impact of 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Is there -- do you think that there's a need for any restructuring of the footprint? And which end markets do you see investing in over the next year? Thank you. Thanks for all the details.\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Ruplu. So, in my prepared remarks, I talked about how after the Mobility divestiture, our footprint is really well balanced, it's one-third in the Americas, one-third in Europe, one-third in Asia. Currently, our capacity is set up for a $30 billion-plus revenue run rate. We've got new facilities in Croatia coming up. We've got new facilities in Dominican Republic coming up. So, there's a whole bunch of sort of capacity that was put into play. So, it was put in place to come up in '25. So, the utilization that we have today, normally, we run around 80% to 85%. Our utilization today is closer to the 70% level. And that creates obviously, a surplus capacity issue. One of the things we're not doing. And then again, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, one thing we're definitely not doing is going in and restructure or reduce the number of sites, because we believe, and this is a very strong belief, that the end markets that we're in will come back. We feel EVs will come back. We know healthcare will be steady eddy. The growth that we're seeing in semi cap, the growth that we're seeing in the cloud data center infrastructure parts of the business, we're well-positioned for that. When that business comes back, by the way, there will be a decent level of leverage. So, 20 basis points, 30 basis points that I talked about, that is a headwind right now. So, we're not restructuring capacity. I think, we did disclose this morning that we're sort of restructuring some of the SG&A piece, the headcount piece. If you think of the $3 billion or $4 billion gap that we've had in our revenue, 3% of that is, around $100 million, in SG&A. So, we're trying to address some of that. At the end of the day, we're marching to 6%. If we can get our gross margins in that 9.4%, 9.5% range and get our SG&A down to that same 3.4%, 3.5%, you have a 6% margin. It's just pure math. So, that's what we're trying to do here, but we strongly believe that the businesses that we're in, they will come back. So, no restructuring of capacity at this stage.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just -- first of all, I just want to ask about capital equipment. Obviously, it's cyclical, as you guys mentioned, but almost 20% growth stood out to me. Just curious if you can hone in a little bit, just talk about the driver behind it. Is this a new win or just say easy compare? Just kind of curious about this strong double-digit growth for the semi-cap for this year.\nMike Dastoor: Matt, do you want to take that?\nMatt Crowley: Yeah, I'll take that one. Hey, George, thanks for the question. Yeah, we're definitely seeing some mix shift occurring in the business in our automated test equipment space, because I think there is a pretty clear attach rate there to some of the GPU silicon required to drive AI. So, where customers are trying to get more capacity and more yield out the door for customers, we've seen an increase around demand for the ATE business. I think that's the primary driver. We're also seeing a bit of the recovery coming a little bit sooner than we expected on the WFE side. So, overall, I think that the ATE business and the attach rate to AI is a big part of that increase.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Just a quick follow-up. Can you kind of expand and talk about kind of margin for the AI business? Margin seems to be the focal point for investors, kind of, as you guy said high-grade portfolio, fast growing AI cloud business with higher margin. Just how you think about also kind of liquid cooling, kind of OSAT and silicon photonics, potentially higher margin? And quickly, just curious, since you guys re-segmented, not sure if we can still reconcile to this $6 billion AI revenue you guys talked about a couple quarters ago. Besides this cloud and DCI, maybe there's some in the AI networking. So, just curious whether does it still sort of a valid number we should look at kind of from grow by $1 billion to $6 billion this year, or should we just stick to a new sort of disclose of segmentation of $5.1 billion for the current DCI for this year? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Yeah, no, thanks. Look, I think, in general, an easy way to think about margins is that we expect AI margins to be in-line to slightly accretive to the enterprise targets that we've laid out. We're currently, obviously, undergoing a number of ramps. And the way to think about the $6 billion is that it's spread across cloud and DCI, capital equipment and networking. So, as I just kind of illustrated, the ATE business as an attach rate there to AI, our networking business where we're helping customers transition from air-cooled to liquid-cooled switches has a clear attach rate, as well as, obviously, what we're doing in the data center for power and cooling. And so, I think the easy way to think about the $1 billion of incremental growth year-on-year is roughly half of it is being driven by our cloud and data center business, and then the other half is split relatively evenly between photonics and capital equipment.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good morning, and thanks for doing this call in the middle of a hurricane. I guess, just on the automotive and transport segment, the numbers in the quarter, at least the revenues were a little less than expected. Again, the guidance for the full year, this fiscal year, is down. So, in the near term, I'm wondering how much negative leverage that auto business is creating for you since I assume it's still high margin? And then, maybe more important, like if I think about this business longer term, I know it makes sense to think of further EV growth in the future, but there are a lot of dynamics out there that make you wonder about whether -- how the company is positioned in auto. If you could address whether these are good or bad for the -- for Jabil longer term? Mainly, we're seeing lower-cost vehicles out of China, we're seeing OEMs -- global OEMs having trouble competing in Asia, and you're seeing tariffs rise up all over the world, among other items. It just seems like the auto industry is going to go through some major changes, and I guess I'm wondering if Jabil is positioned well for that. And then, I had a follow-up.\nSteve Borges: Thanks, Steve. This is Steve. We kind of hit this at a kind of a broad level and then we can -- if you need to dial in further, let me know. But I think, as I said in the opening remarks, it is going through kind of a transition phase or transformation phase in the auto market. And it has been hampered by higher interest rates, the government incentives, in many cases, have been reduced, and then you have, like, as you mentioned, the overall tariff situation. So, it's been pretty dynamic. And we've seen some pushouts of programs that we had thought about for this fiscal year. But when you take a look at the general consumer challenges as well with the charging infrastructure concerns and battery range, you kind of sit back and you say, geez, there's some challenges ahead. And what I'll say though is despite the challenges, I actually remain pretty excited about the EV market because the growth -- you look at different forms of predictions, but still expected to be in the 25% to 30% range through 2030, albeit that's down from 48%, but that's still really strong growth. And I'd say between the growth rates and our ability to grow new relationships, we -- during this softness, we've added some new OEM relationships. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities. And I'd also say the team has done a really nice job during the softness where they've added other products that are agnostic to vehicle type. And that really shows the strength of our OEM relationships to try to use some of that capacity that we had in place to support their programs. And then, I'll just close with, in addition, we actually launched on time an OEM relationship in Croatia. And so, we're excited about that business as well.\nSteven Fox: Yeah, that's -- Steve, that covered pretty much everything except for the short term. I'm just -- maybe just now dial it back and talk about, like, the negative leverage this year as auto and transportation maybe are down a little bit.\nMike Dastoor: Let me answer that question, Steve. I think there's definitely some level of negative leverage there. As you're aware, our Croatia factory that was put up, that's coming online actually this month or in October, was mainly an automotive factory. Some of that has got pushed out. We're actually converting that Croatia factory mainly to a GLP-1, sort of healthcare factory just shows how nimble and agile someone like a Jabil can be. That's the beauty of the model here, but there is definitely going to be some level of negative leverage. The good thing is our revenue is not getting -- going down by 10%, 20%. It's just not going up. So, there's a little bit of deleveraging, but not so much. But there are definitely newer pieces of capacity that are coming online which are getting pushed out a little bit.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, the cash flow targets for this fiscal year are pretty impressive. Can you just walk through the puts and takes in terms of how we see free cash flow go up again towards that $1.2 billion number for the year? Thanks.\nGreg Hebard: Yeah. Hi, Steve, this is Greg. Yeah, we're very confident on the $1.2 billion guidance on free cash flow. As Mike spoke on in his remarks regarding free cash flow conversion of being 80% to 100% of core net income, we feel '25 is going to be stronger. A couple of things related to that. We are targeting to take another couple days of working capital out of the cash cycle. And CapEx, we're seeing CapEx being approximately $200 million down year-over-year as we're looking at 1.5% to 2% of CapEx of revenue this coming year. So, really do feel confident on that $1.2 billion.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. Thanks a lot, and stay safe.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Steve.\nGreg Hebard: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hey, guys, thanks so much. I hate to say it, but it seems like we're always running from a hurricane down here during your year-end calls. It'd be great if we could change that pattern. That would be fantastic. So, just to start, I love the new segmentation and all the detail that you're giving us. I think it gives us all much better visibility into the real drivers. So, thanks for that. Matt, you are the popular one on the call today, so I've got a question for you. Up and down the supply chain in the cloud and data center infrastructure supply chain, we've heard of increasing pricing pressure, both from Nvidia on their suppliers or attempts to protect the margins by the hyperscalers as the cost of these compute systems continue to skyrocket. I'm wondering if you're also seeing some pressure from your customers as they're more cost conscious when they're planning out their portfolios, or if this is actually an opportunity for Jabil as to maybe help consolidate the supply chain.\nMatt Crowley: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Melissa, for the question. What I would tell you is that we're constantly under price pressure, right? It's part of the business. So, is it a little bit more so than typical? Maybe, but it's something that we have to deal with on an ongoing basis. So, does it afford us an opportunity? Absolutely. And we're constantly looking at ways to consolidate. Are there opportunities in the market that we see that would create more value for our customers? We're constantly looking at that. I don't think it creates an opportunity beyond the typical one, though. So, it's an ongoing effort to manage costs. We'll continue to do it. We'll continue to look for efficiencies that deliver value for our customers, but it's nothing we're not used to.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe a quick one for Steve. So, in the healthcare business, I was wondering if we could get a quick update on the equipment side of things, like the surgical robotics, the imaging. You had mentioned, there's an uptick in GLPs, maybe offsetting some gastric bypass surgeries. Wondering how that's playing through your customers planning longer term.\nSteve Borges: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Melissa. So, certainly genomic testing is -- continues to increase where we can kind of get granular on the disease and how to treat it, and so we are seeing growth in our diagnostic space linked to that, which is really exciting. On the general GLP-1 side, as I mentioned before, we continue to see very strong growth in that area of the business. As it relates to the other equipment areas like med devices, I would say that we continue to see a growth rate of that 3% to 4% range currently as we grow in the diabetes area of the business. Robotic surgeries, obviously, is an area that we strategically invested in over the past several years. We've added new customers, and we continue to do more and more of the surgical equipment itself, which is exciting, gives us great diversification and capability expansion as well that can be used elsewhere. So, yeah, we really like where we're positioned there as well.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Perfect. Thanks. This may be a question for all of you, or Mike, maybe you can address this. It's something I've been getting asked about. I think I know the answer, but just in case. Wondering how your customers are approaching the upcoming election. If there's been any change in their ordering or planning, or even delays with some of their longer-term program planning?\nMike Dastoor: Yeah, Melissa, there is a little bit of a wait-and-see approach, particularly as it relates to some of the end markets. I think most end markets are okay. I think once that stand out, obviously, are EV's and renewables, there is a little bit of a wait and see. I do think whichever party comes in, I feel good that we'll have a long-term sort of growth driver in both EVs and renewables. I'm not that worried about the election per se. Obviously, there'll be short-term impact, but I think Jabil has mitigated most of that.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Great. Thanks. I think that's all for me, guys. Stay safe. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, again, guys, for taking everything, given the circumstances, and please stay safe. Maybe can I just start, maybe go to Matt, I know, Matt, you're answering a lot of questions, but I just want to get a better sense for not just on the cloud and data center side, but as it ties to networking and comms. Obviously, the networking and comms business ex the divestiture is still a little bit weak. How do we think about how those two different businesses kind of work together going forward in terms of demand drivers? And over the longer term, obviously, when we hear from a lot of investors, there's some concern or maybe some fear that there's a degree of digestion that could potentially happen over the longer term. I know you just gave '25 numbers, but just how do you think about your visibility across different programs and how that maybe plays into your long-term thinking about the segment? And then, I've got a couple more.\nMatt Crowley: Yeah, let me kind of take them from the back forward. So, if you think about visibility, we have a pretty unique position because we have customers across the entire spectrum of the ecosystem. And so, we have a pretty good view of what's happening at the folks who make silicon for AI, at the folks who then transform it and consume it. And so, we feel pretty good about where things are going. Now, if you think about digestion and you think about near term, we're currently in the midst of helping customers move from air cooled switching gear to liquid cooled switching gear. And so, we can also see the consumption of that on the back end. I think it's going to continue to take off as we move out of fiscal '25. If I address the question on how comms and networking works together, I would tell you, look, artificial intelligence is driving this massive wave in the market, that's probably having more of an impact on our networking business and our comms. And with the 5G installations where they are, which is pretty well publicized, I don't think they're as adjacent as they used to be, but certainly as workloads evolve and new opportunities to drive synergy between those, we'll be able to take advantage of that.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And maybe one for either Greg or Mike, whoever wants to take this. So, this is more on the model. When you kind of think about, obviously, making the adjustments for the divestitures, the Mobility piece, the $700 million that you referenced earlier, obviously, I think we're getting some questions about the back-half ramp that sort of implied from an EPS perspective given sort of the year-over-year comp in Q1 and, ultimately, what it probably looks like in Q2. I know you touched on it briefly, but can you kind of help us understand how we should think about utilization going into the second half? And is that the driver of margin expansion on the gross line, or is it really driven by this buyback? I'm just trying to get a sense for how the second half ramps. And is the buyback really going to be upwards of like $900 million in the fiscal year based on sort of piecing together the commentary about 80% of cash flow return to shareholders and your CapEx and upping sort of your free cash flow numbers?\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, David. I do think the 40-60 is critical. I think if you go back to our Mobility days, Q1 was always the big quarter and, Q2, sometimes was a bigger quarter, sometimes wasn't, depending on the Chinese New Year impact. So, Mobility coming out -- the bulk of our seasonality is sort of like an EMS seasonality. We do have some connected living business with our customer who used to be the largest customer and that seasonality does come down in the second quarter. So, there's a little bit of a mixed bag between the connected living, the EMS seasonality. So, I'll ask Andy to provide a little bit more color on the connected living piece first and then I'll jump back on after that.\nAndy Priestley: Yeah. Thanks, David. If you look at that connected living piece, we're seeing some muted demand through the consumer. We're taking a pretty conservative view of their demand picture, which I think is feeding into our overall numbers there. And then, as we contrast that with digital commerce, which is much more of a level profile, we're in a really good shape for the second half.\nMike Dastoor: And then, the second half, the margins, I think if you look at the EMS seasonality, our margins in EMS have always been higher in the second half of the year, so no major change there. The buyback at this stage, we're going to be very opportunistic, do buybacks as and when needed. We fully intend to use the $1 billion authorization that the Board just approved for us this morning. So, there's no -- obviously, that will help on the EPS side, but nothing unusual. We'll be just spreading it across the year and opportunistic as and when we feel like.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for all the help, and stay safe.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I have a follow-up first on the data center market. Matt, you mentioned Jabil has won business with two new hyperscaler customers. Can you elaborate on how broad-based those wins are? Does it include assembly and services for hardware and racks, or was it more specifically tied into optical? And anything you can share around the timing for when some of these new program wins ramp up?\nMatt Crowley: Yeah. Hey, thanks for the question, Mark. It is specific to optical, but it's an example of how our strategy is working as intended, right? The whole -- what we've attempted to do is create capabilities outside of our core, scaled out manufacturing that allow us to access customers in different ways. And so, while these wins with the two new hyperscalers are specific to our optical business, it gives us access to the hyperscalers to go and demonstrate that we can create value for them in all the other areas of our business. And obviously, with the mass adoption of folks who are trying to retrofit data centers to go from air to liquid, it puts us in a great position to have different conversations.\nMark Delaney: Okay, helpful. Thank you for that. My next question was a follow-up on how you thought about guiding fiscal '25 and more with respect to revenue in the back half of the year. I'm hoping to better understand to what extent you tried to factor in any conservatism in terms of your forecasting by end market. Given what happened last year with some of the volatility, I'm curious if you've changed your approach on how you're trying to factor in any potential market -- macroeconomic volatility.\nMike Dastoor: Hey, Mark, we have learnt our lessons from last year, and the second half that we have put in here is relatively booked business. There's no assumptions of a huge recovery in the end market. It's based off of seasonality. It's based off of our regular sort of wins that we have. Some of the wins take a little bit longer than others. There's multiple ramps going on. So, I feel good about the second half of the year. There's nothing in there that would suggest that there's some level of optimism there. It's a pretty conservative number as well.\nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And just lastly for me, and I'll turn it over. In terms of the EBIT margin outlook for fiscal '25 at 5.4%, Mike, you already spoke about the underutilization and how that's a factor year-on-year, but could you go into a bit more depth around any effect on -- from pricing and how this may be factoring into margin guidance for this year? Curious to better understand if there's been any change in the broader pricing landscape given some cyclical weakness that we're seeing in some of the end markets and if that's at all a factor in your guidance. Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: Yeah. I'm not seeing any major pricing issues. I think the whole industry is doing really well from that perspective. I think it's just a matter of the surplus capacity that we're carrying today. And I talked about that. It's about 20 basis points, 30 basis points, nothing more than that. So, it's sort of -- it's not more than what we're saying, to be fair.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Thanks so much, and wishing you all the best with the hurricane.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, and thanks for all the information so far. My question regarding that exit of your major networking customer. The first question is, is that revenue all out of the model? And in terms of balance sheet receivables and cash flow from that, was that mostly a Q4 or are we going to see some of that in Q1? And then, on sort of bigger picture, obviously, it's a big step for you to exit from a customer that you've had for 20-plus years. And I know the industry, a lot of your peers have also been disciplined walking away from major revenue opportunities, looking at returns and margins. So, question is, have you looked at other relationships in terms of your portfolio back to customers? And is this sort of giving you a little bit more leverage with customers in terms of pricing and returns as you look at forward contracts? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Yeah, Matt, the walking away from a customer, where -- I think I've said it a number of times, for the last six years, we've been focused fully on margins, we've been focused on free cash flows, and we're looking at earnings and return to shareholders. If customers -- we never sort of walk away from them directly. We try to negotiate a price, and if the price doesn't work out, that's when we disengage. So, there's no walking away from customers, but there's definitely a disengagement going on there. As regards to your question on, is it all done? It is all done. I think we call it out on our slide. There was about $700 million of revenue with the legacy network customer in '24. That will not repeat in '25 at all. And all the balance sheet items have also been closed. So, we have a nice amount of sort of separation after 31st of August.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, thank you for that. And then, just a follow-up on the end markets. Your renewable energy and infrastructure, it looks like you're actually guiding for growth. And I know we've heard -- I mean, you've had headwinds, certainly in the demand front and so have your peers. So, what's behind that forecast for seeing at least modest growth next year?\nSteve Borges: Sure. This is Steve. I'll take the question. Yeah, renewables is slightly up as we've been able to get some new wins in the HVAC space and battery storage. And then, with the IRA and its impact, we've been able to -- in our U.S. footprint, obviously, being well-positioned, has given us some opportunities there as well to ramp some new programs. So that's where it's coming from. We are not -- as Mike said, not looking for a solar residential or commercial rebound in the fiscal year, keeping that flat, but the growth is really coming from some new wins.\nMike Dastoor: And there's some consolidation going on in that end market as well and we've been the beneficiary of that. And it's directly related to the IRA piece that Steve referenced.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. All right, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan Chase & Company. Your line is now live.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, and thank you for hosting the call under the circumstances, I wanted to start with a margin question more in relation to Mike, your prepared remarks, and the reiteration of the 6% margin target that you have. I'm just trying to think in terms of if you have any updated thoughts around what's the revenue scale that you need to get to that margin number. I know you're calling out about 20 basis points, 30 basis points to the 5.4% for fiscal '25, which implies that you'll still be at sort of 5.6%, 5.7% underlying sort of -- if you get to a $30 billion capacity or utilization of the $30 billion capacity. So, just trying to think like what do you need in excess of that $30 billion, how do you think about what scale you need to get to that margin target? Thank you. And I have a follow-up.\nMike Dastoor: I think between $30 billion and $35 billion would get us there. I think what I've said before is gross margins are 9% to 10%. So, if you can just mathematically get to that 9.5% on a gross margin, and you can do that with mix and you can do that with operational efficiencies. If you get to the 9.5% -- and by the way, we've hit 9.5% in the past. In fact, I think Q4 was 9.3% -- for the year...\nGreg Hebard: 9.3% for the year.\nMike Dastoor: Yeah. So, 9.5% is not a target, that's out five, six years. We've done that in the past. And then, getting SG&A down to that 3.5% number, I think would get us to the 6% pretty fast. I'm not suggesting we'll get to 6% in the next one or two years, but I'm also not suggesting we'll get there in five or 10 years. It's going to be somewhere in the [202X] (ph) timeframe and we'll have a definite path to that 6%. I feel really good about that.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And for my follow-up, I guess, it's sort of probably a question for you, again, Mike, in terms of the strategy update that you provided, no major changes, focusing more on profitable growth. As you think about sort of your portfolio and the opportunity to sort of keep expanding margins, should we be expecting some level of portfolio rationalization sort of happening every year, or sort of a continuous look at the portfolio to sort of weed out some of the lower-margin businesses and continue to drive the mix higher, or is this the biggest chunk in terms of what's coming out in fiscal '25, and everything beyond that should be really immaterial in that sense? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: Over time, Samik, we normally have those sort of portfolio rationalizations anyways. The reason we call this one out was because it was a material one. We have smaller rationalizations going on all the time where we try and get a negative customer back into positive territory and then beyond. If it works well for both of us, we continue. If not, we help them transition somewhere else. But overall, I'm not expecting some big rationalization exercises to take place. I'm relatively happy with what I'm seeing today from a portfolio perspective. Don't forget, some of the customers that have a slightly lower margin have really good free cash flow. So, it's not just about margin, it's a mixed story between free cash flow and margin. And we're constantly working that. One thing I will say, over the last few years and especially since COVID, the value proposition that Jabil provides has gone up considerably. I think if you look at our engineering capabilities, if you look at our manufacturing facilities, particularly with all these geopolitical issues going on, and then you look at our supply chain, which came through very strongly during COVID, I think pricing is not that much of an issue, obviously, every customer will negotiate pricing, but I do think the value proposition that Jabil provides is extremely strong today, and I think that continues in the future as well. So, the portfolio rationalization will be there, but limited.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And I'll just sneak one in. This is a follow-up to the question David asked you on the sort of ramp through the year. You do have revenue that's relatively sort of flattish through the rest of the year in terms of the implied implicit sort of annualized run rate here, but you're starting off the first quarter with 5.1% margin and implicitly you have to end somewhere in the high 5%s in the fourth quarter to get to the full year of 5.4%. What is the driver there? I think you said some -- you answered it, but I didn't really catch what you were implying. Is it mix, is it something else that's really driving that margin to sort of end up being in the high 5%s by the time you end -- exit the year?\nMike Dastoor: So, there's two or three things. First is the normal EMS seasonality. If you go back and look over the past few years, the second half, from a margin standpoint and an earnings standpoint, has always been stronger. Part of it is mix. I think the mix that we're working on today, particularly in some of the regulated pieces, you have businesses coming through six months, nine months, 12 months out. Second half is looking good. I don't have anything in the second half which is exploratory. Sort of this is booked business, this is confirmed. Will it go up and down a little bit? Sure, but it's not based off of an optimistic return of end markets perspective. It's a conservative forecast. It's just the way the 40-60s working out. It's purely a seasonality, purely the way the bookings are, purely mix. That's how we're getting some leverage on that as well. And that's why you'll see second half is a little bit better than the first half.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike Dastoor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Jabil. We look forward to getting back with you all over the next couple days, and we'll see you soon. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Matt Crowley",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm excited to share some insights into our work in the Intelligent Infrastructure segment and discuss the evolution of cloud technology cycles, including the transformative impact of artificial intelligence. Our segment is dedicated to developing and delivering cutting-edge solutions that support the backbone of the modern digital ecosystem. This includes everything from cloud and data center infrastructure to telecommunications, networking and capital equipment. Each of these end markets plays a crucial role in shaping the future of how we connect, compute and communicate. The evolution of digital technology has laid a robust foundation for today's advancements. Starting with e-commerce in the '90s, moving through Web 2.0 in the early 2000s, and advancing with cloud computing, mobile apps and big data in the early 2010s, each phase has been pivotal. Now, we're on the cusp of a new era. Thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning. These emerging technologies promise to reshape everything in our lives, from solving major health conditions to seamless autonomous transportation, emphasizing the critical role of cloud infrastructure as an enabler to these innovations. AI is the next cloud technology cycle, revolutionizing the way we process and analyze data, enabling more intelligent and automated decision making. At Jabil, we're at the center of this evolution, providing our customers with advanced manufacturing solutions, they need to stay competitive in a rapidly changing landscape. Our expertise in this segment allows us to support the development and deployment of next-generation technologies to the market. The journey to fully harness AI comes with its own set of challenges that spur innovation and investment. Old compute architectures are inefficient for new models, necessitating the development of massive parallel architectures that drive huge data transfer needs. Additionally, AI requires immense amounts of energy. As processing power demands continue to exceed the capabilities of conventional cooling methods, there's an increase in need for advanced liquid cooling solutions. While liquid cooling has been around for many years, it has traditionally been a way to deliver efficiency. With the explosion of AI and the high-power GPUs required to fuel it, liquid cooling is now a requirement to deliver capacity and will soon be the standard for how data centers address cooling. The pace of innovation associated with today's GPU silicon is twice as fast as legacy silicon architectures. This creates new challenges when launching products from development into production. In our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, Jabil has built engineering and architecture capabilities that allow us to enable this transition of hardware from development to production at scale, while also enabling us to keep pace with the accelerated development cycles we see being driven in the market today. Additionally, as GPU speeds increase, so does the need for high bandwidth interconnect, driving the need for cost and power-efficient photonic interconnect. Across all of these technologies, we are actively investing in capabilities that offer our customers differentiated value for solutions that meet these emerging requirements. One specific example of differentiated capability is our recently announced investment in Jabil's advanced packaging OSAT and process development facility for photonics. This technology will become more important over time, as power continues to become more scarce and the need for higher speed and lower latency inside systems becomes more important. Our investments in this space positions Jabil to be at the center of one of the next innovation cycles, as the industry moves to co-packaged optics and on-chip solutions. In addition to our focus on creating these key capabilities, we're also expanding our footprint in strategic geographies as we scale our support of AI data center buildouts. Our facility in Pune, India, is a key manufacturing site for our AI customers and has executed exceptionally well. And while our demand for manufacturing in India has been driven by AI-related hardware requirements, Jabil has customers across all three of our segments asking us to leverage the region. Because of this, we have recently announced our intention to further expand our footprint in the country. The unique capabilities we have built throughout this technology value chain are core to a strategy that is both agile and resilient, giving Jabil the ability to support massive scale from secular tailwinds like AI, while being ready for whatever comes next in the market. Ultimately, Jabil is a key player within the technology ecosystem, ready to help customers overcome today's challenges and prepare for tomorrow. We're leveraging our expertise to support the increasing demand for advanced processors, high-speed photonics and sophisticated hardware solutions. Our solutions are designed to be scalable, secure and adaptable, helping our customers to stay ahead. I'll now pass it along to Andy to speak about the Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment. Yeah. Hey, thanks, Mike, and appreciate the question, Ruplu. Let me kind of focus on the back half of your question around our plans to expand the segment beyond our existing customers. So, we are hyper-focused on executing the strategy that we've put in place over the past 18 months. And a good proof point of that is our silicon photonics business. If you think back to last November, we announced a transaction that brought in capability and capacity. And inside of the first 12 months, we've already seen that pay off, in that we have now landed business with two new hyperscale accounts, which we're currently shipping product into. So, we're hyper-focused on executing there. We believe that our roadmap moving forward on the qualification of 800-gig parts as well as 1.6T, coming in calendar year '25, will allow us to continue to expand our customer base there. We're also super-focused on executing our power and cooling business in the data center. We're currently beginning to ramp our ability to help customers retrofit data centers, which today are air cooled, need to be retrofitted to go from air to liquid, and soon will be liquid to liquid. So, we really feel like the capabilities we've built over the past 18 months in these spaces is going to allow us to continue to expand the customer base. And we've already seen some really nice proof points of that to-date. Yeah, I'll take that one. Hey, George, thanks for the question. Yeah, we're definitely seeing some mix shift occurring in the business in our automated test equipment space, because I think there is a pretty clear attach rate there to some of the GPU silicon required to drive AI. So, where customers are trying to get more capacity and more yield out the door for customers, we've seen an increase around demand for the ATE business. I think that's the primary driver. We're also seeing a bit of the recovery coming a little bit sooner than we expected on the WFE side. So, overall, I think that the ATE business and the attach rate to AI is a big part of that increase. Yeah. Hey, thanks, Melissa, for the question. What I would tell you is that we're constantly under price pressure, right? It's part of the business. So, is it a little bit more so than typical? Maybe, but it's something that we have to deal with on an ongoing basis. So, does it afford us an opportunity? Absolutely. And we're constantly looking at ways to consolidate. Are there opportunities in the market that we see that would create more value for our customers? We're constantly looking at that. I don't think it creates an opportunity beyond the typical one, though. So, it's an ongoing effort to manage costs. We'll continue to do it. We'll continue to look for efficiencies that deliver value for our customers, but it's nothing we're not used to. Yeah, let me kind of take them from the back forward. So, if you think about visibility, we have a pretty unique position because we have customers across the entire spectrum of the ecosystem. And so, we have a pretty good view of what's happening at the folks who make silicon for AI, at the folks who then transform it and consume it. And so, we feel pretty good about where things are going. Now, if you think about digestion and you think about near term, we're currently in the midst of helping customers move from air cooled switching gear to liquid cooled switching gear. And so, we can also see the consumption of that on the back end. I think it's going to continue to take off as we move out of fiscal '25. If I address the question on how comms and networking works together, I would tell you, look, artificial intelligence is driving this massive wave in the market, that's probably having more of an impact on our networking business and our comms. And with the 5G installations where they are, which is pretty well publicized, I don't think they're as adjacent as they used to be, but certainly as workloads evolve and new opportunities to drive synergy between those, we'll be able to take advantage of that. Yeah. Hey, thanks for the question, Mark. It is specific to optical, but it's an example of how our strategy is working as intended, right? The whole -- what we've attempted to do is create capabilities outside of our core, scaled out manufacturing that allow us to access customers in different ways. And so, while these wins with the two new hyperscalers are specific to our optical business, it gives us access to the hyperscalers to go and demonstrate that we can create value for them in all the other areas of our business. And obviously, with the mass adoption of folks who are trying to retrofit data centers to go from air to liquid, it puts us in a great position to have different conversations."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Over the last three months, I've had the opportunity to travel to a number of our sites and spend a lot of time on the shop floor with our teams. Let me address a question that understandingly came up a number of times in my travels, and which I believe many of you on the call have as well. I'm often asked, \"Mike, are you going to change the strategy? What are you going to do differently?\" Well, our enterprise-level strategy is sound and, while I have made some changes to focus the organization more on profitable growth while also reducing risk, I will largely maintain the same direction that has allowed us to be so successful for the past few years. Our diversified approach across multiple end markets with secular trends continues to provide a solid foundation. This approach was pressure tested in FY '24, as we faced multiple headwinds across several end markets and still delivered strong margins and free cash flow. Today, the company is much more resilient than in years past. During my first few months as CEO, I've spent considerable time ensuring we have the right people leading our three distinct businesses. Each of these businesses has a different growth expectation, lead time, margin and balance sheet profile, outsourcing maturity levels and product lifecycle times. It was imperative to ensure our teams remain focused in their respective areas of domain expertise. Based on what I've seen in the last three months, I feel like we've gotten that part right. We have three business leaders in Steve, Matt and Andy that have the tenure and experience in Jabil, solid pedigree, deep domain expertise and know-how to run a global manufacturing business at scale. I also believe we have the right team running our factories, led by Fred McCoy, another nearly 25-year Jabil employee. Fred's unique combination of commercial experience and manufacturing operations will allow us to be more agile and more efficient as the complexities of manufacturing continue to grow. And finally, our supply chain organization is in exceptional hands with Frank McKay. Frank has developed a highly-experienced, long-tenured team with extremely strong relationships in the supply chain over the last 25 years, which, along with investments and advanced supply chain systems, gives me full confidence that Jabil continues to be best-in-class in the industry. This well-rounded enterprise leadership team is already delivering results, securing new business across each of our distinct segments. In Regulated Industries, Jabil continues to partner with global market-leading automotive OEMs, offsetting EV demand softness with new wins, particularly as tariffs dictate the localized manufacturing of vehicles. In healthcare, we will soon be expanding our GLP-1 drug delivery business in Europe, through new wins with existing customers. We've taken our manufacturing and automation and industrialization capabilities designed in the U.S. market and replicated those efforts in Europe, which we believe will result in solid multiyear growth. We've also recently won new programs in the diabetes wearables area. As mentioned earlier, lead times on new wins in the healthcare space due to medical validation requirements means these wins only show up in FY '26 and FY '27. In Intelligent Infrastructure, our team is squarely situated at the center of the data center infrastructure backbone. We lead with design and engineering to build the hardware and infrastructure that will enable artificial intelligence. Jabil is also well-positioned to participate in the recovery of the capital equipment end market during our fiscal '25. Year-on-year, we expect the Intelligent Infrastructure segment to be up by $1 billion after adjusting for the exit of legacy networking businesses Greg mentioned earlier. In Connected Lifestyle & Digital Commerce, our team is driving innovative solutions to address our customers' desire to automate their warehouse and retail environments as labor becomes increasingly difficult to find. As we move through FY '25, our digital commerce business will grow, as we have won new programs with both new and existing customers in that space. Also, while early days, the robot and humanoid end market seems to be evolving rapidly, and Jabil is currently participating in that. At Jabil, we build staff, leveraging our vast engineering capabilities, global footprint and long-term partnerships. Technologies constantly evolve, but Jabil will continue to skate to the park by investing in engineering-led tuck-in capabilities which will allow Jabil to be technology agnostic. For instance, in the automotive sector, Jabil has built engineering capabilities that are equipped to support both hybrid and EV platforms, depending on which one prevails. In the data center infrastructure space, Jabil has built engineering and architecture capabilities that allow us to keep pace with the accelerated development cycles and transition from older computer architecture to GPU-led system level design and hardware production at scale. This, along with our investments in OSAT and power management engineering capabilities, means we're in a good position to offer our customers differentiated value for the solutions that meet the ever evolving requirements in this space. Similarly, in the digital commerce space, Jabil's advanced automation engineering investments uniquely position us to provide automation solutions across various fields, including retail warehouses and robots. Transitioning to our financial priorities and unique approach to the market, it's important to highlight that both will remain consistent. Six years ago, we deliberately refocused our organization with the intention of achieving core operating margin expansion, consistent earnings growth at robust predictable cash flows. To this end, we align the management compensation metrics to better match investor expectations. None of this changes. And importantly, our capital allocation framework continues to be aimed at creating long-term value for shareholders. And when it comes to our approach with customers, we utilize customer-centric work sales that are focused on supporting a single customer. This approach is highly effective and sets us apart from competitors. Regardless of the customers manufacturing location worldwide, a dedicated team supports them across the three regions in Asia, the Americas and Europe. Each work cell provides tailored solutions in three key areas of expertise, advanced engineering-led engagements, AI, ML supported manufacturing solutions, and robust supply chain systems. Currently, around 70% of our engagements are led by engineering initiatives. The complexities of modern supply chains and geopolitical challenges, along with the need for advanced software solutions and manufacturing closer to the end market have significantly enhanced Jabil's value proposition. This increased engagement means enhanced stickiness and margin improvement compared to even five or six years ago. And when you look a level deeper within each of our segments, you'll find an exceptionally diverse array of customers, including some of the world's biggest, most innovative and successful brands. This is by no means a complete list of the customers we serve today, but it's certainly impressive by any standard, especially when considering many of our customers rely on Jabil as the sole source for their products. Now, let's discuss our global footprint, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage. To be abundantly clear, we place considerable value on maintaining a large-scale global manufacturing footprint. However, as the geopolitical situation continues to evolve, our ability to adapt, combined with our designation as a U.S. domiciled manufacturing service provider, is becoming increasingly important as we help our customers navigate this complexity. Following the divestiture of our Mobility business, our footprint has become largely balanced with nearly one-third of our factories located in each of the Americas, Europe and Asia. Over time, we believe there will be further demand for manufacturing that resides closer to the end customer. And for that reason, we will work with our customers that seek to near or re-shore their manufacturing, whether it be a bifurcated approach or simply lift and shift. As this dynamic plays out, I believe our factories in both Europe and the Americas will see considerable growth. Today, we have approximately 40 sites in North America, approximately 30 of which are in the U.S., ready to take advantage of any near or reshoring to North America. With that said, a lot of the world's supply chain is still very much embedded in Asia, and some of our most efficient factories are located there. As we sit today, we currently have capacity in place to support an excess of $30 billion of revenue. Over the near term in FY '25, we expect to carry higher than normal levels of excess capacity. We are doing this because we firmly believe many of the end markets we serve will recover. This underutilized capacity will weigh on core operating margins in FY '25 by 20 basis points to 30 basis points, even after the mainly headcount-related restructuring charges we disclosed this morning. Over the longer term, my team and I strongly believe we're well-positioned to capitalize on significant global trends in sectors such as AI, data center infrastructure, healthcare, pharmaceutical solutions, and warehouse automation, as Steve, Matt and Andy highlighted. As a result, Regulated Industries will grow 5% to 8% with longer lead times, while Intelligent Infrastructure will grow more quickly at 7% to 10%. Over the next several years, we believe Connected Living & Digital Commerce will grow low-to-mid single digits, driven mainly by double-digit growth in digital commerce and warehouse automation. Putting this all together, we believe our long-term enterprise growth rate should be in the range of 5% to 7%. Given this anticipated mix of business, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 9% to 10%. And when combined with operational efficiencies, our 6% margin target remains intact over the longer-term. And when you consider our strong free cash flow generation and consistent returns to shareholders, core EPS should grow between 12% to 15% over the longer term, all of which would continue to drive consistent ROIC north of 30%. In closing, one thing is for sure, it is our people who make us strong. Our people are resilient. So, I just want to take a moment to say thank you to all our employees for their unwavering commitment and dedication, not just to our customers, but also to our communities and to each other. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Jabil story. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call back over to Adam. Hey, Ruplu, it's Mike. So, I'll start off, and then I'll hand it over to Matt to provide some more details. But before I start, I just want to thank the whole team here. There's a hurricane blowing outside. We were all hunkered down in the office to do this call, so thanks to the team. As regards to Intelligent Infrastructure, you're absolutely right, year-on-year, we're seeing, I think, the growth rate is about 12% if you back out the legacy network customer that we disengage with. We talked about it on the last call. I talked about it again on this call. So, I think it's a 12% growth rate year-on-year. Now, I'd like to remind you the Intelligent Infrastructure also has 5G in it and it has a cyclical semi-cap business as well. And obviously, in the up years, the semi-cap business will do well. In the down years, it will not. So, overall, if you look at the year-on-year increase, extremely valid over the long-term 7% to 10%, still extremely strong given the other parts of the business that are in this segment as well. So, I'll hand the call over -- I think, from a consignment, by the way, the impact is very small and I think the business that I'm most excited about and that Matt is most excited about is the whole data center infrastructure business that will continue to grow, and I expect that to grow in double-digits as well. Matt, if you want to just take the rest of the question? Hey, Ruplu. So, in my prepared remarks, I talked about how after the Mobility divestiture, our footprint is really well balanced, it's one-third in the Americas, one-third in Europe, one-third in Asia. Currently, our capacity is set up for a $30 billion-plus revenue run rate. We've got new facilities in Croatia coming up. We've got new facilities in Dominican Republic coming up. So, there's a whole bunch of sort of capacity that was put into play. So, it was put in place to come up in '25. So, the utilization that we have today, normally, we run around 80% to 85%. Our utilization today is closer to the 70% level. And that creates obviously, a surplus capacity issue. One of the things we're not doing. And then again, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, one thing we're definitely not doing is going in and restructure or reduce the number of sites, because we believe, and this is a very strong belief, that the end markets that we're in will come back. We feel EVs will come back. We know healthcare will be steady eddy. The growth that we're seeing in semi cap, the growth that we're seeing in the cloud data center infrastructure parts of the business, we're well-positioned for that. When that business comes back, by the way, there will be a decent level of leverage. So, 20 basis points, 30 basis points that I talked about, that is a headwind right now. So, we're not restructuring capacity. I think, we did disclose this morning that we're sort of restructuring some of the SG&A piece, the headcount piece. If you think of the $3 billion or $4 billion gap that we've had in our revenue, 3% of that is, around $100 million, in SG&A. So, we're trying to address some of that. At the end of the day, we're marching to 6%. If we can get our gross margins in that 9.4%, 9.5% range and get our SG&A down to that same 3.4%, 3.5%, you have a 6% margin. It's just pure math. So, that's what we're trying to do here, but we strongly believe that the businesses that we're in, they will come back. So, no restructuring of capacity at this stage. Matt, do you want to take that? Yeah, no, thanks. Look, I think, in general, an easy way to think about margins is that we expect AI margins to be in-line to slightly accretive to the enterprise targets that we've laid out. We're currently, obviously, undergoing a number of ramps. And the way to think about the $6 billion is that it's spread across cloud and DCI, capital equipment and networking. So, as I just kind of illustrated, the ATE business as an attach rate there to AI, our networking business where we're helping customers transition from air-cooled to liquid-cooled switches has a clear attach rate, as well as, obviously, what we're doing in the data center for power and cooling. And so, I think the easy way to think about the $1 billion of incremental growth year-on-year is roughly half of it is being driven by our cloud and data center business, and then the other half is split relatively evenly between photonics and capital equipment. Let me answer that question, Steve. I think there's definitely some level of negative leverage there. As you're aware, our Croatia factory that was put up, that's coming online actually this month or in October, was mainly an automotive factory. Some of that has got pushed out. We're actually converting that Croatia factory mainly to a GLP-1, sort of healthcare factory just shows how nimble and agile someone like a Jabil can be. That's the beauty of the model here, but there is definitely going to be some level of negative leverage. The good thing is our revenue is not getting -- going down by 10%, 20%. It's just not going up. So, there's a little bit of deleveraging, but not so much. But there are definitely newer pieces of capacity that are coming online which are getting pushed out a little bit. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, Melissa, there is a little bit of a wait-and-see approach, particularly as it relates to some of the end markets. I think most end markets are okay. I think once that stand out, obviously, are EV's and renewables, there is a little bit of a wait and see. I do think whichever party comes in, I feel good that we'll have a long-term sort of growth driver in both EVs and renewables. I'm not that worried about the election per se. Obviously, there'll be short-term impact, but I think Jabil has mitigated most of that. Thanks, David. I do think the 40-60 is critical. I think if you go back to our Mobility days, Q1 was always the big quarter and, Q2, sometimes was a bigger quarter, sometimes wasn't, depending on the Chinese New Year impact. So, Mobility coming out -- the bulk of our seasonality is sort of like an EMS seasonality. We do have some connected living business with our customer who used to be the largest customer and that seasonality does come down in the second quarter. So, there's a little bit of a mixed bag between the connected living, the EMS seasonality. So, I'll ask Andy to provide a little bit more color on the connected living piece first and then I'll jump back on after that. And then, the second half, the margins, I think if you look at the EMS seasonality, our margins in EMS have always been higher in the second half of the year, so no major change there. The buyback at this stage, we're going to be very opportunistic, do buybacks as and when needed. We fully intend to use the $1 billion authorization that the Board just approved for us this morning. So, there's no -- obviously, that will help on the EPS side, but nothing unusual. We'll be just spreading it across the year and opportunistic as and when we feel like. Thank you. Hey, Mark, we have learnt our lessons from last year, and the second half that we have put in here is relatively booked business. There's no assumptions of a huge recovery in the end market. It's based off of seasonality. It's based off of our regular sort of wins that we have. Some of the wins take a little bit longer than others. There's multiple ramps going on. So, I feel good about the second half of the year. There's nothing in there that would suggest that there's some level of optimism there. It's a pretty conservative number as well. Yeah. I'm not seeing any major pricing issues. I think the whole industry is doing really well from that perspective. I think it's just a matter of the surplus capacity that we're carrying today. And I talked about that. It's about 20 basis points, 30 basis points, nothing more than that. So, it's sort of -- it's not more than what we're saying, to be fair. Thank you. Yeah, Matt, the walking away from a customer, where -- I think I've said it a number of times, for the last six years, we've been focused fully on margins, we've been focused on free cash flows, and we're looking at earnings and return to shareholders. If customers -- we never sort of walk away from them directly. We try to negotiate a price, and if the price doesn't work out, that's when we disengage. So, there's no walking away from customers, but there's definitely a disengagement going on there. As regards to your question on, is it all done? It is all done. I think we call it out on our slide. There was about $700 million of revenue with the legacy network customer in '24. That will not repeat in '25 at all. And all the balance sheet items have also been closed. So, we have a nice amount of sort of separation after 31st of August. And there's some consolidation going on in that end market as well and we've been the beneficiary of that. And it's directly related to the IRA piece that Steve referenced. I think between $30 billion and $35 billion would get us there. I think what I've said before is gross margins are 9% to 10%. So, if you can just mathematically get to that 9.5% on a gross margin, and you can do that with mix and you can do that with operational efficiencies. If you get to the 9.5% -- and by the way, we've hit 9.5% in the past. In fact, I think Q4 was 9.3% -- for the year... Yeah. So, 9.5% is not a target, that's out five, six years. We've done that in the past. And then, getting SG&A down to that 3.5% number, I think would get us to the 6% pretty fast. I'm not suggesting we'll get to 6% in the next one or two years, but I'm also not suggesting we'll get there in five or 10 years. It's going to be somewhere in the [202X] (ph) timeframe and we'll have a definite path to that 6%. I feel really good about that. Over time, Samik, we normally have those sort of portfolio rationalizations anyways. The reason we call this one out was because it was a material one. We have smaller rationalizations going on all the time where we try and get a negative customer back into positive territory and then beyond. If it works well for both of us, we continue. If not, we help them transition somewhere else. But overall, I'm not expecting some big rationalization exercises to take place. I'm relatively happy with what I'm seeing today from a portfolio perspective. Don't forget, some of the customers that have a slightly lower margin have really good free cash flow. So, it's not just about margin, it's a mixed story between free cash flow and margin. And we're constantly working that. One thing I will say, over the last few years and especially since COVID, the value proposition that Jabil provides has gone up considerably. I think if you look at our engineering capabilities, if you look at our manufacturing facilities, particularly with all these geopolitical issues going on, and then you look at our supply chain, which came through very strongly during COVID, I think pricing is not that much of an issue, obviously, every customer will negotiate pricing, but I do think the value proposition that Jabil provides is extremely strong today, and I think that continues in the future as well. So, the portfolio rationalization will be there, but limited. So, there's two or three things. First is the normal EMS seasonality. If you go back and look over the past few years, the second half, from a margin standpoint and an earnings standpoint, has always been stronger. Part of it is mix. I think the mix that we're working on today, particularly in some of the regulated pieces, you have businesses coming through six months, nine months, 12 months out. Second half is looking good. I don't have anything in the second half which is exploratory. Sort of this is booked business, this is confirmed. Will it go up and down a little bit? Sure, but it's not based off of an optimistic return of end markets perspective. It's a conservative forecast. It's just the way the 40-60s working out. It's purely a seasonality, purely the way the bookings are, purely mix. That's how we're getting some leverage on that as well. And that's why you'll see second half is a little bit better than the first half. Thank you."

            "name": "Andy Priestley",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Hello, everyone. I lead Jabil's Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment. Today, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk to you about our work in digital commerce and more specifically warehouse automation. When we think about the definition of commerce, it's the exchange of goods and services, especially on a large scale. Commerce is made possible by production and fulfillment. And at Jabil, we are a critical enabler within that ecosystem. Jabil is the largest manufacturing solutions provider for digital commerce and warehouse automation customers. Our expertise and scale allow us to support the largest players in this industry as they navigate the complexities of digitization and automation. Leaders in this market are focused on digitization. In the aisles, electronic shelf labels and other connected technologies are becoming part of a unified commerce strategy. These innovations are transforming the shopping experience, making it more seamless and efficient for the consumer and allowing a higher standard of compliance for the retailer. At the checkout, most shoppers are now using contactless payments. Jabil is a leading provider of point of sale and self-checkout solutions, having over 15 years of experience building and now designing these products. This shift in technology not only enhances convenience, but also aligns with the growing demand for safer, touch-free interactions. Additionally, research shows that most consumers today are likely to choose a business that offers grab-and-go services over a more traditional business model, highlighting the importance of speed and convenience in the modern retail landscape. Another element of the digital commerce system that may not be as immediately visible or apparent is what happens behind the scenes in warehouses and distribution centers around the world. Billions of dollars of goods are moved through these warehouses and fulfillment centers every day, and warehouse automation has seen significant growth. The integration of digitization, automation and robotics in these environments is revolutionizing the way we manage inventory and fulfill orders. E-commerce has more than doubled since 2019 to over $1.2 trillion to-date. This would not have been possible without higher and higher levels of automation being deployed in these fulfillment centers globally. Jabil is working both directly and indirectly with many of the world's largest brands on autonomous mobile robots, automated sorting systems and automated guided vehicles. At Jabil, we're constantly looking for ways to help solve some of the macroeconomic issues facing industry today. For example, the availability and cost of labor, to name but one. Jabil builds over 1,000 warehouse robots a month and powers another 4,000 a month with sub-assemblies that we also make. As we look to the future, we have several exciting projects that look to solve these labor issues with even more creative humanoid robotic solutions. As I have already discussed, digitization, automation and robotics can play a role in a wide range of settings, all of which are designed to increase safety, improve day-to-day operational efficiency, and deliver a superior customer experience. From automated picking and packing to real-time inventory management, these technologies are driving significant improvements in productivity, cost, accuracy and compliance. At Jabil, we're committed to helping our customers stay ahead of this curve by providing innovative solutions that address their unique challenges. For example, we have used our expertise in 3D printing to create solutions that allow our customers to solve technical issues and provide superior products to the markets they serve. We're constantly looking for ways to continue to help our customers become more efficient and meet the needs of their own customers. Our goal is to enable a more connected, efficient and customer-centric approach to commerce and logistics. We look forward to continuing to drive innovation and deliver value to our customers in these exciting and rapidly evolving fields. Now, I'd like to pass it off to Mike Dastoor for closing. Yeah. Thanks, David. If you look at that connected living piece, we're seeing some muted demand through the consumer. We're taking a pretty conservative view of their demand picture, which I think is feeding into our overall numbers there. And then, as we contrast that with digital commerce, which is much more of a level profile, we're in a really good shape for the second half."

            "name": "Steve Borges",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. I am excited to share some details on our Regulated Industries segment. Each of the end markets in this segment plays a critical role in addressing some of the most pressing challenges and opportunities in the world. Let's first start with healthcare. Many of the macro trends we've been discussing for the last several calls remain unchanged. Connected care is creating new markets by enabling remote monitoring and telehealth solutions. Personalized medicine continues to drive improved patient outcomes, particularly in the management of chronic diseases. By tailoring treatments to individual patients, healthcare providers can achieve better results and enhance the quality of life for millions of people. In addition, the introduction of weight loss drugs or GLP-1s drugs are all becoming increasingly important in today's healthcare landscape. New care settings are also emerging, creating opportunities for innovation. As healthcare delivery evolves, we see a shift towards more decentralized and patient-centric models. This opens new avenues for developing advanced medical devices and technologies that can be used in a variety of settings from hospitals to the home. As a result, we continue with a strong pipeline of design engagements to enable connected devices and home healthcare products for our customers. Meanwhile, the tailwinds of growth in autoinjectors, medical devices and diagnostics continues, most especially with the advent of many new biologics and individualized testing platforms. Another significant trend is the need to simplify the supply chain. The complexities of the healthcare supply chain have been highlighted in recent years, most especially during the rise of COVID. There is a growing demand for streamlined and efficient solutions. This need for simplification is leading to expanded outsourcing as healthcare device companies seek partners who can provide comprehensive supply chain management, engineering, design and manufacturing expertise, coupled with the quality requirements our customers demand. We are the largest manufacturing solutions provider for the healthcare industry with great diversification, covering diagnostics, medical devices, orthopedics and pharmaceutical delivery systems. Staying the largest will require us to expand our capabilities and accelerate growth by entering areas of the market with macro tailwinds, which will provide an enormous amount of Jabil TAM expansion while focusing on specific geographies, like Croatia and the Dominican Republic, to fuel that growth. The expanded capabilities and geographies will enable us to further simplify the supply chains for our customers. Internally, the most powerful aspect of what we produce is that, every single day, millions of patients around the world are using a product manufactured by Jabil. Now, turning to our automotive and transportation end market. Our expertise in product industrialization and manufacturing continues to enable innovation in powertrain electrification, autonomous driving and connected vehicle technologies. As the automotive and transportation industries undergo a transformative shift towards the mass adoption of electric vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems to meet global regulations and safety requirements, as well as the associated shift to centralized architectures, Jabil is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of transportation. We have seen some short-term volatility in demand due to regional changes in EV tariffs and incentives, which has been experienced across the entire automotive industry. The Jabil team has managed this well, supporting our customers as they manage their business through this unprecedented market evolution. Jabil remains partnered with global market-leading automotive OEMs across the most important technology platforms of the foreseeable future, advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving systems, connectivity, electrification and software-defined vehicles. Three of these platforms are agnostic to vehicle type, providing us with an opportunity to support our customers, however they choose. Each year, we continue to add new automotive OEM customers and technology leaders, providing further diversification across our customer portfolio. This positions Jabil extremely well as the automotive industry works towards meeting future governmental vehicle emission targets. Outside of our automotive customers, we remain engaged with strategic OEMs and suppliers focused on advancing precision agriculture. We leverage experience gained from serving automotive customers, as well as capability expertise from across Jabil, such as optics and fluidics, to help our customers bring the most innovative new farming technologies to the market. As the automotive and transportation market recovers, Jabil is well-positioned to capitalize on growth with expanded strategic capabilities, including our new facility in Croatia, which will support the growth of our European automotive business. We are focused on technology collaborations and investments and capabilities that best serve our long-term OEM customers and expand Jabil's role within the value chain. We are committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions that enhance vehicle performance, sustainability, safety and connectivity. Jabil is recognized in the market for our ability to industrialize complex technology designs, develop robust supply chains, and create automotive-grade automation strategies for the next-generation technologies entering the market today. We deliver these highly complex products with speed and quality while meeting functional safety requirements. Now, transitioning to our renewables and energy infrastructure end market. Global electricity demand is expected to grow at approximately 60% through 2040, and renewable energy is at the center of achieving global climate goals. At Jabil, we are leveraging our expertise in manufacturing and supply chain management to support the adoption of renewable energy technologies. In addition, with our U.S. footprint and the Inflation Reduction Act, we are well-positioned to help our customers transition products globally into the U.S., which may allow our customers to take advantage of tax incentives. Our work spans a wide range of applications, from inverters and optimizers to wind turbines, energy storage systems and smart grid technologies. Our success in energy storage manufacturing has positioned us to now extend into the automated assembly of critical elements of grid level storage systems, such as battery modules. This capability is expected to be leveraged by customers engaged in residential storage as the attach rate of these systems rise due to policy changes. Complementing the growth in renewable energy, we continue to add new customers that focus on energy management and building controls. Overall, the design, manufacturing and supply chain needs of renewable energy companies are becoming more complex, which increases their need to work with companies like Jabil. Customers appreciate the fact that we are committed to delivering high quality, reliable solutions that meet the growing demand for clean energy. Our modular and scalable designs allow for flexible deployment, optimizing resource use and reducing costs. I will now pass it along to Matt. Hi, Ruplu, this is Steve. Let me take that question. The overall healthcare market is growing about 3% to 4%. And we've been challenged this year. I think Mike mentioned this on prior earnings call, with the GLP-1 drugs, they've impacted our medical device segment really due to the reduction of the gastric bypass surgeries. But when I look at the business going forward, and I'll link to your question on GLP-1s as well, but now our healthcare business continues to be incredibly well-positioned. The growth of GLP-1 drugs and some of the new wins that we've been able to obtain, really associated with the injectors that we manufacture. And then, you take a look at just the challenge across the world as it relates to diabetes care, we had some nice new wins with CGMs, minimally invasive device growth, and the need for autoinjectors, generally speaking, because biologics are becoming dominant and with the complexities of the diseases. And so, we've won some exciting new programs. I think in Mike's opening remarks he mentioned fiscal year '26-'27. So, this is in our pharmaceutical business and our med device segment. And we like to say these programs are incredibly sticky. They last for many, many years of steady production, and we have great visibility with our customers. And what's also exciting is these are launching in some of our new factories, both in the Dominican Republic and Croatia. As a reminder, and again, Mike mentioned this, but the complexity of healthcare is really tied to the validation requirements, and then, you have the complexity of lead time for automation. So, new wins typically launch in cycles that are two to three years before you kind of reach that steady state production, but love where we're positioned in our healthcare business. The second part of your question, let me take that, which is the J&J question. There's -- certainly we remain positive. We've seen a strong pipeline that we're positioned on currently and it's at all different levels of discussions. And that's a really solid sign that our healthcare OEMs, they still view divestitures as a potential strategy for moving outsourcing faster. So, we'll see how those transpire over the year, but pipeline is really strong. Thanks, Steve. This is Steve. We kind of hit this at a kind of a broad level and then we can -- if you need to dial in further, let me know. But I think, as I said in the opening remarks, it is going through kind of a transition phase or transformation phase in the auto market. And it has been hampered by higher interest rates, the government incentives, in many cases, have been reduced, and then you have, like, as you mentioned, the overall tariff situation. So, it's been pretty dynamic. And we've seen some pushouts of programs that we had thought about for this fiscal year. But when you take a look at the general consumer challenges as well with the charging infrastructure concerns and battery range, you kind of sit back and you say, geez, there's some challenges ahead. And what I'll say though is despite the challenges, I actually remain pretty excited about the EV market because the growth -- you look at different forms of predictions, but still expected to be in the 25% to 30% range through 2030, albeit that's down from 48%, but that's still really strong growth. And I'd say between the growth rates and our ability to grow new relationships, we -- during this softness, we've added some new OEM relationships. We have a strong pipeline of opportunities. And I'd also say the team has done a really nice job during the softness where they've added other products that are agnostic to vehicle type. And that really shows the strength of our OEM relationships to try to use some of that capacity that we had in place to support their programs. And then, I'll just close with, in addition, we actually launched on time an OEM relationship in Croatia. And so, we're excited about that business as well. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Melissa. So, certainly genomic testing is -- continues to increase where we can kind of get granular on the disease and how to treat it, and so we are seeing growth in our diagnostic space linked to that, which is really exciting. On the general GLP-1 side, as I mentioned before, we continue to see very strong growth in that area of the business. As it relates to the other equipment areas like med devices, I would say that we continue to see a growth rate of that 3% to 4% range currently as we grow in the diabetes area of the business. Robotic surgeries, obviously, is an area that we strategically invested in over the past several years. We've added new customers, and we continue to do more and more of the surgical equipment itself, which is exciting, gives us great diversification and capability expansion as well that can be used elsewhere. So, yeah, we really like where we're positioned there as well. Sure. This is Steve. I'll take the question. Yeah, renewables is slightly up as we've been able to get some new wins in the HVAC space and battery storage. And then, with the IRA and its impact, we've been able to -- in our U.S. footprint, obviously, being well-positioned, has given us some opportunities there as well to ramp some new programs. So that's where it's coming from. We are not -- as Mike said, not looking for a solar residential or commercial rebound in the fiscal year, keeping that flat, but the growth is really coming from some new wins."

            "name": "Greg Hebard",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join our call today. I'd like to begin this morning by walking through our fourth quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $7 billion in revenue, $364 million above the midpoint of the guidance range. This was driven by stronger-than-expected results in our connected devices, networking and storage markets. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $401 million, or 5.8% of revenue, a solid improvement of 20 basis points compared to last year. Net interest expense was better than expected, coming in at $65 million, which was due to lower inventory levels and strong working capital management. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $318 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.18. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.30, which is $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now, let's look at the numbers by segment for the quarter. Our DMS segment posted revenue of $3.5 billion, which exceeded expectations by $79 million. This was primarily due to stronger growth in our connected devices business, although it was slightly offset by lower-than-expected revenue in the automotive business. Year-over-year, DMS revenue was down approximately 22%. This decrease was mostly due to the Mobility divestiture. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.4%, slightly lower than expected, reflective of the mix. In the EMS segment, we saw revenue of $3.5 billion, which was $285 million higher than anticipated. This was driven by stronger demand in our advanced networking markets as we closed out the year. While EMS revenue was down roughly 13% year-over-year, mainly due to the ongoing softness in the end markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print, we did see solid year-on-year growth across our cloud, semi-cap, and warehouse automation markets. This dynamic drove core margins for EMS to 6.1% in Q4, up an impressive 90 basis points year-over-year. Moving now to our end market performance for the year. Compared to our thoughts in June, connected devices, networking and storage came in better than anticipated, while auto and transport came in slightly lower. All other end markets largely came in as expected. Shifting gears to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, we continue to see robust results. Inventory at the end of Q4 was down five days sequentially, bringing it to 76 days. After adjusting for inventory deposits, net inventory days were 54, which is a four-day improvement quarter-over-quarter. Thanks to disciplined working capital management by the team, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $535 million. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $116 million and, for the full fiscal year, came in at $661 million, or 2.3% of revenue. As a result of the strong fourth quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in north of $1 billion. We exited the fiscal year with a healthy balance sheet with debt-to-core-EBITDA levels of approximately 1.3 times and cash balances of approximately $2.2 billion. With that, let's now turn to our capital structure on the next slide. We ended FY '24 with capacity under our global credit facilities of $4 billion. With this available capacity in our year-end cash balances, we had access to more than $6.2 billion of available liquidity. Our debt and liquidity profile are both solid and we believe current maturities are appropriately staggered and at attractive interest rates. We also remain fully committed to maintaining our investment grade credit profile. Moving now to our capital returns to shareholders on the next slide. We have repurchased 5.3 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased to 19.4 million shares, or $2.5 billion, which completed our FY '24 share repurchase authorization. This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY '13 to approximately 128 million shares at an average price of approximately $47, bringing our total return to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $6.7 billion. Importantly, included in our earnings release this morning, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, which we expect to fully execute in FY '25. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through a disciplined and balanced capital allocation approach. Moving to the next slide. The team performed well in FY '24, operating within a highly dynamic environment. In summary, over the past year, we sold off our Mobility business and used the net gains to buy back $2.5 billion of our shares, all while managing temporary challenges in major end markets like renewables, electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure and semi-cap. However, looking at the broader perspective, the company continues to be highly resilient and is well-positioned for future revenue growth, margin enhancement, and delivering robust free cash flow. With that, let's turn to our next slide for our first quarter guidance, beginning with revenue by segment. As Adam highlighted earlier, we're pleased to unveil this new business unit organizational reporting segment structure today. We will transition our reporting segments in FY '25 from DMS and EMS to three new reporting segments, Regulated Industries, Intelligent Infrastructure and Connected Living & Digital Commerce. This change is aligned with our new management structure and with how we drive our long-term planning and forecasting. For Q1, we anticipate revenue for our Regulated Industries segment will be $2.9 billion, down 9% year-on-year, reflective of softness in the renewable energy and EV markets. For our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect revenue for the quarter to be $2.3 billion, down 4% year-on-year. This is mainly due to us exiting certain legacy networking businesses at the end of Q4 FY '24. In our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.4 billion. The year-over-year decline is primarily driven by our Mobility divestiture. Speaking of Mobility, I'd like to highlight the seasonality of our business in FY '25 will reflect the impact of the divestiture. As a reminder, our Mobility business typically generated a significant portion of its income during Q1. This means going forward, our quarterly income and earnings progression will more closely resemble our historical EMS business, where typically 40% of earnings come in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. So, you can expect a more back-half weighted year as we go forward. Moving now to the enterprise guidance. Total company revenue for Q1 is expected to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Core operating income for Q1 is estimated to be in the range of $304 million to $364 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $143 million to $223 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.26 to $0.83. Net interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately $65 million and, for FY '25, we expect it will be $245 million. And our core tax rate for Q1 and for the year is expected to be 21%, reflecting impacts of Pillar Two global minimum tax legislation and jurisdictional earnings mix. We continue to believe it's prudent to anticipate higher tax rates beyond FY '25 in the range of 23% to 24% due to additional expected impacts from global minimum tax legislation. Moving to the next slide for our FY '25 guidance. For the coming year, we expect approximately $27 billion in revenue, with core margins in the range of 5.4%, while core earnings per share is expected to be $8.65. Please keep in mind, in FY '24, we divested our Mobility business partway through the fiscal year, while we also made the strategic decision to reshape our portfolio away from products in the legacy networking space. When adjusting for these changes, which accounted for $2.4 billion in revenue in FY '24, we believe our organic growth in FY '25 will be 2.3% on a base of $26.4 billion. We are forecasting another robust year for free cash flow generation in FY '25, around $1.2 billion. Additionally, due to the Mobility divestiture, we anticipate lower capital expenditures in the coming year. For FY '25, we expect CapEx to be between 1.5% to 2% of revenue. Most notably, as in past years, we plan to return 80% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and our newly announced $1 billion buyback authorization. With that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in Jabil. [Commercials] Yeah. Hi, Steve, this is Greg. Yeah, we're very confident on the $1.2 billion guidance on free cash flow. As Mike spoke on in his remarks regarding free cash flow conversion of being 80% to 100% of core net income, we feel '25 is going to be stronger. A couple of things related to that. We are targeting to take another couple days of working capital out of the cash cycle. And CapEx, we're seeing CapEx being approximately $200 million down year-over-year as we're looking at 1.5% to 2% of CapEx of revenue this coming year. So, really do feel confident on that $1.2 billion. Thanks, Steve. 9.3% for the year."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and thank you for joining Jabil's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Financial Officer, Greg Hebard, and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Dastoor. Over the next few minutes, we will review the following. Review our Q3 results, provide an update on current demand, and preview our seventh annual virtual investor briefing. Before we begin, please note that today's call is being webcast live. And during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted for audio playback. I'd now ask that you view the slides on the website and follow along with our presentation, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31st, 2023 and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Greg.\nGreg Hebard: Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. It's a great privilege to be a part of the call today. I'd like to begin this morning by walking through our third quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, $265 million above the midpoint of the guidance range on better-than-expected growth in our connected devices and networking and storage end markets. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $350 million or 5.2% of revenue, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. Net interest expense for Q3 came in better than expected at $64 million. This was due to lower levels of inventory during the quarter, reflecting improved working capital management by the team. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $261 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.89, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now turning to our performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, $65 million above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth within our connected devices business, offset slightly by the lower-than-anticipated revenue in our automotive and healthcare businesses. On a year-over-year basis, our DMS segment revenue was down approximately 23%, driven primarily by the mobility divestiture. Core operating margins for the segment came in at 4.6%, 50 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year-ago, reflective of the ongoing mix shift within our DMS business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, approximately $200 million above our expectations, driven by higher-than-anticipated revenue in our networking and storage end markets in the quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EMS revenue was down roughly 18%, driven mainly by lower revenue in end markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print, offset slightly by good growth in cloud. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment came in at 5.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Inventory at the end of Q3 came in six days lower sequentially at 81 days. Net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 58, which was a quarter-on-quarter improvement of four days. As a result of the team's good working capital management in the quarter, our third quarter cash flows from operations came in quite strong at $515 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $100 million, resulting in $450 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. In Q3, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for approximately $500 million, leaving us with approximately $700 million remaining on our current $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization as of May 31st. We remain fully committed to completing the share repurchase authorization by the end of FY '24. We exited Q3 with a healthy and solid balance sheet with debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2 times and cash balances of approximately $2.5 billion. And as a management team, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our fourth quarter guidance. For Q4, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Core operating income for Q4 is estimated to be in the range of $365 million to $425 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $285 million to $355 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.43. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.88. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $67 million. And our core tax rate for Q4 is expected to be 20%. Before moving to our full year guidance on the next slide, I'd like to provide a brief update on our net interest expense and core tax rate beyond FY '24. We now anticipate interest rates to remain elevated and expect our net interest expense to remain at FY '24 levels in FY '25 and be approximately $275 million. And for core tax rate in FY '25, we anticipate our core tax rate will be impacted by Pillar Two global minimum tax legislation. We will be required to adopt this only in FY '25. We are evaluating the impact this will have. As we sit today, we anticipate our core tax rate in FY '25 to be in the range of 22% to 24%. Now moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. For the year, we continue to expect $28.5 billion in revenue in the face of what continues to be a very dynamic demand environment. Compared with our thoughts in March, our expectations for growth in our automotive and transportation business has softened further. In particular, the market in China has been impacted due to overcapacity, resulting in a surplus of cars affecting local demand there and new global EV platforms that we originally expected to begin launching in the next 100 days or so have now shifted out several quarters. On the healthcare side, we see softness in medical devices, which we expect will create a headwind to revenue in the near term. These declines were offset by strength in connected devices and our AI data center end markets, which today are reported across industrial, cloud and networking end markets. All other end markets are largely in line with previous expectations. Given this updated end-market outlook, let's move to the next slide to review our FY '24 guidance. We continue to expect core margins for the year to come in at 5.6%, a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. We also expect to deliver EPS of $8.40 for the year. And importantly, we remain committed to generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow this year. With that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before I jump to my prepared remarks, a couple of comments. I am truly humbled by the trust placed in me by Mark and the Jabil Board. For the past 24 years, Jabil has been my professional home and witnessing the company's journey from $3 billion in 2000 to $28 billion is a true testament to the care we offer our customers. As CEO, I'm excited and carry a tremendous amount of gratitude to steward an amazing team. As Greg highlighted, the team has executed well in FY '24 amid a dynamic environment. Considering this, we divested our mobility business, a key strategic decision, we're capturing growth in the AI data center space and we're working towards our commitment to repurchase $2.5 billion of our shares, all while dealing with end-market softness in renewables, EVs and semi-cap equipment, which we expect to be short-term in nature. Yet when you take a step-back and put it all together, the company remains resilient and on track and we expect to deliver on key metrics, including 5.6% core margins and strong free cash flow in excess of $1 billion on $28.5 billion of revenue. More importantly, we remain well-positioned to benefit from many of the world's powerful trends in areas like AI data center infrastructure, healthcare, pharma solutions and automated warehousing to name a few. At the end of the day, the world needs complex manufacturing to enable innovation in nearly everything we do in our everyday lives. Jabil is at the forefront of providing solutions around a rapidly evolving technology landscape, with complex supply chains in an ever-changing geopolitical environment. As a management team, it's incumbent upon us to ensure we're focused on the right end markets, with the most innovative customers thereby delivering incredible solutions. And I think it's safe to say we're right in the middle of that ecosystem today. Moving ahead, we'll continue to reshape our diversified portfolio and remain focused on growing new and existing value-added businesses, driving margins and generating free cash flow. Let me share where I've been spending my time over the last six to eight weeks. I've been focused on our customers, our investors, our suppliers and our people. Some of the key takeaways are as follows. From a structure standpoint, I've chosen an organizational approach that has served us well over the last decade with an intense focus on speed, precision and solutions. This focused approach, I believe, targets our ability to serve each distinct market effectively by creating domain expertise in our core areas and better positions Jabil for growth. From a capital allocation standpoint, we will remain committed to returning value to our shareholders by prioritizing organic investments in our business and aggressively pursuing share buybacks at attractive valuation levels. This balanced approach ensures that we can reward our shareholders while simultaneously investing in next-generation capabilities. All the while, we will take care of our customers and suppliers while treating our people here at Jabil with respect. Turning to the business side of things. As you recall, on May 20th, we choose to rescind our FY '25 guidance. And it's worth noting there was no singular issue that led to that tough decision, but rather three key factors. For starters, many of the end markets we serve remains soft and the timing of recovery in these end markets remains unclear, particularly in EVs and semi-cap equipment. We also expect to accelerate reshaping our portfolio away from end markets and geographies with less attractive risk and financial outcomes. As a result, our revenue in FY '25 may be negatively impacted by approximately $800 million. However, this will set us up to be a much stronger company in the years to come. And lastly, in FY '25, we now expect interest expense and the tax rate to be higher due to a push-out of interest rate cut expectations and the global minimum tax that Greg noted earlier. Over the next couple of months, the management team will be spending a lot of time reviewing our plans for FY '25 and beyond, and in September, I fully anticipate providing a full year outlook per usual with our normal color and commentary surrounding our strategy, the end markets we serve and our anticipated capital allocation methodology for the year. From an end-market standpoint, you will hear how we've aligned technology-driven capabilities in our intelligent infrastructure business to help not only hyperscalers, but also silicon providers accelerate their own technology. Our manufacturing model leverages our automation capabilities to navigate the rapid growth in AI demand, how we're prioritizing growth in certain end-markets like healthcare and energy infrastructure, how we're helping retailers automate solutions in both the retail environment as well as warehousing to robotics, we'll also offer color on the businesses we anticipate deemphasizing in the future and of course, we'll do our best to provide our expectations around our roadmap for the timing of recovery in key areas like renewables, semi-cap, electric vehicles, connected devices and 5G. And when you put this all together, we'll describe how the seasonality has changed and how the capital intensity of our business has improved and the subsequent free cash flows we will generate, given our new mix of business. I am confident that the roadmap we develop will propel Jabil towards an even brighter future. I can assure you that all of these actions will remain squarely focused on driving margins higher in the long-run and generating robust, sustainable cash flow, all while taking care of our customers, suppliers and people. Jabil's success is not the result of individual efforts, but rather a collective achievement of our entire team. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the long-term trajectory of the company. We have a strong track record of talented and dedicated leadership team and a clear vision for the future. Together, we will continue to drive innovation, deliver value to our shareholders and execute for our customers. Before handing the call over to Adam, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire Jabil team for your commitment and dedication to our customers, communities and to each other. Thank you for your time and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now hand the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike, Greg, and congratulations to each of you on well-deserved new roles. I look forward to working alongside both of you. Before we move into our Q&A session, I'd like to take a few minutes to broadly summarize some of our key messages you heard today. First off, our fiscal '24 outlook is on track with the update we provided in March and subsequently reiterated in May. Notably, this includes $8.40 in core EPS, 5.6% core margins and $1 billion-plus in free cash flow. And as we move through Q4, we fully anticipate completing the balance of our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. As we turn our attention to the end markets, we remain fully committed to our year-over-year growth plans in our AI data center end markets in both fiscal '24 and '25, which today are reported across our cloud, networking and industrial end markets. At the same time, we're actively evaluating our portfolio to see if there's any opportunity to further optimize, as Mike just described. And for early modeling purposes, please keep in mind that our seasonality in fiscal '25 will be reflective of the mobility divestiture. As such, our quarterly earnings progression will be more like that of our EMS business, where we typically earn 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half of the year. Interest expense in fiscal '25, although rate dependent, is shaping up to be approximately $275 million. And our core tax rate is expected to increase from fiscal '24 to fiscal '25 as a result of Pillar Two global minimum tax legislation. And finally, and just generally speaking, Jabil remains extremely well-positioned to benefit from a recovery in many of the end markets that have proven to be headwinds in fiscal '24. And while the timing remains uncertain, the ultimate recovery will lead to solid revenue growth, further margin expansion and even more cash flow generation on an already installed capacity. We look forward to updating you on these matters and more on our seventh annual investor briefing, which is tentatively scheduled for September 26. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya. Please go ahead.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike and Greg, congrats on your new assignments. Mike, what do you see as the biggest opportunity for Jabil over the next year and what do you see as the biggest risk? And Greg, a similar question to you as CFO, what are your main focus areas for the next year?\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Ruplu. I think you're aware I\u2019ve been the CFO for six years and during this time, my focus areas have always been and always will continue to be margins and free cash flow and utilization of that free cash flow for buyback purposes. We still do think we're undervalued. So that's a key area of capital allocation that will continue well with the focus on margins, continuous focus on free cash flow. We're in all the right sort of end markets as well. So from an opportunity standpoint, are there end markets that we're not in? Yes, we'll be looking into that. That's one of the reasons we're structured the way we are in the new organization. But right now, yes, there's some softness in some of our end markets. But over the long term, these end markets are ripe for recovery. And I'm not suggesting that happens in the next one or two quarters. I think we have seen some of that shifting -- the recovery shifting to the right. So overall, from an opportunity perspective, I think the key is when does this whole AI proliferation in almost everything we do. So we're a hardware company. AI is going to require hardware refreshes across the board and we're playing in almost all the right end markets. So I do expect that entire AI proliferation to be a tailwind for us. So that happens in the next one or two quarters, perhaps not right now, it's more data center focused. But over the long-run, I do expect that to proliferate across the entire range of end markets we serve. From a risk standpoint, Ruplu, I think it's the timing of the recovery. I think there's various anecdotes outside externally, internally. Some would suggest things are recovering a little bit slower than we anticipated. Some suggest that it might be okay. So we'll take this time over the next three or four months to figure out our plan. That was one of the reasons we rescinded our FY '25 guidance and we'll provide much more color on our analyst briefing in -- at the end of September.\nGreg Hebard: Yeah. Hi, Ruplu, it's Greg. Just to reiterate some of the things Mike just said. Definitely expanding operating margins, it will be a key focus, continuing to generate strong free cash flows, as you saw quite a strong Q3 we had, and then return capital to shareholders. We continue to be super thoughtful on this and believe share repurchase is still a great use of our cash for Jabil.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Got it. Mike, you talked about AI. I mean when I look at things, AI is getting to be a very competitive space. And so how do you see Jabil's investments in AI trending over the next few years? And do you think margins on the AI side trend lower or higher than the rest of the business, given the increased competition?\nMike Dastoor: So, I think you're absolutely right. There is a large amount of competition, Ruplu. Today, if you think about where we play in AI, it's mainly around server rack equipment. As we look at data center building infrastructure, we're looking at power, we're looking at cooling. We're looking at value-add services around some of these data center pieces as well. So there will be a -- margin sort of will slow down, but it will start picking up again over time as we start expanding around an AI data center driven strategy. So, we're looking at other pieces in the periphery, along the lines of silicon photonics, we're looking at OSAT packaging. So there's a whole bunch of things that we look at from an AI perspective. And I think margin does -- it's not going to go jump-up quite a bit right now, but it will go down and come back up pretty fast.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Maybe I'll try and sneak one more in. You talked about some weakening of the auto and the healthcare space. And also on semi-cap, I think you've said that it's weaker than expected. When do you expect a recovery in these? And if revenues continue to be weak, what are some of the levers you have to continue to drive margins and free cash flow? I think you've said margins are a focus. So what are some of the levers you have on the margin and free cash flow side, given if revenues are weak? Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike Dastoor: Right. So, Ruplu, let me try and answer your auto question first. I think in auto, we are seeing some weakness, particularly as it relates to China. I think there's an oversupply situation there. That does impact manufacturing for us local to local and local for Asia -- sorry, local for export purposes as well. So we're seeing some push-out in the whole EV recovery space because of the situation in China. From a semi-cap standpoint, we -- I think our initial expectation was a full-scale recovery in December or January -- in December '24 or January '25. That's pushing out a little bit to the right. And I think you'll see a little bit of a weird situation there where China is a dominant player right now. There is sell-through into China, but a lot of that sell-through is coming from existing inventory. So we expect a Jabil impact to start around the middle of calendar year '25. From a margin standpoint, Ruplu, we do expect all of these end markets to start coming back at some point or the other. So it's not a -- we're not in a full-blown recession where we go and completely close down facilities and take down costs because we lose out when the recovery does come through. So you might see some level of temporary margin impact there. But overall, trajectory and our position when the recovery starts will be extremely strong. And I'll give you an example. I think our -- today, we're probably capacitized for about $30 billion to $33 billion of revenue. And if you look at in FY '25, obviously, it will be considerably lower than that. So we'll have a little bit of surplus capacity. We do want to take that out. I don't think the answer is take capacity out. I think we're going to wait for that recovery to come back and there might be some level of temporary margin impact, but long-term, really well-positioned.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. Congrats again on the new assignments.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning and congrats, Mike and Greg on your appointments. I guess I had two questions. First of all, just following-up on those last comments, Mike, I mean the guidance for Q4 implies you hit that magical 6% operating margin number. So I'm just curious if you could put that number into context. You just described a lot of seasonality and some mixed markets. So, like, how sustainable is 6% as more of a Q4 number versus like something that's ongoing as you think out to next year? And then I had a follow-up.\nMike Dastoor: Yeah. So, thanks, Steve. First of all, I do think there is an amount of seasonality that we see in almost every single Q4. So you'll see margins go up because of that for sure. And I think Adam highlighted even FY '25, when we think about that, we expect the second half -- going forward, second halves to be much more than the first half of the year because of our mobility divestiture. There is some level still of fixed cost recoveries. And when you have fixed cost recoveries, but no revenue flowing through, there is definitely a bit of a margin impact. I do think -- I don't think 6% is what we're going to be seeing. It's not sustainable in Q1. If you look at historical seasonality, Q1, things go down. Q2 is consistent with Q1 and then we see another sort of Q3 and Q4 uptick in margins. So 6%, I would say, has a little bit of one-offs in it and is not sustainable for the first half of the year, but Q3, Q4 of next year, you'll see similar sort of seasonality from a margin perspective.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. And then in terms of your prepared remarks, I guess there's one area I was hoping you could dig into a little bit. You mentioned with your second point, some reshaping geographically end-market is on the table now for next year. Can you just sort of expand on what you saw in your last six to eight weeks that makes you want to sort of, I guess, change strategy just incrementally a little bit? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: Sure. So, Steve, I've always been focused on margins and free cash flow. I think you've seen that over the last six years. We continue to prioritize margins and cash flow. If we see some level of accounts where the one or two of these metrics don't shape up too well, we're looking at it from a reshaping our portfolio, sort of away from some of those end markets and geographies as well with less sort of attractive risk and financial outcomes. So it spread out a little bit. I would look at legacy networking as one of the areas where you see this, the legacy networking going down, you will see the AI piece replacing some of that. So you'll see an increase in AI, but you will see a little bit of a decrease on the legacy networking piece as well. Again, this positions us really well. So I'm not saying margins will jump up in '25 because of this. But over the long-term in FY '26 and beyond, the margin structure will improve along with better cash flows. I think Greg talked about free cash flows coming in really strong in Q3. We continue to be focused on free cash flows going forward because that's where we think the valuation lies is in the free cash flow.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from George Wang of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Wang: Guys, congrats on the new role. So I have two parts. Firstly, you mentioned the 3Q driven by connected devices and the networking storage, you also raised the full year forecast subsequently for the two segments. Just can you talk about kind of what's driving better kind of results and outlook for the connected devices and networking? Just, is this a kind of industry growth or kind of share gains?\nMike Dastoor: I think it's probably neither of those. It was a little bit of conservative forecasting from our perspective. If you see connected devices over the last maybe a couple of years, post-COVID, it's been a little bit down and we've always sort of tried to make sure that our forecasts are accurate. In this particular instance, the numbers came in, I don't think we're seeing a big jump-up in the end-market, but I think the whole impact in Q3 was mainly because of the conservative forecasting that we sort of anticipate.\nGeorge Wang: Got you. Just a quick follow-up, if I can. I just want to confirm, is it still $6 billion AI revenue for FY '25? You guys talked about in the prepared remarks, you didn't really change the forecast. So I just want to confirm, it's still $6 billion. But also like I just want to hone in on the power and cooling, you guys talked about some of the value-add. Obviously, power cooling has been massive shortage with higher margins. So can you talk about your differentiation and some of the initiatives on the table from Jabil's standpoint to capture the kind of inherent sort of shortage and the kind of the demand associated with power and cooling in the data center?\nMike Dastoor: Let me hit the power and cooling question first. One of the things we are seeing in the data center space, the legacy data centers are going through a retrofit. And at retrofit, we were looking at capabilities there where we can offer services to data centers from a cooling distribution unit perspective. If you look at new deployments, the legacy ones are more liquid to air. The newer deployments are liquid to liquid cooling. Well, we have internal capabilities around that. And we'll be continuing to look at small capability-driven transactions in that space as well. The key here is to expand our service around server rack integration and into the whole data center building infrastructure as well. And we -- I think that will be a big differentiator around.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, thank you.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on your commentary on networking, the strength, but also the customer base. You indicated that you may -- to walk away from some of the legacy business, I'm guessing you're talking about the traditional OEM market. But I know that you've got a growing data center and hyperscale customer base, particularly on the server side. But are you also working with those customers on network products like switches? And could you tell us exactly what you're doing for those partners on the networking side?\nMike Dastoor: Yeah. So I think that's a great question. I think you're absolutely right. It's the legacy piece from the networking side that we're sort of walking away from, a lot of that is being replaced anyways by future forward-looking AI, liquid cool sort of switches. We're definitely getting involved in that. We're looking at -- if you look at our silicon photonics piece, we're looking at the whole transceiver business, which gets attached to that space quite a bit as well. So overall, networking and storage, think of it as a transition where we're transitioning from a legacy network to a new era of networking and switching and we're going to be playing heavily on the new networking and switching. At the same time, the legacy business will go down a bit.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. And then on the networking side, we're seeing some of your peers have an ODM model where they're actually doing custom work for customers and others are building to customers design. Are you going through both routes or mostly on the more traditional EMS side?\nMike Dastoor: I think it will be a hybrid -- we're not going full ODM. At this stage, we're definitely going to continue in the EMS space. Historically, we've stayed away from competing directly with our customers and we'll continue to do that, Matt.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, great. Thank you. And just turning to the balance sheet and your forecast for that higher interest -- net interest expense next year or basically flattish. Could you just talk through the capital allocation? I know you've done aggressive buybacks, significant. But why not take-down some of the short-term borrowings or some of your debt to reduce that? And also, if you look at your inventory, inventory days, they've come down a lot, but they're still well above where they were post-pandemic. So is there work to be done in terms of inventory or the working capital to bring that net interest expense down?\nGreg Hebard: Yeah. Hi, this is Greg. So yeah, I think there's a few parts to that question. I'd say first on interest expense and share buyback, we definitely look at the two combined and making sure we have the most effective EPS results from that. Interest expense, we do see rates continuing to stay elevated for most of the calendar '24 and into '25, so being conservative on that number. From a working capital perspective, I think we've been doing a really good job. We do see our debt inventory in the 55 to 60-day range. And do we -- and we do see some cyclicality of that during the year and intra-quarter. So obviously, this quarter, we had a good number that hit. But one thing to remind you as well, we do have inventory deposits that does offset some of that pickup and we do just look at our gross [DII] (ph) coming down. So, we're continuing to be very focused on net inventory and getting it down closer to 55, but there is some cyclicality on that. On the share repurchase, we are committed to completing our $2.5 billion share authorization in Q4. We do need a new Board authorization as we go into '25. So stay tuned for that. But looking to get our WASO into the 110 to 113 range by the end of FY '25.\nMike Dastoor: And, Matt, if I can just add, provide some more color on the interest. If you go back to FY '23, so not this year, but previous years, our interest was in the range of $150 million. I think if you look over time, it was in that range. I'm not suggesting we go back to $150 million. Today, it's at $275 million. But as interest rates start coming down and we have a full year impact of that more towards the end of our calendar year '25, you'll see interest start going down quite a bit as well, because $275 million is not going to be the norm. It's going to continue to go downwards. It won't go back to $150 million, but a two -- low-200s is highly possible and all of that just drops directly to the EPS line.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And just if I can just sneak in a last question regarding the $800 million headwind you talked about for next year, most of that coming from end demand weakness. But is there a part of that also coming from deselecting customers, as you said, as you [put in] (ph) the portfolio? Could you break that down for us?\nMike Dastoor: All of that comes from deselecting, not deselecting, but renegotiating with customers. It's coming down. I think the number I provided was $800 million. That is a part of our strategy. Like I've mentioned before, margins and free cash flow continue to be front and center of everything we do. And we're just -- it's reshaping our portfolio sort of away from end markets and geographies with less attractive risk and financial outcomes. So it's all that. And then I think I mentioned legacy networking being one of the big ones there. So it's all -- it's all driven by literally reshaping the numbers. I think if you look at all the other end markets, they are more than soft, I'd say the recovery -- the timing of that recovery has been pushed out, is continuing to be pushed out a little bit. So the other end markets will be down, but there's no reshaping going on around that and that $800 million that I referenced was probably a reshaping number. There will be some level of revenue impact as the timing of recovery gets shifted to the right as well.\nMatt Sheerin: That's very helpful to clarify. And I would imagine that $800 million revenue is -- at that margin and return profile is below your company average. So that would be accretive in other words to the business?\nMike Dastoor: Absolutely. I'm not -- again, I'm not suggesting FY '25 will see a big accretion because of that. I talked about us being capacitized for $32 billion, $33 billion of revenue. Our revenues are going to be considerably short of that. So we will have a little bit of overcapacity, but we need that capacity when things start to recover. And I think it will be very short-sighted of us to go and address that incremental capacity that we have today. So yes, there will be margin accretion in these businesses overall from a company standpoint, just keep in mind that there is a little bit of an overcapacity situation right now as well. But think of that as an opportunity. When things start coming back, it will have a big margin impact. And does that happen towards the end of '25? Does that happen in FY '26? We just don't know right now. And that's why we've asked for a little bit more time and that's why we withdrew our FY '25 guidance. We will provide more color in -- at the end of September to the best of our abilities.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. First, a follow-up on the $800 million of revenue that the company is looking to deselect. Can you help us better understand what the margin profile is of that? I know you said it's below the corporate average, but is it just above breakeven, low single-digits, slightly below corporate average? Any more color on the EBIT margin associated with that $800 million would be helpful.\nMike Dastoor: It's south of enterprise margin. It's not just the margin. We look at the free cash flow profile as well that both of those metrics are critical for our success. I think the -- one of the things we're looking at is risk as well. So obviously, the financial metrics have to tie out, the risk has to tie out as well, risk in different parts of the world, risk in the end markets that are seeing a downward trend all being replaced by a new perspective. So it's all of that work and the margin will be south as I was mentioning on the previous question from Matt. Don't expect margins to jump-up in '25 because of this. There is a little bit of an overcapacity situation. So the margin does get impacted and it's over time. I do expect maybe towards the end of FY '25 or even in FY '26 to see a pickup in margin because of this. So it's a mid to long-term payback or a return.\nMark Delaney: Helpful color. Thanks for that, Mike. And then my second question was around hybrids. You mentioned in the presentation that you have some ability to grow with hybrids, not just with BEVs. Can you double-click a little bit more, talk to us around where Jabil is participating in hybrids and to what extent you have the design wins that would support growth in hybrids as some of the traditional OEMs are planning to grow faster in hybrids over the next few years? Thanks.\nMike Dastoor: So, I think when I talked about EVs, I think the point I was trying to break -- make was that we're almost agnostic to whether it's EVs that succeed or hybrids that succeed. And I think if you look at some of the three or four areas that we participate in, I think it's software-defined vehicles, that applies across combustion, hybrids and EVs. If you look at the battery management systems and everything to do with the battery, it equally applies to EVs and hybrids. If you look at some of the connectivity piece, again, it applies to all three categories of automotive. And then if you look at automated driving with optics, with cameras, with a whole bunch of ADAS technologies, again, agnostic to which technology wins out. We still think EVs is ripe for a comeback. I think it's seeing some temporary sort of impact due to price, due to battery range. Just couple of those issues being resolved and EVs will be back again. But the point I was trying to make is, look, we're going to have an EV or a hybrid. When EVs go down and hybrids go up, there'll always be a little bit of a timing difference as we win programs in the hybrid space for them to come online. But the long-term trajectory for our EV business is actually quite agnostic in terms of which technology wins out.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is [MP] (ph) on for Samik Chatterjee. So I just wanted to ask, like, you had included outlook around connected devices, networking storage, 5G, cloud, et cetera. So a lot of AI revenue is recognized in these end markets early. So I just wanted to check how much of the increase in the outlook is because of AI versus traditional recovery in the end markets? And I have a follow-up.\nMike Dastoor: So in the other end markets, I think Greg talked about the three that are impacting us today from an AI perspective. All the other end markets, something it's a little too early for us to start sort of assuming AI pieces in there. I think AI is definitely coming. AI is definitely going to impact all of those end markets. Hardware refresh cycles will take place in a number of our end markets, but our assumptions wouldn't bake that in right now. As we see it coming forward, we will start putting some of that in. But the answer -- direct answer to your question is, there's very little, there's almost no AI in any of the other end markets at this stage.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And another one will be on operating expenses. So I believe since the revenues were quite higher than the midpoint of the guidance this quarter, but operating expenses, which is something which I believe drove the operating margins to be below the midpoint of guidance. So what exactly was driving the higher operating expenses? And what's your confidence on bringing this to track for strong 6% margin next quarter? Thank you.\nGreg Hebard: Yeah, Samik, it's really a mix that we're seeing recently. So we -- again, some seasonality to that, but all that is related to mix.\nOperator: Samik, do you have additional questions?\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. There's no questions.\nGreg Hebard: Thanks, Samik.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Vogt of UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Andrew on for David. I wanted to ask a question about your wireless business. As we've moved past the elections in India, have you seen any signs that, that business might pick back up?\nMike Dastoor: At this stage, not really. I think there's been a mass scale deployment of 5G already in India. I think there's definitely -- I think there's a hope that they monetize that and move forward after they've seen some returns. So they're almost -- I think there's 75%, 80% sort of rolled out. I don't think we have some big assumptions of a post-election recovery in India at this stage.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And I just also wanted to follow-up on the comments about the softness you saw in the healthcare segment. I think you said it was in the medical devices part of that business. I'm just wondering if you could expand on what was driving that softness? Is it macro? What are you seeing there?\nMike Dastoor: So, when we say softness, just note that it's just one of the four or five things that we do in the entire healthcare space. I think if you look at the GLP-1 drugs, they're off the charts. They just keep going higher and higher and higher. There's no -- and we're really well-positioned to play in that space. There is a counter sort of impact, obviously, that impacts surgeries, medical devices. But there's a whole bunch of other things that we do as well from a diagnostic standpoint, from an orthopedic standpoint, from a pharma solutions standpoint, from other medical devices. So it's a smaller impact. I wouldn't -- Greg called it out, I think it was an issue specifically for our FY '24. We're seeing some short-term headwinds there because of that. But don't forget the GLP-1 piece will continue to grow. I think the only sort of constraint is capacity, putting that capacity in place, which takes a little bit of time due to the heavy automation that's involved on the GLP-1 piece.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nAdam Berry: That's it for this call. Thank you very much. If you have any further questions, please reach out. We will be happy to talk. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Greg Hebard",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. It's a great privilege to be a part of the call today. I'd like to begin this morning by walking through our third quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, $265 million above the midpoint of the guidance range on better-than-expected growth in our connected devices and networking and storage end markets. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $350 million or 5.2% of revenue, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. Net interest expense for Q3 came in better than expected at $64 million. This was due to lower levels of inventory during the quarter, reflecting improved working capital management by the team. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $261 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.89, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Now turning to our performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, $65 million above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth within our connected devices business, offset slightly by the lower-than-anticipated revenue in our automotive and healthcare businesses. On a year-over-year basis, our DMS segment revenue was down approximately 23%, driven primarily by the mobility divestiture. Core operating margins for the segment came in at 4.6%, 50 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year-ago, reflective of the ongoing mix shift within our DMS business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, approximately $200 million above our expectations, driven by higher-than-anticipated revenue in our networking and storage end markets in the quarter. Compared to the prior year quarter, EMS revenue was down roughly 18%, driven mainly by lower revenue in end markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print, offset slightly by good growth in cloud. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment came in at 5.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Inventory at the end of Q3 came in six days lower sequentially at 81 days. Net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 58, which was a quarter-on-quarter improvement of four days. As a result of the team's good working capital management in the quarter, our third quarter cash flows from operations came in quite strong at $515 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $100 million, resulting in $450 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. In Q3, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for approximately $500 million, leaving us with approximately $700 million remaining on our current $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization as of May 31st. We remain fully committed to completing the share repurchase authorization by the end of FY '24. We exited Q3 with a healthy and solid balance sheet with debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2 times and cash balances of approximately $2.5 billion. And as a management team, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our fourth quarter guidance. For Q4, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Core operating income for Q4 is estimated to be in the range of $365 million to $425 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $285 million to $355 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.43. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.88. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $67 million. And our core tax rate for Q4 is expected to be 20%. Before moving to our full year guidance on the next slide, I'd like to provide a brief update on our net interest expense and core tax rate beyond FY '24. We now anticipate interest rates to remain elevated and expect our net interest expense to remain at FY '24 levels in FY '25 and be approximately $275 million. And for core tax rate in FY '25, we anticipate our core tax rate will be impacted by Pillar Two global minimum tax legislation. We will be required to adopt this only in FY '25. We are evaluating the impact this will have. As we sit today, we anticipate our core tax rate in FY '25 to be in the range of 22% to 24%. Now moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. For the year, we continue to expect $28.5 billion in revenue in the face of what continues to be a very dynamic demand environment. Compared with our thoughts in March, our expectations for growth in our automotive and transportation business has softened further. In particular, the market in China has been impacted due to overcapacity, resulting in a surplus of cars affecting local demand there and new global EV platforms that we originally expected to begin launching in the next 100 days or so have now shifted out several quarters. On the healthcare side, we see softness in medical devices, which we expect will create a headwind to revenue in the near term. These declines were offset by strength in connected devices and our AI data center end markets, which today are reported across industrial, cloud and networking end markets. All other end markets are largely in line with previous expectations. Given this updated end-market outlook, let's move to the next slide to review our FY '24 guidance. We continue to expect core margins for the year to come in at 5.6%, a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. We also expect to deliver EPS of $8.40 for the year. And importantly, we remain committed to generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow this year. With that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Yeah. Hi, Ruplu, it's Greg. Just to reiterate some of the things Mike just said. Definitely expanding operating margins, it will be a key focus, continuing to generate strong free cash flows, as you saw quite a strong Q3 we had, and then return capital to shareholders. We continue to be super thoughtful on this and believe share repurchase is still a great use of our cash for Jabil. Yeah. Hi, this is Greg. So yeah, I think there's a few parts to that question. I'd say first on interest expense and share buyback, we definitely look at the two combined and making sure we have the most effective EPS results from that. Interest expense, we do see rates continuing to stay elevated for most of the calendar '24 and into '25, so being conservative on that number. From a working capital perspective, I think we've been doing a really good job. We do see our debt inventory in the 55 to 60-day range. And do we -- and we do see some cyclicality of that during the year and intra-quarter. So obviously, this quarter, we had a good number that hit. But one thing to remind you as well, we do have inventory deposits that does offset some of that pickup and we do just look at our gross [DII] (ph) coming down. So, we're continuing to be very focused on net inventory and getting it down closer to 55, but there is some cyclicality on that. On the share repurchase, we are committed to completing our $2.5 billion share authorization in Q4. We do need a new Board authorization as we go into '25. So stay tuned for that. But looking to get our WASO into the 110 to 113 range by the end of FY '25. Yeah, Samik, it's really a mix that we're seeing recently. So we -- again, some seasonality to that, but all that is related to mix. Thanks, Samik."

            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before I jump to my prepared remarks, a couple of comments. I am truly humbled by the trust placed in me by Mark and the Jabil Board. For the past 24 years, Jabil has been my professional home and witnessing the company's journey from $3 billion in 2000 to $28 billion is a true testament to the care we offer our customers. As CEO, I'm excited and carry a tremendous amount of gratitude to steward an amazing team. As Greg highlighted, the team has executed well in FY '24 amid a dynamic environment. Considering this, we divested our mobility business, a key strategic decision, we're capturing growth in the AI data center space and we're working towards our commitment to repurchase $2.5 billion of our shares, all while dealing with end-market softness in renewables, EVs and semi-cap equipment, which we expect to be short-term in nature. Yet when you take a step-back and put it all together, the company remains resilient and on track and we expect to deliver on key metrics, including 5.6% core margins and strong free cash flow in excess of $1 billion on $28.5 billion of revenue. More importantly, we remain well-positioned to benefit from many of the world's powerful trends in areas like AI data center infrastructure, healthcare, pharma solutions and automated warehousing to name a few. At the end of the day, the world needs complex manufacturing to enable innovation in nearly everything we do in our everyday lives. Jabil is at the forefront of providing solutions around a rapidly evolving technology landscape, with complex supply chains in an ever-changing geopolitical environment. As a management team, it's incumbent upon us to ensure we're focused on the right end markets, with the most innovative customers thereby delivering incredible solutions. And I think it's safe to say we're right in the middle of that ecosystem today. Moving ahead, we'll continue to reshape our diversified portfolio and remain focused on growing new and existing value-added businesses, driving margins and generating free cash flow. Let me share where I've been spending my time over the last six to eight weeks. I've been focused on our customers, our investors, our suppliers and our people. Some of the key takeaways are as follows. From a structure standpoint, I've chosen an organizational approach that has served us well over the last decade with an intense focus on speed, precision and solutions. This focused approach, I believe, targets our ability to serve each distinct market effectively by creating domain expertise in our core areas and better positions Jabil for growth. From a capital allocation standpoint, we will remain committed to returning value to our shareholders by prioritizing organic investments in our business and aggressively pursuing share buybacks at attractive valuation levels. This balanced approach ensures that we can reward our shareholders while simultaneously investing in next-generation capabilities. All the while, we will take care of our customers and suppliers while treating our people here at Jabil with respect. Turning to the business side of things. As you recall, on May 20th, we choose to rescind our FY '25 guidance. And it's worth noting there was no singular issue that led to that tough decision, but rather three key factors. For starters, many of the end markets we serve remains soft and the timing of recovery in these end markets remains unclear, particularly in EVs and semi-cap equipment. We also expect to accelerate reshaping our portfolio away from end markets and geographies with less attractive risk and financial outcomes. As a result, our revenue in FY '25 may be negatively impacted by approximately $800 million. However, this will set us up to be a much stronger company in the years to come. And lastly, in FY '25, we now expect interest expense and the tax rate to be higher due to a push-out of interest rate cut expectations and the global minimum tax that Greg noted earlier. Over the next couple of months, the management team will be spending a lot of time reviewing our plans for FY '25 and beyond, and in September, I fully anticipate providing a full year outlook per usual with our normal color and commentary surrounding our strategy, the end markets we serve and our anticipated capital allocation methodology for the year. From an end-market standpoint, you will hear how we've aligned technology-driven capabilities in our intelligent infrastructure business to help not only hyperscalers, but also silicon providers accelerate their own technology. Our manufacturing model leverages our automation capabilities to navigate the rapid growth in AI demand, how we're prioritizing growth in certain end-markets like healthcare and energy infrastructure, how we're helping retailers automate solutions in both the retail environment as well as warehousing to robotics, we'll also offer color on the businesses we anticipate deemphasizing in the future and of course, we'll do our best to provide our expectations around our roadmap for the timing of recovery in key areas like renewables, semi-cap, electric vehicles, connected devices and 5G. And when you put this all together, we'll describe how the seasonality has changed and how the capital intensity of our business has improved and the subsequent free cash flows we will generate, given our new mix of business. I am confident that the roadmap we develop will propel Jabil towards an even brighter future. I can assure you that all of these actions will remain squarely focused on driving margins higher in the long-run and generating robust, sustainable cash flow, all while taking care of our customers, suppliers and people. Jabil's success is not the result of individual efforts, but rather a collective achievement of our entire team. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the long-term trajectory of the company. We have a strong track record of talented and dedicated leadership team and a clear vision for the future. Together, we will continue to drive innovation, deliver value to our shareholders and execute for our customers. Before handing the call over to Adam, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire Jabil team for your commitment and dedication to our customers, communities and to each other. Thank you for your time and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now hand the call over to Adam. Thanks, Ruplu. I think you're aware I've been the CFO for six years and during this time, my focus areas have always been and always will continue to be margins and free cash flow and utilization of that free cash flow for buyback purposes. We still do think we're undervalued. So that's a key area of capital allocation that will continue well with the focus on margins, continuous focus on free cash flow. We're in all the right sort of end markets as well. So from an opportunity standpoint, are there end markets that we're not in? Yes, we'll be looking into that. That's one of the reasons we're structured the way we are in the new organization. But right now, yes, there's some softness in some of our end markets. But over the long term, these end markets are ripe for recovery. And I'm not suggesting that happens in the next one or two quarters. I think we have seen some of that shifting -- the recovery shifting to the right. So overall, from an opportunity perspective, I think the key is when does this whole AI proliferation in almost everything we do. So we're a hardware company. AI is going to require hardware refreshes across the board and we're playing in almost all the right end markets. So I do expect that entire AI proliferation to be a tailwind for us. So that happens in the next one or two quarters, perhaps not right now, it's more data center focused. But over the long-run, I do expect that to proliferate across the entire range of end markets we serve. From a risk standpoint, Ruplu, I think it's the timing of the recovery. I think there's various anecdotes outside externally, internally. Some would suggest things are recovering a little bit slower than we anticipated. Some suggest that it might be okay. So we'll take this time over the next three or four months to figure out our plan. That was one of the reasons we rescinded our FY '25 guidance and we'll provide much more color on our analyst briefing in -- at the end of September. So, I think you're absolutely right. There is a large amount of competition, Ruplu. Today, if you think about where we play in AI, it's mainly around server rack equipment. As we look at data center building infrastructure, we're looking at power, we're looking at cooling. We're looking at value-add services around some of these data center pieces as well. So there will be a -- margin sort of will slow down, but it will start picking up again over time as we start expanding around an AI data center driven strategy. So, we're looking at other pieces in the periphery, along the lines of silicon photonics, we're looking at OSAT packaging. So there's a whole bunch of things that we look at from an AI perspective. And I think margin does -- it's not going to go jump-up quite a bit right now, but it will go down and come back up pretty fast. Right. So, Ruplu, let me try and answer your auto question first. I think in auto, we are seeing some weakness, particularly as it relates to China. I think there's an oversupply situation there. That does impact manufacturing for us local to local and local for Asia -- sorry, local for export purposes as well. So we're seeing some push-out in the whole EV recovery space because of the situation in China. From a semi-cap standpoint, we -- I think our initial expectation was a full-scale recovery in December or January -- in December '24 or January '25. That's pushing out a little bit to the right. And I think you'll see a little bit of a weird situation there where China is a dominant player right now. There is sell-through into China, but a lot of that sell-through is coming from existing inventory. So we expect a Jabil impact to start around the middle of calendar year '25. From a margin standpoint, Ruplu, we do expect all of these end markets to start coming back at some point or the other. So it's not a -- we're not in a full-blown recession where we go and completely close down facilities and take down costs because we lose out when the recovery does come through. So you might see some level of temporary margin impact there. But overall, trajectory and our position when the recovery starts will be extremely strong. And I'll give you an example. I think our -- today, we're probably capacitized for about $30 billion to $33 billion of revenue. And if you look at in FY '25, obviously, it will be considerably lower than that. So we'll have a little bit of surplus capacity. We do want to take that out. I don't think the answer is take capacity out. I think we're going to wait for that recovery to come back and there might be some level of temporary margin impact, but long-term, really well-positioned. Thanks, Ruplu. Yeah. So, thanks, Steve. First of all, I do think there is an amount of seasonality that we see in almost every single Q4. So you'll see margins go up because of that for sure. And I think Adam highlighted even FY '25, when we think about that, we expect the second half -- going forward, second halves to be much more than the first half of the year because of our mobility divestiture. There is some level still of fixed cost recoveries. And when you have fixed cost recoveries, but no revenue flowing through, there is definitely a bit of a margin impact. I do think -- I don't think 6% is what we're going to be seeing. It's not sustainable in Q1. If you look at historical seasonality, Q1, things go down. Q2 is consistent with Q1 and then we see another sort of Q3 and Q4 uptick in margins. So 6%, I would say, has a little bit of one-offs in it and is not sustainable for the first half of the year, but Q3, Q4 of next year, you'll see similar sort of seasonality from a margin perspective. Sure. So, Steve, I've always been focused on margins and free cash flow. I think you've seen that over the last six years. We continue to prioritize margins and cash flow. If we see some level of accounts where the one or two of these metrics don't shape up too well, we're looking at it from a reshaping our portfolio, sort of away from some of those end markets and geographies as well with less sort of attractive risk and financial outcomes. So it spread out a little bit. I would look at legacy networking as one of the areas where you see this, the legacy networking going down, you will see the AI piece replacing some of that. So you'll see an increase in AI, but you will see a little bit of a decrease on the legacy networking piece as well. Again, this positions us really well. So I'm not saying margins will jump up in '25 because of this. But over the long-term in FY '26 and beyond, the margin structure will improve along with better cash flows. I think Greg talked about free cash flows coming in really strong in Q3. We continue to be focused on free cash flows going forward because that's where we think the valuation lies is in the free cash flow. I think it's probably neither of those. It was a little bit of conservative forecasting from our perspective. If you see connected devices over the last maybe a couple of years, post-COVID, it's been a little bit down and we've always sort of tried to make sure that our forecasts are accurate. In this particular instance, the numbers came in, I don't think we're seeing a big jump-up in the end-market, but I think the whole impact in Q3 was mainly because of the conservative forecasting that we sort of anticipate. Let me hit the power and cooling question first. One of the things we are seeing in the data center space, the legacy data centers are going through a retrofit. And at retrofit, we were looking at capabilities there where we can offer services to data centers from a cooling distribution unit perspective. If you look at new deployments, the legacy ones are more liquid to air. The newer deployments are liquid to liquid cooling. Well, we have internal capabilities around that. And we'll be continuing to look at small capability-driven transactions in that space as well. The key here is to expand our service around server rack integration and into the whole data center building infrastructure as well. And we -- I think that will be a big differentiator around. Thanks, George. Yeah. So I think that's a great question. I think you're absolutely right. It's the legacy piece from the networking side that we're sort of walking away from, a lot of that is being replaced anyways by future forward-looking AI, liquid cool sort of switches. We're definitely getting involved in that. We're looking at -- if you look at our silicon photonics piece, we're looking at the whole transceiver business, which gets attached to that space quite a bit as well. So overall, networking and storage, think of it as a transition where we're transitioning from a legacy network to a new era of networking and switching and we're going to be playing heavily on the new networking and switching. At the same time, the legacy business will go down a bit. I think it will be a hybrid -- we're not going full ODM. At this stage, we're definitely going to continue in the EMS space. Historically, we've stayed away from competing directly with our customers and we'll continue to do that, Matt. And, Matt, if I can just add, provide some more color on the interest. If you go back to FY '23, so not this year, but previous years, our interest was in the range of $150 million. I think if you look over time, it was in that range. I'm not suggesting we go back to $150 million. Today, it's at $275 million. But as interest rates start coming down and we have a full year impact of that more towards the end of our calendar year '25, you'll see interest start going down quite a bit as well, because $275 million is not going to be the norm. It's going to continue to go downwards. It won't go back to $150 million, but a two -- low-200s is highly possible and all of that just drops directly to the EPS line. All of that comes from deselecting, not deselecting, but renegotiating with customers. It's coming down. I think the number I provided was $800 million. That is a part of our strategy. Like I've mentioned before, margins and free cash flow continue to be front and center of everything we do. And we're just -- it's reshaping our portfolio sort of away from end markets and geographies with less attractive risk and financial outcomes. So it's all that. And then I think I mentioned legacy networking being one of the big ones there. So it's all -- it's all driven by literally reshaping the numbers. I think if you look at all the other end markets, they are more than soft, I'd say the recovery -- the timing of that recovery has been pushed out, is continuing to be pushed out a little bit. So the other end markets will be down, but there's no reshaping going on around that and that $800 million that I referenced was probably a reshaping number. There will be some level of revenue impact as the timing of recovery gets shifted to the right as well. Absolutely. I'm not -- again, I'm not suggesting FY '25 will see a big accretion because of that. I talked about us being capacitized for $32 billion, $33 billion of revenue. Our revenues are going to be considerably short of that. So we will have a little bit of overcapacity, but we need that capacity when things start to recover. And I think it will be very short-sighted of us to go and address that incremental capacity that we have today. So yes, there will be margin accretion in these businesses overall from a company standpoint, just keep in mind that there is a little bit of an overcapacity situation right now as well. But think of that as an opportunity. When things start coming back, it will have a big margin impact. And does that happen towards the end of '25? Does that happen in FY '26? We just don't know right now. And that's why we've asked for a little bit more time and that's why we withdrew our FY '25 guidance. We will provide more color in -- at the end of September to the best of our abilities. It's south of enterprise margin. It's not just the margin. We look at the free cash flow profile as well that both of those metrics are critical for our success. I think the -- one of the things we're looking at is risk as well. So obviously, the financial metrics have to tie out, the risk has to tie out as well, risk in different parts of the world, risk in the end markets that are seeing a downward trend all being replaced by a new perspective. So it's all of that work and the margin will be south as I was mentioning on the previous question from Matt. Don't expect margins to jump-up in '25 because of this. There is a little bit of an overcapacity situation. So the margin does get impacted and it's over time. I do expect maybe towards the end of FY '25 or even in FY '26 to see a pickup in margin because of this. So it's a mid to long-term payback or a return. So, I think when I talked about EVs, I think the point I was trying to break -- make was that we're almost agnostic to whether it's EVs that succeed or hybrids that succeed. And I think if you look at some of the three or four areas that we participate in, I think it's software-defined vehicles, that applies across combustion, hybrids and EVs. If you look at the battery management systems and everything to do with the battery, it equally applies to EVs and hybrids. If you look at some of the connectivity piece, again, it applies to all three categories of automotive. And then if you look at automated driving with optics, with cameras, with a whole bunch of ADAS technologies, again, agnostic to which technology wins out. We still think EVs is ripe for a comeback. I think it's seeing some temporary sort of impact due to price, due to battery range. Just couple of those issues being resolved and EVs will be back again. But the point I was trying to make is, look, we're going to have an EV or a hybrid. When EVs go down and hybrids go up, there'll always be a little bit of a timing difference as we win programs in the hybrid space for them to come online. But the long-term trajectory for our EV business is actually quite agnostic in terms of which technology wins out. So in the other end markets, I think Greg talked about the three that are impacting us today from an AI perspective. All the other end markets, something it's a little too early for us to start sort of assuming AI pieces in there. I think AI is definitely coming. AI is definitely going to impact all of those end markets. Hardware refresh cycles will take place in a number of our end markets, but our assumptions wouldn't bake that in right now. As we see it coming forward, we will start putting some of that in. But the answer -- direct answer to your question is, there's very little, there's almost no AI in any of the other end markets at this stage. At this stage, not really. I think there's been a mass scale deployment of 5G already in India. I think there's definitely -- I think there's a hope that they monetize that and move forward after they've seen some returns. So they're almost -- I think there's 75%, 80% sort of rolled out. I don't think we have some big assumptions of a post-election recovery in India at this stage. So, when we say softness, just note that it's just one of the four or five things that we do in the entire healthcare space. I think if you look at the GLP-1 drugs, they're off the charts. They just keep going higher and higher and higher. There's no -- and we're really well-positioned to play in that space. There is a counter sort of impact, obviously, that impacts surgeries, medical devices. But there's a whole bunch of other things that we do as well from a diagnostic standpoint, from an orthopedic standpoint, from a pharma solutions standpoint, from other medical devices. So it's a smaller impact. I wouldn't -- Greg called it out, I think it was an issue specifically for our FY '24. We're seeing some short-term headwinds there because of that. But don't forget the GLP-1 piece will continue to grow. I think the only sort of constraint is capacity, putting that capacity in place, which takes a little bit of time due to the heavy automation that's involved on the GLP-1 piece."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and thank you for joining Jabil's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor; and Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson. Over the next few minutes, Mike and I will review our Q2 results, update current demand trends and provide new guidance for fiscal '24. We will then turn the call over to Kenny, who will provide several of the building blocks that give us confidence in our strong outlook for fiscal '25. Before we begin, please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of the call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted for audio playback. I'd now ask that you view the slides on the website and follow along with our presentation, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and our other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our second quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue roughly in line with the guidance range we provided as a majority of the businesses performed extremely well against the updated guidance we provided back in December. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $338 million, or 5% of revenue. This was up 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year due to a strong mix of business led by automotive and health care, while also supported by an ongoing mix shift within our networking and storage end markets. Net interest expense for the quarter came in higher than expected at $72 million, reflecting higher levels of inventory during the quarter. It's also worth noting that we successfully closed on the sale of our mobility business to BYD Electronics during the quarter for approximately $2.2 billion. As a result, GAAP operating income was approximately $1.1 billion, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $7.31, reflecting the substantial gain associated with the sale at the end of December. Core diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.68, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range provided in December. Now turning to our performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, down approximately 16% from the prior year, driven almost entirely by year-over-year comparisons for the mobility divestiture. On a like-for-like basis, our DMS segment performed very well, led by approximately 11% growth in our automotive and transportation businesses. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.6%, 100 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, reflective of the ongoing mix shift within our DMS business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.3 billion, down roughly 18% year-over-year and roughly $100 million to $200 million below our expectations for the quarter. The majority of our year-on-year revenue decline within EMS was driven by our move to a consignment model within our cloud business and lower revenue in markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print as expected. However, unexpectedly, and towards the end of the quarter, our 5G and renewables businesses were both negatively impacted by yet another decline in demand associated with those end markets. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment were 4.4%, down 70 basis points year-over-year. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q2, beginning with inventory, which came in nine days higher sequentially to 87 days. Net of inventory deposits for our customers, inventory days were 62%, which was quarter-on-quarter increase of four days. Our second quarter cash flows from operations came in at $218 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $170 million, resulting in $48 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $825 million, leaving us with approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of February 29. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $2.6 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2 times. In closing, Q2 was largely a solid quarter. For starters, the divestiture of our mobility business and the allocation of those funds towards the share buybacks reflect the strategic intent of this management team to both reshape the business where appropriate, while also maintaining healthy returns to shareholders. At the same time, the business is performing pretty admirably despite considerable declines in two of the end markets we serve, as evidenced by our ability to deliver higher margins despite these headwinds. And finally, I'll leave you with a bit of optimism as we look ahead to fiscal '25 and beyond. As we think about the adjacencies across the end markets we serve, it's becoming clear that there's a common theme forming among a number of the end markets, specific to the surge of artificial intelligence, and the impact it will have on our customers' business well into the future. And with this surge, there's a proliferation of data being created by EV and autonomous vehicles that needs to be harnessed. In the health care industry, we're in the early innings of getting our arms around the benefits of AI in the operating room. And in our cloud business, we're seeing significantly increased demand for our services related to AI specific to hardware, manufacturing and design. And perhaps most exciting, this enthusiasm is beginning to turn into tangible results. For instance, our AI GPU volume in the first half of 2024 is 200 times that of the level of 2023. So there's a lot to be excited about as we look a little bit further down the road. In a few minutes, Kenny will share his thoughts on fiscal '25 and why he believes our original outlook of 10.65 remains attainable despite a transitional fiscal '24. But first, I'll hand the call over to Mike, who will provide more details on fiscal '24, including an update on our growth outlook by end market. With that, thank you. I'll now hand the call over to Mike.\nMichael Dastoor: Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following: First, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for Q3 and updated outlook for FY '24. Next, I'll provide an update on why we are confident in our growth opportunities for FY '25. And then, I'll provide an update on our accelerated share buyback execution plans, which are progressing ahead of schedule. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our third quarter guidance. Towards the end of our second quarter, we experienced a sudden slowdown within our 5G and renewable energy end markets, which we expect will continue through the second half of FY '24 and result in lower than expected revenue for the last two quarters. Within our renewable energy business, the inventory correction that began in our Q1 is now expected to persist through the balance of our fiscal year as customers in this end market lower demand forecast towards the back half of February. The renewable energy team has done an excellent job consolidating the supply chain within our current customer base and we will have a higher overall share of our customers' business as we move towards the end of Q4. In 5G, towards the end of the quarter, infrastructure rollout slowed quicker than expected as faster growing markets like, India substantially pull back on all 5G infrastructure investments. As a result of these two market dynamics for Q3, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion. Core operating income for Q3 is estimated to be in the range of $325 million to $385 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $221 million to $301 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $1.38. Net interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be $75 million. Now moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. At a high level, with the exception of the near-term dynamics within our renewable energy and 5G markets, the majority of our expectations for revenue by end market this year remains largely in line with our pots in December. Importantly, for the year, we continue to expect year-on-year growth across some of our core end markets, which are still experiencing year-on-year growth, notably in electric vehicles, health care and AI cloud data centers. Moving to the next slide. Despite the revenue headwinds in the near term, we are confident that we will Jabil to be more resilient as we've diversified across geographies, products, customers and end markets. Because of this, we're not anticipating the same level of margin erosion traditionally seen in past slowdowns. Our diversified approach, global footprint and strong relationships with customers give us confidence in weathering these near-term challenges. We're adapting, staying focused on margins and cash flow and committed to delivering value. Notably, by FY '24, we expect core operating margins to come in higher than we expected in December at 5.6%. Three reasons largely account for our ability to drive margins higher despite lower revenue. First, as our agile model allows, we pushed our planned investments and costs that will plan to support new ramps in renewables in the back half of the fiscal year, because of this, deleveraging is limited. Second, we expect to offset lower revenue with fixed cost recoveries from 5G and renewable energy customers. And third, we made progress with our efforts to align our cost structure and footprint with our go-forward business. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core operating margins of 5.6% in FY '24 and positions us well for future margin expansion as we drive revenue growth higher on an optimized cost structure. Putting it all together for FY '24 on the next slide. We expect our improved mix of business and optimization efforts will drive incremental operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core operating margin guidance to 5.6%, for FY '24 on revenue of $28.5 billion. We expect this dynamic to result in core EPS of $8.40, which is reflected by improved core operating income margin and accelerated share repurchases. Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating more than $1 billion in free cash flow. Moving to the next slide. Overall, we feel good about the trajectory of our end market portfolio and are well positioned to drive growth in FY '25 and headlined by continued growth in automotive, health care and AI data centers along with anticipated recoveries in areas of our business that are contracted this year. Globally, both EV and hybrid platforms continue to outpace ICE unit growth rates, albeit at a lower rate than we had originally anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Our EV business is supporting a number of new vehicle platforms with multiple customers in areas such as next-gen compute and control modules, power conversion battery management, LIDAR and other sensors as well as charging solutions. Additionally, we were recently awarded new business in optical camera modules where OEMs are redeploying optics hardware capabilities, enabling the rollout of different levels of autonomous driving through software updates. It is important to note the majority of the year-on-year growth we expect in EDs in FY '25 will be driven by new programs and will be less reliant on volume growth with existing customers. These new platforms gives us confidence in our expectations of another year of growth for EVs in FY '25. Longer term, Jabil is well positioned to support both EV and hybrid technologies as they continue to take a larger overall share of auto unit growth globally. Within our health care business, we see significant opportunity to offer critical solutions and capabilities to customers outsourcing complex tasks. Jabil's credibility in health care as the largest EMS provider in the space positions us well to take advantage of the growing outsourcing of manufacturing trend. In FY '25, we anticipate another year of growth in our base business as we continue to explore opportunities in new capabilities and B2B transactions similar to our strategic collaboration from a few years ago. And in the data center space, there is a common theme forming among a number of our end markets related to the surge of investments in AI and ML. The pace of AI investments continues to accelerate, and Jabil is winning our fair share of this growing pie as we have positioned ourselves well to assist our customers build out next-generation AI data centers. Our teams are quickly diversifying and winning share across multiple end markets in the AI data center infrastructure space, where we're seeing growth in AI GPU right configurations accelerated optical switches for AI back end networking applications, silicon photonics, liquid cooling capabilities and power and energy storage. Given our success to date in this space, we now expect AI related net revenue across multiple end markets to be approximately $6 billion in FY '25, or an increase of 20% year-on-year. Within the semi-cap market, we continue to anticipate demand to remain muted for FY '24. However, overall market dynamics are expected to improve as commentary across the industry suggests recovery may be on the horizon with a growing expectation that things improve towards the end of this calendar year, as fab utilization ticks higher and memory inventory normalizes. And in renewables, as we look to FY '25, while we expect this end market to recover very slowly, we are winning new business and market share along with the aforementioned consolidation within our current customer base. Longer-term, we remain well-positioned to support secular growth in the renewable energy infrastructure space due to Jabil's unique combination of power engineering expertise, in-region manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. Looking forward, we're excited about the underlying momentum across our diversified portfolio and are well-positioned to drive growth in FY '25. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchases. In December, I outlined our intentions of executing a series of accelerated buybacks for the balance of the $2.5 billion repurchase authorization in FY '24. I\u2019m happy to say that we're ahead of schedule with $825 million repurchased in Q2. This brings our year-to-date repurchase amount to 10.4 million shares for $1.3 billion for an average purchase price just under $127 per share. We fully anticipate completing the remaining $1.2 billion on our current repurchase authorization in FY '24 and we'll continue to opportunistically optimize our repurchases. With the plan in place and progress to date, I expect WASO to be in the range of $123 million to $126 million for FY '24 and approximately $110 million to $113 million in FY '25. On the next slide, in summary, for FY '25, I'm excited about the underlying momentum across our diversified portfolio, and I'm confident that we're well positioned to drive multiple paths of growth in FY '25 as a result of the following: consolidation of share in the renewable energy space, expected recovery of the semi-cap end market, confirmed market share gains with multiple existing customers, new programs booked with new customers, and I am particularly excited about our silicon to solution strategy, which will help accelerate the infrastructure that will be required to fuel the AI/ML macro trend in the market. This is borne out in the continuing mix shift of our networking and storage end market where we continue to replace legacy lower margin networking equipment with higher margin AI driven equipment. On top of all this, when you consider our optimized cost structure, we are well-positioned to expand core margins to more than 5.7%. In addition, our accelerated share repurchases and expected lower net interest expenses gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core EPS of $10.65 in FY '25. In my view, Jabil has not just more diversified, but also significantly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets, which offer higher returns and multiyear secular growth opportunities. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Kenny.\nKenny Wilson: Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Fiscal '24 was always going to be a transitional year for Jabil, one of which we've successfully completed the largest transaction in the company's history with the mobility sale and its subsequent efforts by our teams to optimize our footprint and cost structure for the go-forward company. For this transaction and the optimization of our footprint were anticipated, the end market slowdown was not. As I have stated previously, the key attribute of our model is agility and our ability to quickly react and effectively absorb changes in revenue. At Jabil, we obsess about operations, working tirelessly to ensure that what is within our control, we control well. Managing our factories to absorb such a March slowdown does not happen by chance, so it's pleasing to see our margins hold up. Additionally, dislocations like this provide opportunity for some consolidation and is reassuring to make progress with customers who trust us to allocate more of their spend to Jabil. In tandem with our focus on operational execution, we have been intentional in how we've shaped our commercial portfolio. The closing of the mobility deal was not a one-off event, but part of a process where we look telling our capabilities current and future with markets exhibiting the desirable characteristics of long term secular growth at appropriate margins and cash flows. The result of this allows us to help simplify the lives of our current and future customers while making appropriate returns. For example, in our recent history, this has seen us transition from low tech electronics and automotive to EV and autonomous driving systems, including optical cameras. From PCBA manufacturing and health care to precision machining of customized implantable, from build-to-print servers to highly configurable AI data center racks, from simple network switches to liquid cooled accelerated switching supporting AI applications and from build-to-print in the telco space, starting a seat at the table, as we look to optimize our advanced packaging value chain for silicon photonics across multiple end markets. In short, we are continuously retailing the company to ensure we are ready to support the future needs of our customers. In addition to the mobility deal, another couple of proof points were evident in the quarter. We are proud to have been awarded a new video security and optics business with Motorola Solutions, including two highly competent manufacturing sites in North America. This supports a focus on supply chain regionalization where we see significant benefits from the ability to leverage our global footprint coupled with the advantage of being domiciled in the U.S. And in the AI data center infrastructure space, we are building low and medium voltage switchgear to support proliferation of AI data centers. We were awarded a liquid cooled accelerated network switching program, which will ramp in fiscal year '25. While already, we are seeing the benefits of the addition of the Intel Silicon Photonics team with multiple wins in the pluggable transceiver space. As I think about exiting this year as a more optimized company, coupled with the numerous opportunities across our commercial portfolio, I'm confident in our ability to expand margins year-on-year while also delivering core EPS of $10.65 and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Note that in modeling fiscal year '25, we anticipate total revenues similar to fiscal year '23 levels, excluding the mobility divestiture. Importantly, we expect mix to be much improved as our business continues to trend toward markets, benefiting from long-term secular trends. In closing, in the last 90 days, I have had the privilege of spending time with multiple customers and internal organizations, including executive team at Motorola Solutions, as we celebrated the new award. In addition to the Jabil team from Retronix, Procurability and Intel and with our teams in Asia as we celebrated Chinese New Year with a long held Jabil [indiscernible] tradition. While in Asia, it was also my honor to accept a Shingo prize awarded to our health care site in Shanghai, the largest med device side to receive this award in the last 15 years. As I reflect on all of this, I believe it further demonstrates that in addition to having the right capabilities and being in the right end markets, we also have the right team to buy their actions every day, strengthen our unique global culture. All of this puts us on firm footing for fiscal '25 and beyond. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now hand the call back to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Kenny. So there was a lot here today. And in closing, I'd like to quickly summarize some of the key messages. Our second quarter results and our fiscal '24 outlook are largely in line with the guidance we provided back in December, with the exception of the impact from two specific end markets, including renewable energy and 5G wireless. And despite our lower outlook for '24, positive demand signals in the market, along with new wins, higher core margins due to mix shift and the accelerated buybacks from the proceeds of the mobility transaction give us confidence in fiscal '25 which is why we chose to maintain our $10.65 core EPS target. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your questions.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning. Two questions from me, if I could. I guess, first of all, on the cuts within 5G and renewables programs. Can you give us a sense for why you think this is the last time you're going to have to come back and cut those numbers? Like, what are the indications, not just through the fiscal year, but through maybe the calendar year from customers on that front? And then secondly, on the better margins that you're targeting now, I understand the mix shift, but maybe a little bit more color on like the biggest mix shift drivers if we exclude the mobility math from that? Thanks.\nKenny Wilson: Hi, Steven. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah. Let me take that, the question on demand. I mentioned in Q1 when we've seen the broad-based demand reduction that we've got a process where we do we're pretty intimate with our customers in terms of their forecast, looking at inventory and inventory in channels. We called that right across all of our end markets with the exception of the 5G telco space and renewables. And there's a couple of specifics there. So Mike mentioned the India issue here, and I think what we see here is that although, we said, there was a substantial pullback. In effect, what happened was the rollout stopped with -- basically with no input from the Reliance in this instance. So when we look at that, there's no indication of that and basically, we've baked into our number now going forward. So we're comfortable that everything else in the telco space, we've seen and we understood. This was just a gotcha in India. We're not forecasting or expecting that to recover in this year. So we think we're pretty safe there. In the renewable space, again, we've been working with the customer through calendar Q4 into Q1. And what we decided to do there is that basically, the inventories in the channel, and it's not going to be sold through. So we've reduced the build plan, they\u2019ve register what they're going to ship. And what we're seeing is that the inventory in channel now is now reducing. We haven't forecasted a covering that this year also. So we've been very, very conservative. Also, just as we look to '25, we've been very conservative, and we've modeled those run rates going forward into '25. So when you look at what we're talking about in '25, we don't expect these two end markets to recover. So we think we've been appropriately conservative.\nSteven Fox: Great. And then on the margin question?\nMichael Dastoor: Hey, Steve. Yeah. So obviously, the mix shift does have a huge impact. We've replaced a lot of our legacy networking and storage business with higher margin AI related business there, obviously, AI by itself in the cloud space, although, you don't see it in the revenue line item because of the consignment effect, the volumes are up considerably in that particular line item. So there's a big margin play coming through on the mix shift that you suggested. And on top of that, we've done a lot of cost optimization. If you go look back at our -- I think on the call maybe earlier in the fiscal year, we talked about a stranded cost and footprint optimization restructuring that we've taken then. The fruits of that are showing up in the second half of the year. Obviously, we had Q2 was a little bit of a transition quarter for the cost optimization effort. But that's coming through. And then if you look at some of the cost recoveries that we're getting from our customers, even though revenues are down, we are -- we have been successful in getting cost recoveries because of the sudden nature of the cut. So all of that plus Q3, Q4 had some ramps in there. Obviously, as the revenue is pushed out, we don't have to have those ramps. And then I'll just remind you, ramps are at a much lower margin in those initial quarters when we're moving up on that revenue line item. So that gets pushed out a little as well. So a combination of all that, Steve, gives us really good comfort. I think we said 5.3% to 5.5% margin. Previously, we've actually taken it up, not just to the high end. We've taken it beyond that, and we think it's going to be more in the 5.6% range, and we feel really good about that.\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. I have a follow-up to that also, Steve, and we've been talking about this and obviously, with yourself. But I think Slide 17 is a pretty good pictorial view of why we're confident that our margins in the longer term will be robust. Historically, we would be in the server space here when I think back three, four, five years ago. And then what we're trying to show here is just how as well as being vertical in terms of going to asset like rack assembly that's been hugely successful for us. But if you look at everything else interest we've gone from being a legacy enterprise switching to accelerated switching that supports AI with the awards that we won recently. Optical transceivers or pluggable transceivers in this instance that we got a lot of horsepower from the Intel deal that we just closed. And incidentally, I met with the Intel team in Singapore in January and the hit the ground running and are really making a huge difference, which is great for us. But there's things like the CDUs, liquid cooled racks, and also, we're now doing, as I mentioned, the low voltage bid voltage switchgear and the rack power distribution. So historically, that's markets that we wouldn't be planning in at all. But what we find is from being a server player to now we're getting multiple income streams in that space -- with things where a little bit of the data center being disaggregated. It just gives us confidence when I said that we're retail in the company, what I was talking about is we're leveraging things that we've done historically will listen to our customers, and we're finding other value-added activities so we can help them. We can reduce their costs and we can increase our margins. So I think that can underpin what we try to do from a margin perspective to satisfy our customers' needs grow our margins and make that sustainable in the longer term.\nSteven Fox: Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks for that answer.\nKenny Wilson: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I was trying to count how many times you mentioned AI in your prepared remarks, and then I just lost count. So needless to say, AI is a meaningful driver for demand in different end markets. Mike, is there a way to quantify how much revenue will come from AI over the next year or what the margin impact would be? And Kenny, can you delve a little bit more into what you're doing in the cloud business? What is Jabil's competitive advantage? A lot of people are going into AI in the data center. So how do you think your competitive advantage stands against others and how do you see your cloud business revenues growing over the next couple of years?\nMichael Dastoor: Hey, Ruplu. Just to be clear, I said AI 21 times in my reports, so I did count. On the AI piece, so if you look at my prepared remarks, Ruplu, I did talk about the AI revenue. I think we're going to grow by about 20%, 25%. We're about in the $4.5 billion, $5 billion range, we're going to be north of $6 billion in FY '25 and that's across multiple end markets. Obviously, as Kenny mentioned, we'll be playing in the cloud data infrastructure space. We play in areas such as network switching. There's a whole bunch of business that was switching from or replacing from our legacy network business to AI-related business. Sort of its spread out, particularly in those two line items when we call them out on our revenue chart. But overall, about $6 billion plus, we actually feel that will continue to grow in that 20%, 30% range over time as this proliferation of AI across different end markets just continues to expand. So it's starting off where you expect it to start in the cloud space. And then as you work around the cloud space, that will gain more momentum. And then as you go forward, and I'm talking here two years out, even that was spread into all our other end markets as well because all that we do is mainly hardware and all hardware will benefit from the AI proliferation.\nKenny Wilson: And let me take your second question, Ruplu, on Jabil's competitive advantage. Firstly, what I would say is, I think that the growth in this area means that there's going to be a lot of work for a lot of people. So I think that's good. When we look at our competitors, I think there's enough work to go around. That said, what we try to do is we try to look at the world through the eyes of our customers and make their life simpler. And then if you look at -- there's a need in the data centers to be able to do silicon photonics transceivers. These need to be able to do power and switching. There's a need to be able to do servers need to be able to do rack assembly. What we find our customers look to do is their life becomes -- the more suppliers they add, the more and more complicated the life becomes. So if they have a credible supplier that can do multiple different activities, then that's helpful for them. You take, for example, if you can do pluggable transceivers, but you don't do line cars and then you want to put the optical device on a line card. That becomes an issue as we can do both of that. So we think the view for us is to be able to be vertical and to be able to integrate more services that becomes a play for us. is something that we've seen across automotive, Mike mentioned the cameras that we're producing in automotive, for example. So we think that, that serves us well, the other thing that I think remains to be seen, but I think it's basically not a negative but a positive for sure. We have a global footprint, so we can leverage best practices and capabilities across the world, but being domiciled in North America, we see has been helpful in the longer term from a secure supply perspective. So we think we put all of that together, we feel that we're well positioned, and all we got to do is perform. So we're pretty bullish on the long-term opportunities and growth in this area.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up, I want to push you a little bit. I mean this is the second time in a row that you're cutting full year guidance. I mean last time revenues you cut by $2.5 billion. And this time, it looks like ex the $400 million for the mobility business, the takedown is about $2.1 billion. So my question is really the same as I had last time, which is, what gives you confidence in your guidance and how can investors get confidence that you won't come in even lower for fiscal '24, for example, if renewables is weak, why can't it get even weaker? And then Mike, just on the -- for next year, you talked about all these drivers for margin improvement. My question would be what can derail that? I mean what are some of the risks to Jabil attaining that margin and what should we look out for? Thank you so much for taking my questions.\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. So let me take a step back, Ruplu, because we've reflected on that a lot. The relationships we've got with our customers is -- and generally has been long term in some instances, has been multi-decades. So we have a partnership there. We're kind of joined at the hip connected. We've got processes where we share forecasts. We look at inventory. So we're pretty tight. We've got people in our sites, whether it's business development people, planners, et cetera, et cetera, that are involved in this. So this isn't the top down. It's -- we bubble this up from the bottom. So -- and I can understand the question. In Q1, we've seen a broad-based reduction. And if I look forward from what we when we looked at Q2, across the majority of our end markets, what we predicted is going to happen for the balance of the year is happening. So we're comfortable with that. And sometimes you get out higher, like India, for example, I mean, no one expected with the rate -- the deployment of radios in India that, that would just all of a sudden stop. So I think that, that in this instance, that becomes something that you got accept that sometimes things will happen. In the renewable space, we spend a lot of time with -- we've got more customers now than we had six months ago. And we spend a lot of time with them. It's clear that the slowdown and the rollout of the inventory we got in channel has been much lower than expected. We've taken our numbers way, way down. But in that also, we look -- it's mainly a residential play that's been soft. We are pivoting so that we are much more in the commercial side, and that's been supported by our customers. We're also -- we're winning market share, and there's been a lot of consolidation to Jabil in that space lightly. And if you read the it seems like the commercial space in the U.S. is becoming more robust and we'll be building that in North America also. So we're getting share. We're taking our numbers down significantly. The balance of our business, we think, is holding up. So we think we're really at the bottom here. But what I would like to add though a little bit to your question is -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got to be really, really good at control in what we can control. Whether this has been a pullback, slowdown, recession, inventory correction, whatever you want to call it, if we look back in our company's history, the last couple of times this has happened. Our EPS has gone down by 40% or margins by 100 basis points or more. Here, we're working really hard, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, to make the company much more resilient and robust. So I think that we demonstrate that in spite of shops in a couple of our end markets that that our businesses has taken a couple of punches, but staying remarkably resilient. So my message to investors would be that sometimes like outliers happen. But I think it was improving our margins and I think 840 EPS, I think it demonstrates that our company is much more robust than it was historically.\nMichael Dastoor: And Ruplu, I'm going to answer your question in a slightly different way than you were at it. Obviously, you asked about the risk and what can go wrong and why the margin story holds good for us. So let me just try and answer it by talking about the $10.65 a little bit. Because all of that is factored into our $10.65 guide. Why do I feel so strongly about that particular $10.65 number. Before that, let me just give you some building blocks. So if you look at what our interest costs this year will be in the high 200s. We expect next year to be in the mid-$200 million. So if you take an interest number of about $250 million for the building block there, if you take WASO (ph), we will have done substantially the $2.5 billion will be completed by FY '24. In FY '25, we'll continue a more normalized run rate of buyback. So I expect WASO to be about $110 million to $113 million in FY '25. Now based on these two numbers, if you take the incremental income that's needed to make $10.65, the numbers are around $130 million to $140 million of incremental income. I talked about some of the end markets, how we're sort of benefiting from some other macro trends that are coming into play right now. I talked about AI, I talked about the different end markets within storage, in cloud, et cetera, where we're seeing this whole AI proliferation. And that alone, as I mentioned, is about $1 billion to $1.5 billion incremental revenue, net revenue, I should add as well, sort of net of any consignment effect that FY '25 presents. We've talked about -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks, automotive, what we're seeing for FY '25 and our assumption is not based on end market growth. Our assumption is based on new program wins. We're talking about wins that we already have under the belt. We've already booked those and it's just a matter of delivering those next year, obviously, but not expecting some big miracle layer for the end market to change substantially. If it does, it will actually be an opportunity for us. But right now, if you just assume a 10%, even in this bad environment in FY '24, we're close to 10%. So there's no reason to expect automotive to be substantially lower than 10%. And then if you take health care and maybe a 5% growth, again, it's a very modest growth. If you add up this AI automotive and health care alone, that's about $2 billion of revenue. You're talking about 5% to 6% margin, even more if you get leverage out of it. So at 6%, you're talking $120 million of that $130 million, $140 million incremental income that I mentioned is needed for the $10.65. It's already there in just these three end markets and the balance of all the end markets. And I'm talking about semi cap, which, by the way, is showing very strong signs of a recovery that's coming. It's not here, but a lot of customers have changed the way they talk about their own businesses, and that's changing quite a bit in the positive direction. So we do expect not this year, we're not talking about calendar year '24. But in calendar year '25, we do expect very high probity of sharpish sort of recovery there. Renewables totally agree, it's slowing. Digital print and retail, steady Eddie and then connected devices as the basin FY '24 is so low that even a small little increase there you certainly see the $130 million, $140 million of income that we're talking about is not difficult to get to. And then if you look at the margin play, obviously, there\u2019s mix going on, this mix shift that we continue to talk about. And the cost optimization, you\u2019ll also have a full year impact of our cost optimization efforts that we\u2019ve undertaken in FY \u201824. So I hope I answered your question from a risk perspective. Look, the risk is very low. If you look at \u2013 if you break down the individual components of what we\u2019re talking about for FY \u201825, the $10.65 sounds highly achievable.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nMichael Dastoor: Welcome, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. The company mentioned an expectation to have about $6 billion of AI-related revenue in fiscal '25. Better understand how you're defining AI-related revenue? And then maybe also help us understand out of that $6 billion, how much is coming from data center and then how much are some of these other end market opportunities where you see some AI opportunities like health care?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. Hey, Mark. So the blend of it is as -- I would say that probably just north of half of it is data center related maybe slightly -- maybe two-thirds of it and the balance would be optics and advanced switching really. It's that kind of order of magnitude.\nMichael Dastoor: And Mark, if I could just add, if you look at our data center revenue and again, remind you that's net revenue. It's net of consignment effect. Our gross volumes are growing at a really good pace. It's in that 25%, 30% growth range obviously doesn't show up in the revenue. But it will show up in the margin because that is what we're adding value on. So I think the number by itself, just the revenue number, net revenue can be a little misleading. You've got to look through -- look at volumes. Volumes are going up 25%, 30% in that particular space.\nMark Delaney: Okay. That's helpful. But just to clarify, so would any rack for hyperscale or be counted as AI or does it need to have GPUs in it? Just trying to understand sort of the categorization of AI versus some of these other broader categories.\nMichael Dastoor: No, it has to have some GPU attached. Most of our business now has shifted from the legacy server business to AI-related GPU, predominantly in our cloud business.\nAdam Berry: Yeah. We just -- we opened a new facility like six months ago that's pretty much all doing a GPU like -- in that space.\nMark Delaney: Helpful. My other question was on margins. Mike, you mentioned fixed cost recoveries is one reason for the margin resiliency in fiscal '24. Maybe you can help us speak to how secure the recoveries are? Is that something that you still need to go out and negotiate? And then maybe talk a little bit around your ability to still achieve a 6% EBIT margin over the longer term. Thanks.\nMichael Dastoor: Yeah. The recoveries are already done, Mark. It's not based on our future event. It's already agreed upon. So it's very secure. Can you repeat your second question?\nMark Delaney: Your ability to get to the 6% EBIT margin in the longer term, which is something I think you said could be achievable. I don't think you put a specific time frame on it, but to what extent do you think you're still tracking to eventually get a 6% or higher non-GAAP EBIT margin? Thanks.\nMichael Dastoor: Right. So we will exit at FY '24 at 5.6%. We're being very sort of conservative by saying 5.7% plus for FY '25. I think getting to 6% is not is not five years from there. It's maybe a year or so away from FY '25. So we're getting closer and closer to that 6%. And I think the margin story is definitely in our favor right now. It's all the business that we're seeing. That is all higher margin mix shift.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Melissa Fairbanks with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I was wondering, if we could dig into the expectation for health care. I know it's not quite as exciting as AI. But we've heard from some of your peers that capital equipment investment has been challenged recently I assume that's what's behind your lower full year outlook. But you actually found increasingly constructive about the overall business. Could you give us a little more color on what you're seeing there?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. Hey, Melissa. Yeah. I mean we kind of break that up -- if I think about how we break it up entirely, there's med devices, pharma and ortho. What we see in the first half of the year was our expectation is like a little bit softer kind of inventory digestion. But we think that recovers and kind of made the bases and a mean pharma with GLP-1. We see that going really, really strongly. So we think that's -- we're pretty much running our factories, obviously, round the clock there. We think in med devices, we see some recovery there, and also is still a little bit soft but getting better. So I think we\u2019re looking at I think our back half of our year is 8% stronger than the front half as inventory is digested, and we\u2019re comfortable with that number. So we think we are pretty comfortable that our health care business is going to continue. I think Mike mentioned 5% growth next year. We got enough kind of in entire and opportunities for us to be comfortable with that as we go forward.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay. Great. That\u2019s all from me. I\u2019ll pass it along and give some else another question.\nKenny Wilson: Hey. Thanks, Melissa. All the best.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of George Wang with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to double click on the AI, you talked about revenue growing 20%, 25% kind of pre to north of $6 billion in FY '25. I just want to see if you can elaborate on the margin profile kind of within specific subsegments within AI. You talked about the GPU [indiscernible] kind of the optics, switching transceivers power, are you able to rank order, at least in a high level how you think about margin structure in terms of taking order, which specific to the element within the overall AI envelope will garner the highest margin kind of vice versa.\nMichael Dastoor: So yeah, the AI piece, obviously, the different line items that we look at I said earlier, it's in cloud, it's a networking in storage. The margin is north of enterprise level margin. It's different. The rank order would be roughly sort of photonics would be the highest margin, AI switching gear would be next switch and Rax's configuration integration, etc. So overall, if you look at all these dynamics, the total margin plays north of enterprise margins. So again, that's what's giving us comfort for our margin in FY '24. That's what's giving us comfort for margins in FY '25 as well.\nGeorge Wang: Got you. In terms of the customer base, obviously, Amazon being one of the bigger players within the AI segment. Can you kind of talk briefly other kind of whether other hyperscale\u2019s in there or maybe Tier 2, Tier 3 cloud. Any color there?\nKenny Wilson: Yeah. We got -- if you look at predominant [indiscernible] you look at the proliferation of other capabilities. So we are supplying other hyperscalers across the whole blend of the capabilities that we talk about there, George. And I think the other thing just to emphasize that what Mike mentioned, Look, we've been doing enterprise switches for multiple years. And as that becomes to some commoditized we've pivoted in that the capability that we have there to the advanced switching area that really drives the AI TPU type model. So I think that, coupled with what we\u2019re doing in optics means that we\u2019re comfortable that our margin profile is robust here. And I go back to the point I made with Steve about all the kind of DCI, the infrastructure stuff we\u2019re doing as well, which historically we hadn\u2019t done. So we think we got a real rich profit pool here for us in the longer term.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.\nKenny Wilson: You got it, George. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Samik Chatterjee. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you to expand on the incremental weakness that you are seeing on the 5G side. Like is it relative to some particular set of customers or some particular region? Any more color on that? Thank you.\nMichael Dastoor: Yeah. So what we see is we are seeing \u2013 and if you look at telco customers generally, pretty much all come out with a really, really soft outlook for calendar we baked most of that in, but there is some continued weakness there and that\u2019s North America and also across the world. The biggest impact in 5G was the rollout in India where, I mean, basically, the rollout stopped. So it\u2019s paused. We don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to restart. But there\u2019s still a significant amount of radios that have got to be installed in the Indian market, so that demand doesn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s just paused. We are pretty much single sourced in India. We build those radios in our facility in Pune, which we found that facility and our company for 20 some years, so that performed really well. We\u2019re doing a really nice job, and we\u2019re just waiting for the gates to reopen and as we start to build and allow that and get that to be installed in the network, so that will come back. We just didn\u2019t expect it to stop. I mean, completely stopped with no future demand we\u2019ve taken the demand there for the balance of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Adam Berry for closing report.\nAdam Berry: Thanks for your interest in Jabil. Please reach out to us, if you have any further questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following: First, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for Q3 and updated outlook for FY '24. Next, I'll provide an update on why we are confident in our growth opportunities for FY '25. And then, I'll provide an update on our accelerated share buyback execution plans, which are progressing ahead of schedule. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our third quarter guidance. Towards the end of our second quarter, we experienced a sudden slowdown within our 5G and renewable energy end markets, which we expect will continue through the second half of FY '24 and result in lower than expected revenue for the last two quarters. Within our renewable energy business, the inventory correction that began in our Q1 is now expected to persist through the balance of our fiscal year as customers in this end market lower demand forecast towards the back half of February. The renewable energy team has done an excellent job consolidating the supply chain within our current customer base and we will have a higher overall share of our customers' business as we move towards the end of Q4. In 5G, towards the end of the quarter, infrastructure rollout slowed quicker than expected as faster growing markets like, India substantially pull back on all 5G infrastructure investments. As a result of these two market dynamics for Q3, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion. Core operating income for Q3 is estimated to be in the range of $325 million to $385 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $221 million to $301 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $1.38. Net interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be $75 million. Now moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. At a high level, with the exception of the near-term dynamics within our renewable energy and 5G markets, the majority of our expectations for revenue by end market this year remains largely in line with our pots in December. Importantly, for the year, we continue to expect year-on-year growth across some of our core end markets, which are still experiencing year-on-year growth, notably in electric vehicles, health care and AI cloud data centers. Moving to the next slide. Despite the revenue headwinds in the near term, we are confident that we will Jabil to be more resilient as we've diversified across geographies, products, customers and end markets. Because of this, we're not anticipating the same level of margin erosion traditionally seen in past slowdowns. Our diversified approach, global footprint and strong relationships with customers give us confidence in weathering these near-term challenges. We're adapting, staying focused on margins and cash flow and committed to delivering value. Notably, by FY '24, we expect core operating margins to come in higher than we expected in December at 5.6%. Three reasons largely account for our ability to drive margins higher despite lower revenue. First, as our agile model allows, we pushed our planned investments and costs that will plan to support new ramps in renewables in the back half of the fiscal year, because of this, deleveraging is limited. Second, we expect to offset lower revenue with fixed cost recoveries from 5G and renewable energy customers. And third, we made progress with our efforts to align our cost structure and footprint with our go-forward business. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core operating margins of 5.6% in FY '24 and positions us well for future margin expansion as we drive revenue growth higher on an optimized cost structure. Putting it all together for FY '24 on the next slide. We expect our improved mix of business and optimization efforts will drive incremental operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core operating margin guidance to 5.6%, for FY '24 on revenue of $28.5 billion. We expect this dynamic to result in core EPS of $8.40, which is reflected by improved core operating income margin and accelerated share repurchases. Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating more than $1 billion in free cash flow. Moving to the next slide. Overall, we feel good about the trajectory of our end market portfolio and are well positioned to drive growth in FY '25 and headlined by continued growth in automotive, health care and AI data centers along with anticipated recoveries in areas of our business that are contracted this year. Globally, both EV and hybrid platforms continue to outpace ICE unit growth rates, albeit at a lower rate than we had originally anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Our EV business is supporting a number of new vehicle platforms with multiple customers in areas such as next-gen compute and control modules, power conversion battery management, LIDAR and other sensors as well as charging solutions. Additionally, we were recently awarded new business in optical camera modules where OEMs are redeploying optics hardware capabilities, enabling the rollout of different levels of autonomous driving through software updates. It is important to note the majority of the year-on-year growth we expect in EDs in FY '25 will be driven by new programs and will be less reliant on volume growth with existing customers. These new platforms gives us confidence in our expectations of another year of growth for EVs in FY '25. Longer term, Jabil is well positioned to support both EV and hybrid technologies as they continue to take a larger overall share of auto unit growth globally. Within our health care business, we see significant opportunity to offer critical solutions and capabilities to customers outsourcing complex tasks. Jabil's credibility in health care as the largest EMS provider in the space positions us well to take advantage of the growing outsourcing of manufacturing trend. In FY '25, we anticipate another year of growth in our base business as we continue to explore opportunities in new capabilities and B2B transactions similar to our strategic collaboration from a few years ago. And in the data center space, there is a common theme forming among a number of our end markets related to the surge of investments in AI and ML. The pace of AI investments continues to accelerate, and Jabil is winning our fair share of this growing pie as we have positioned ourselves well to assist our customers build out next-generation AI data centers. Our teams are quickly diversifying and winning share across multiple end markets in the AI data center infrastructure space, where we're seeing growth in AI GPU right configurations accelerated optical switches for AI back end networking applications, silicon photonics, liquid cooling capabilities and power and energy storage. Given our success to date in this space, we now expect AI related net revenue across multiple end markets to be approximately $6 billion in FY '25, or an increase of 20% year-on-year. Within the semi-cap market, we continue to anticipate demand to remain muted for FY '24. However, overall market dynamics are expected to improve as commentary across the industry suggests recovery may be on the horizon with a growing expectation that things improve towards the end of this calendar year, as fab utilization ticks higher and memory inventory normalizes. And in renewables, as we look to FY '25, while we expect this end market to recover very slowly, we are winning new business and market share along with the aforementioned consolidation within our current customer base. Longer-term, we remain well-positioned to support secular growth in the renewable energy infrastructure space due to Jabil's unique combination of power engineering expertise, in-region manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. Looking forward, we're excited about the underlying momentum across our diversified portfolio and are well-positioned to drive growth in FY '25. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchases. In December, I outlined our intentions of executing a series of accelerated buybacks for the balance of the $2.5 billion repurchase authorization in FY '24. I'm happy to say that we're ahead of schedule with $825 million repurchased in Q2. This brings our year-to-date repurchase amount to 10.4 million shares for $1.3 billion for an average purchase price just under $127 per share. We fully anticipate completing the remaining $1.2 billion on our current repurchase authorization in FY '24 and we'll continue to opportunistically optimize our repurchases. With the plan in place and progress to date, I expect WASO to be in the range of $123 million to $126 million for FY '24 and approximately $110 million to $113 million in FY '25. On the next slide, in summary, for FY '25, I'm excited about the underlying momentum across our diversified portfolio, and I'm confident that we're well positioned to drive multiple paths of growth in FY '25 as a result of the following: consolidation of share in the renewable energy space, expected recovery of the semi-cap end market, confirmed market share gains with multiple existing customers, new programs booked with new customers, and I am particularly excited about our silicon to solution strategy, which will help accelerate the infrastructure that will be required to fuel the AI/ML macro trend in the market. This is borne out in the continuing mix shift of our networking and storage end market where we continue to replace legacy lower margin networking equipment with higher margin AI driven equipment. On top of all this, when you consider our optimized cost structure, we are well-positioned to expand core margins to more than 5.7%. In addition, our accelerated share repurchases and expected lower net interest expenses gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core EPS of $10.65 in FY '25. In my view, Jabil has not just more diversified, but also significantly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets, which offer higher returns and multiyear secular growth opportunities. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Kenny. Hey, Steve. Yeah. So obviously, the mix shift does have a huge impact. We've replaced a lot of our legacy networking and storage business with higher margin AI related business there, obviously, AI by itself in the cloud space, although, you don't see it in the revenue line item because of the consignment effect, the volumes are up considerably in that particular line item. So there's a big margin play coming through on the mix shift that you suggested. And on top of that, we've done a lot of cost optimization. If you go look back at our -- I think on the call maybe earlier in the fiscal year, we talked about a stranded cost and footprint optimization restructuring that we've taken then. The fruits of that are showing up in the second half of the year. Obviously, we had Q2 was a little bit of a transition quarter for the cost optimization effort. But that's coming through. And then if you look at some of the cost recoveries that we're getting from our customers, even though revenues are down, we are -- we have been successful in getting cost recoveries because of the sudden nature of the cut. So all of that plus Q3, Q4 had some ramps in there. Obviously, as the revenue is pushed out, we don't have to have those ramps. And then I'll just remind you, ramps are at a much lower margin in those initial quarters when we're moving up on that revenue line item. So that gets pushed out a little as well. So a combination of all that, Steve, gives us really good comfort. I think we said 5.3% to 5.5% margin. Previously, we've actually taken it up, not just to the high end. We've taken it beyond that, and we think it's going to be more in the 5.6% range, and we feel really good about that. Hey, Ruplu. Just to be clear, I said AI 21 times in my reports, so I did count. On the AI piece, so if you look at my prepared remarks, Ruplu, I did talk about the AI revenue. I think we're going to grow by about 20%, 25%. We're about in the $4.5 billion, $5 billion range, we're going to be north of $6 billion in FY '25 and that's across multiple end markets. Obviously, as Kenny mentioned, we'll be playing in the cloud data infrastructure space. We play in areas such as network switching. There's a whole bunch of business that was switching from or replacing from our legacy network business to AI-related business. Sort of its spread out, particularly in those two line items when we call them out on our revenue chart. But overall, about $6 billion plus, we actually feel that will continue to grow in that 20%, 30% range over time as this proliferation of AI across different end markets just continues to expand. So it's starting off where you expect it to start in the cloud space. And then as you work around the cloud space, that will gain more momentum. And then as you go forward, and I'm talking here two years out, even that was spread into all our other end markets as well because all that we do is mainly hardware and all hardware will benefit from the AI proliferation. And Ruplu, I'm going to answer your question in a slightly different way than you were at it. Obviously, you asked about the risk and what can go wrong and why the margin story holds good for us. So let me just try and answer it by talking about the $10.65 a little bit. Because all of that is factored into our $10.65 guide. Why do I feel so strongly about that particular $10.65 number. Before that, let me just give you some building blocks. So if you look at what our interest costs this year will be in the high 200s. We expect next year to be in the mid-$200 million. So if you take an interest number of about $250 million for the building block there, if you take WASO (ph), we will have done substantially the $2.5 billion will be completed by FY '24. In FY '25, we'll continue a more normalized run rate of buyback. So I expect WASO to be about $110 million to $113 million in FY '25. Now based on these two numbers, if you take the incremental income that's needed to make $10.65, the numbers are around $130 million to $140 million of incremental income. I talked about some of the end markets, how we're sort of benefiting from some other macro trends that are coming into play right now. I talked about AI, I talked about the different end markets within storage, in cloud, et cetera, where we're seeing this whole AI proliferation. And that alone, as I mentioned, is about $1 billion to $1.5 billion incremental revenue, net revenue, I should add as well, sort of net of any consignment effect that FY '25 presents. We've talked about -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks, automotive, what we're seeing for FY '25 and our assumption is not based on end market growth. Our assumption is based on new program wins. We're talking about wins that we already have under the belt. We've already booked those and it's just a matter of delivering those next year, obviously, but not expecting some big miracle layer for the end market to change substantially. If it does, it will actually be an opportunity for us. But right now, if you just assume a 10%, even in this bad environment in FY '24, we're close to 10%. So there's no reason to expect automotive to be substantially lower than 10%. And then if you take health care and maybe a 5% growth, again, it's a very modest growth. If you add up this AI automotive and health care alone, that's about $2 billion of revenue. You're talking about 5% to 6% margin, even more if you get leverage out of it. So at 6%, you're talking $120 million of that $130 million, $140 million incremental income that I mentioned is needed for the $10.65. It's already there in just these three end markets and the balance of all the end markets. And I'm talking about semi cap, which, by the way, is showing very strong signs of a recovery that's coming. It's not here, but a lot of customers have changed the way they talk about their own businesses, and that's changing quite a bit in the positive direction. So we do expect not this year, we're not talking about calendar year '24. But in calendar year '25, we do expect very high probity of sharpish sort of recovery there. Renewables totally agree, it's slowing. Digital print and retail, steady Eddie and then connected devices as the basin FY '24 is so low that even a small little increase there you certainly see the $130 million, $140 million of income that we're talking about is not difficult to get to. And then if you look at the margin play, obviously, there's mix going on, this mix shift that we continue to talk about. And the cost optimization, you'll also have a full year impact of our cost optimization efforts that we've undertaken in FY \u201824. So I hope I answered your question from a risk perspective. Look, the risk is very low. If you look at \u2013 if you break down the individual components of what we're talking about for FY \u201825, the $10.65 sounds highly achievable. Welcome, Ruplu. And Mark, if I could just add, if you look at our data center revenue and again, remind you that's net revenue. It's net of consignment effect. Our gross volumes are growing at a really good pace. It's in that 25%, 30% growth range obviously doesn't show up in the revenue. But it will show up in the margin because that is what we're adding value on. So I think the number by itself, just the revenue number, net revenue can be a little misleading. You've got to look through -- look at volumes. Volumes are going up 25%, 30% in that particular space. No, it has to have some GPU attached. Most of our business now has shifted from the legacy server business to AI-related GPU, predominantly in our cloud business. Yeah. The recoveries are already done, Mark. It's not based on our future event. It's already agreed upon. So it's very secure. Can you repeat your second question? Right. So we will exit at FY '24 at 5.6%. We're being very sort of conservative by saying 5.7% plus for FY '25. I think getting to 6% is not is not five years from there. It's maybe a year or so away from FY '25. So we're getting closer and closer to that 6%. And I think the margin story is definitely in our favor right now. It's all the business that we're seeing. That is all higher margin mix shift. So yeah, the AI piece, obviously, the different line items that we look at I said earlier, it's in cloud, it's a networking in storage. The margin is north of enterprise level margin. It's different. The rank order would be roughly sort of photonics would be the highest margin, AI switching gear would be next switch and Rax's configuration integration, etc. So overall, if you look at all these dynamics, the total margin plays north of enterprise margins. So again, that's what's giving us comfort for our margin in FY '24. That's what's giving us comfort for margins in FY '25 as well. Yeah. So what we see is we are seeing \u2013 and if you look at telco customers generally, pretty much all come out with a really, really soft outlook for calendar we baked most of that in, but there is some continued weakness there and that's North America and also across the world. The biggest impact in 5G was the rollout in India where, I mean, basically, the rollout stopped. So it's paused. We don't know when it's going to restart. But there's still a significant amount of radios that have got to be installed in the Indian market, so that demand doesn't go away. It's just paused. We are pretty much single sourced in India. We build those radios in our facility in Pune, which we found that facility and our company for 20 some years, so that performed really well. We're doing a really nice job, and we're just waiting for the gates to reopen and as we start to build and allow that and get that to be installed in the network, so that will come back. We just didn't expect it to stop. I mean, completely stopped with no future demand we've taken the demand there for the balance of the year."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Fiscal '24 was always going to be a transitional year for Jabil, one of which we've successfully completed the largest transaction in the company's history with the mobility sale and its subsequent efforts by our teams to optimize our footprint and cost structure for the go-forward company. For this transaction and the optimization of our footprint were anticipated, the end market slowdown was not. As I have stated previously, the key attribute of our model is agility and our ability to quickly react and effectively absorb changes in revenue. At Jabil, we obsess about operations, working tirelessly to ensure that what is within our control, we control well. Managing our factories to absorb such a March slowdown does not happen by chance, so it's pleasing to see our margins hold up. Additionally, dislocations like this provide opportunity for some consolidation and is reassuring to make progress with customers who trust us to allocate more of their spend to Jabil. In tandem with our focus on operational execution, we have been intentional in how we've shaped our commercial portfolio. The closing of the mobility deal was not a one-off event, but part of a process where we look telling our capabilities current and future with markets exhibiting the desirable characteristics of long term secular growth at appropriate margins and cash flows. The result of this allows us to help simplify the lives of our current and future customers while making appropriate returns. For example, in our recent history, this has seen us transition from low tech electronics and automotive to EV and autonomous driving systems, including optical cameras. From PCBA manufacturing and health care to precision machining of customized implantable, from build-to-print servers to highly configurable AI data center racks, from simple network switches to liquid cooled accelerated switching supporting AI applications and from build-to-print in the telco space, starting a seat at the table, as we look to optimize our advanced packaging value chain for silicon photonics across multiple end markets. In short, we are continuously retailing the company to ensure we are ready to support the future needs of our customers. In addition to the mobility deal, another couple of proof points were evident in the quarter. We are proud to have been awarded a new video security and optics business with Motorola Solutions, including two highly competent manufacturing sites in North America. This supports a focus on supply chain regionalization where we see significant benefits from the ability to leverage our global footprint coupled with the advantage of being domiciled in the U.S. And in the AI data center infrastructure space, we are building low and medium voltage switchgear to support proliferation of AI data centers. We were awarded a liquid cooled accelerated network switching program, which will ramp in fiscal year '25. While already, we are seeing the benefits of the addition of the Intel Silicon Photonics team with multiple wins in the pluggable transceiver space. As I think about exiting this year as a more optimized company, coupled with the numerous opportunities across our commercial portfolio, I'm confident in our ability to expand margins year-on-year while also delivering core EPS of $10.65 and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Note that in modeling fiscal year '25, we anticipate total revenues similar to fiscal year '23 levels, excluding the mobility divestiture. Importantly, we expect mix to be much improved as our business continues to trend toward markets, benefiting from long-term secular trends. In closing, in the last 90 days, I have had the privilege of spending time with multiple customers and internal organizations, including executive team at Motorola Solutions, as we celebrated the new award. In addition to the Jabil team from Retronix, Procurability and Intel and with our teams in Asia as we celebrated Chinese New Year with a long held Jabil [indiscernible] tradition. While in Asia, it was also my honor to accept a Shingo prize awarded to our health care site in Shanghai, the largest med device side to receive this award in the last 15 years. As I reflect on all of this, I believe it further demonstrates that in addition to having the right capabilities and being in the right end markets, we also have the right team to buy their actions every day, strengthen our unique global culture. All of this puts us on firm footing for fiscal '25 and beyond. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now hand the call back to Adam. Hi, Steven. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah. Let me take that, the question on demand. I mentioned in Q1 when we've seen the broad-based demand reduction that we've got a process where we do we're pretty intimate with our customers in terms of their forecast, looking at inventory and inventory in channels. We called that right across all of our end markets with the exception of the 5G telco space and renewables. And there's a couple of specifics there. So Mike mentioned the India issue here, and I think what we see here is that although, we said, there was a substantial pullback. In effect, what happened was the rollout stopped with -- basically with no input from the Reliance in this instance. So when we look at that, there's no indication of that and basically, we've baked into our number now going forward. So we're comfortable that everything else in the telco space, we've seen and we understood. This was just a gotcha in India. We're not forecasting or expecting that to recover in this year. So we think we're pretty safe there. In the renewable space, again, we've been working with the customer through calendar Q4 into Q1. And what we decided to do there is that basically, the inventories in the channel, and it's not going to be sold through. So we've reduced the build plan, they've register what they're going to ship. And what we're seeing is that the inventory in channel now is now reducing. We haven't forecasted a covering that this year also. So we've been very, very conservative. Also, just as we look to '25, we've been very conservative, and we've modeled those run rates going forward into '25. So when you look at what we're talking about in '25, we don't expect these two end markets to recover. So we think we've been appropriately conservative. Yeah. I have a follow-up to that also, Steve, and we've been talking about this and obviously, with yourself. But I think Slide 17 is a pretty good pictorial view of why we're confident that our margins in the longer term will be robust. Historically, we would be in the server space here when I think back three, four, five years ago. And then what we're trying to show here is just how as well as being vertical in terms of going to asset like rack assembly that's been hugely successful for us. But if you look at everything else interest we've gone from being a legacy enterprise switching to accelerated switching that supports AI with the awards that we won recently. Optical transceivers or pluggable transceivers in this instance that we got a lot of horsepower from the Intel deal that we just closed. And incidentally, I met with the Intel team in Singapore in January and the hit the ground running and are really making a huge difference, which is great for us. But there's things like the CDUs, liquid cooled racks, and also, we're now doing, as I mentioned, the low voltage bid voltage switchgear and the rack power distribution. So historically, that's markets that we wouldn't be planning in at all. But what we find is from being a server player to now we're getting multiple income streams in that space -- with things where a little bit of the data center being disaggregated. It just gives us confidence when I said that we're retail in the company, what I was talking about is we're leveraging things that we've done historically will listen to our customers, and we're finding other value-added activities so we can help them. We can reduce their costs and we can increase our margins. So I think that can underpin what we try to do from a margin perspective to satisfy our customers' needs grow our margins and make that sustainable in the longer term. You're welcome. And let me take your second question, Ruplu, on Jabil's competitive advantage. Firstly, what I would say is, I think that the growth in this area means that there's going to be a lot of work for a lot of people. So I think that's good. When we look at our competitors, I think there's enough work to go around. That said, what we try to do is we try to look at the world through the eyes of our customers and make their life simpler. And then if you look at -- there's a need in the data centers to be able to do silicon photonics transceivers. These need to be able to do power and switching. There's a need to be able to do servers need to be able to do rack assembly. What we find our customers look to do is their life becomes -- the more suppliers they add, the more and more complicated the life becomes. So if they have a credible supplier that can do multiple different activities, then that's helpful for them. You take, for example, if you can do pluggable transceivers, but you don't do line cars and then you want to put the optical device on a line card. That becomes an issue as we can do both of that. So we think the view for us is to be able to be vertical and to be able to integrate more services that becomes a play for us. is something that we've seen across automotive, Mike mentioned the cameras that we're producing in automotive, for example. So we think that, that serves us well, the other thing that I think remains to be seen, but I think it's basically not a negative but a positive for sure. We have a global footprint, so we can leverage best practices and capabilities across the world, but being domiciled in North America, we see has been helpful in the longer term from a secure supply perspective. So we think we put all of that together, we feel that we're well positioned, and all we got to do is perform. So we're pretty bullish on the long-term opportunities and growth in this area. Yeah. So let me take a step back, Ruplu, because we've reflected on that a lot. The relationships we've got with our customers is -- and generally has been long term in some instances, has been multi-decades. So we have a partnership there. We're kind of joined at the hip connected. We've got processes where we share forecasts. We look at inventory. So we're pretty tight. We've got people in our sites, whether it's business development people, planners, et cetera, et cetera, that are involved in this. So this isn't the top down. It's -- we bubble this up from the bottom. So -- and I can understand the question. In Q1, we've seen a broad-based reduction. And if I look forward from what we when we looked at Q2, across the majority of our end markets, what we predicted is going to happen for the balance of the year is happening. So we're comfortable with that. And sometimes you get out higher, like India, for example, I mean, no one expected with the rate -- the deployment of radios in India that, that would just all of a sudden stop. So I think that, that in this instance, that becomes something that you got accept that sometimes things will happen. In the renewable space, we spend a lot of time with -- we've got more customers now than we had six months ago. And we spend a lot of time with them. It's clear that the slowdown and the rollout of the inventory we got in channel has been much lower than expected. We've taken our numbers way, way down. But in that also, we look -- it's mainly a residential play that's been soft. We are pivoting so that we are much more in the commercial side, and that's been supported by our customers. We're also -- we're winning market share, and there's been a lot of consolidation to Jabil in that space lightly. And if you read the it seems like the commercial space in the U.S. is becoming more robust and we'll be building that in North America also. So we're getting share. We're taking our numbers down significantly. The balance of our business, we think, is holding up. So we think we're really at the bottom here. But what I would like to add though a little bit to your question is -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got to be really, really good at control in what we can control. Whether this has been a pullback, slowdown, recession, inventory correction, whatever you want to call it, if we look back in our company's history, the last couple of times this has happened. Our EPS has gone down by 40% or margins by 100 basis points or more. Here, we're working really hard, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, to make the company much more resilient and robust. So I think that we demonstrate that in spite of shops in a couple of our end markets that that our businesses has taken a couple of punches, but staying remarkably resilient. So my message to investors would be that sometimes like outliers happen. But I think it was improving our margins and I think 840 EPS, I think it demonstrates that our company is much more robust than it was historically. Yeah. Hey, Mark. So the blend of it is as -- I would say that probably just north of half of it is data center related maybe slightly -- maybe two-thirds of it and the balance would be optics and advanced switching really. It's that kind of order of magnitude. Yeah. Hey, Melissa. Yeah. I mean we kind of break that up -- if I think about how we break it up entirely, there's med devices, pharma and ortho. What we see in the first half of the year was our expectation is like a little bit softer kind of inventory digestion. But we think that recovers and kind of made the bases and a mean pharma with GLP-1. We see that going really, really strongly. So we think that's -- we're pretty much running our factories, obviously, round the clock there. We think in med devices, we see some recovery there, and also is still a little bit soft but getting better. So I think we're looking at I think our back half of our year is 8% stronger than the front half as inventory is digested, and we're comfortable with that number. So we think we are pretty comfortable that our health care business is going to continue. I think Mike mentioned 5% growth next year. We got enough kind of in entire and opportunities for us to be comfortable with that as we go forward. Hey. Thanks, Melissa. All the best. Yeah. We got -- if you look at predominant [indiscernible] you look at the proliferation of other capabilities. So we are supplying other hyperscalers across the whole blend of the capabilities that we talk about there, George. And I think the other thing just to emphasize that what Mike mentioned, Look, we've been doing enterprise switches for multiple years. And as that becomes to some commoditized we've pivoted in that the capability that we have there to the advanced switching area that really drives the AI TPU type model. So I think that, coupled with what we're doing in optics means that we're comfortable that our margin profile is robust here. And I go back to the point I made with Steve about all the kind of DCI, the infrastructure stuff we're doing as well, which historically we hadn't done. So we think we got a real rich profit pool here for us in the longer term. You got it, George. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Adam.\nAdam Berry: Good morning, and welcome to Jabil's first quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. In terms of our agenda today, we plan to focus on the following: Review our Q1 results, discuss the trends underway within the end markets we serve, and provide Q2 guidance. We'll also reiterate our capital allocation plans, reinforce our core margin and EPS outlook for the year, and in doing so provide you with the detail as to why we feel confident in achieving these goals for this year and next, despite our updated outlook as discussed on November 28th. But before we begin, please note that today's call is being webcast live. And during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted for audio playback. I'd now like to ask you to follow along with our presentation with slides on the website. Beginning with a forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our first quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.4 billion in revenue, near the low end of our guidance range provided in September, and in line with our updated expectations announced on November 28. It's worth noting the majority of the year-over-year decline was driven by the previously announced move to a consignment model, where we transitioned certain components we procure and integrate into the cloud space to a customer-controlled consignment services model. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $499 million, or 6% of revenue. This is up 120 basis points year-over-year, due to an improved mix of business, normal seasonal patterns within our mobility business and the previously announced accounting impacts of assets held for sale. Excluding the impact of assets held for sale, core operating margin was roughly 5.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. Net interest expense for the quarter came in $3 million better-than-expected at $70 million, reflecting lower levels of inventory during the quarter as a result of lower revenue and better working capital management by the team. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $303 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.47. Core diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.60, a 13% improvement over the prior year quarter and at the midpoint of the range we provided in September. Now, turning to the performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $4.8 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year, driven by continued weakness from our connected devices end market. These declines were partially offset by year-over-year growth in our automotive and transportation and healthcare businesses. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 7%, a 180 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, given solid mix, normal seasonal pattern within our mobility business, and the aforementioned previously announced accounting impact of assets held for sale. Excluding the impact of assets held for sale associated with the mobility sale, core operating margins for DMS were 6%. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.6 billion, down roughly 21% year-over-year. This decline was driven by our move to a consignment model and a softening in demand in end markets like 5G, networking and digital print. Given this combination of consignment and mix, core margins for the EMS segment were an impressive 4.6%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q1, beginning with inventory, which improved two days sequentially to 78 days. Net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 58 in Q1, consistent with our strong Q4 performance. Our first quarter cash flows from operations came in at $448 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $275 million, resulting in $173 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $500 million, leaving us with $2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of November 30. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.6 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.1 times. So, in summary, Q1 was largely a very good quarter. While our topline growth came in a bit lower-than-expected, the team still delivered good year-over-year growth in core margins, core EPS and adjusted free cash flow. At the same time, we were incredibly active in terms of repurchasing our own shares and we made solid progress on the sale of our mobility business. With that, thank you. I'll now hand it over to Kenny.\nKenny Wilson: Thanks, Adam; and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, on November 28, we announced a reduction in our outlook for fiscal year 2024 based on a broad slowdown of demand across multiple end markets. In short, customers adjusted demand schedules as they reacted to a slowdown in end markets heading into the end of the calendar year. Although we feel the slowdown will be temporary in nature, it is incumbent on us to react and adjust our model appropriately to align with our customers' requirements. Agility in our industry is key. Being able to absorb changes in demand signals effectively across our network is a critical part of our value proposition. This agility is part of our DNA and is reflected in our ability to effectively absorb downsides and revenue. Fungible assets, flexible automation, single instance of SAP, common manufacturing execution systems, focus on margin rich value-added services, and multi customer sites set up specifically to manage disparate end markets in one campus are just some examples of disciplines embedded in our model. These core areas of focus are a large part of why we believe we can manage margins consistent with our Q1 guide and EPS at $9 plus, while absorbing a broad-based slowdown. Turning to end markets, where you take a deeper look, we still expect growth in key areas like electric vehicles and renewables, albeit at a modestly slower pace than previously anticipated. In healthcare, our business remains robust and foundational in terms of what we are trying to accomplish at Jabil. Our ability to provide key solutions and capabilities to customers in complex areas where outsourcing is underpenetrated and quality is paramount underpins our confidence that we will continue to grow in this end market. And in cloud, our team continued to drive forward within the AI data center space. Remember, this business moved into a consignment model last year, which makes revenue look unusually low, relative to previous years, while in reality the business is growing volumes by roughly 20%. In connected devices, we've seen softening for some time, and this doesn't seem likely to change in the near-term. While in enterprise, communications and 5G, we continue to expect softness based on global rollouts. Turning to renewables, we've seen softness in solar and wind, driven by a combination of reduced channel inventory sell through, impact of interest rates and incentive uncertainty. Outlook wise, we remain optimistic based on multiple new business wins and some supply chain consolidation within our current customer base. On the sale of our mobility business, I am really pleased with the progress we are making. The selfless collaboration between our teams while working on closing the deal, ensuring the needs of our customer remain top of mind has been really pleasing to see. Focusing on your day job, keeping product flowing, while managing a complex transition is hard. The fact that we are managing this so successfully is another proof point of our belief that BYD Electronics is the correct partner for this transaction. Taken altogether, we now expect revenue not associated with the mobility divestiture to be down 5% year-over-year on a like-for-like basis. Reflecting on all of the above, it's pretty satisfying to see the resilience of our model where despite end market choppiness, we expect to post year-on-year growth in core margins and EPS, while also driving in excess of $1 billion in free cash flows. Further, we remain committed to our previous fiscal year \u201825 guidance, inclusive of margins at 5.6% plus and EPS in excess of $10.65. In closing, I want to share a final thought. In Jabil, we are always planning our future. And as sad as I am to say goodbye to my colleagues as they transition to BYD Electronics, I would like to welcome the procurement services team from procureability and the silicon photonics technical team from Intel as they join our company. Welcome, and we look forward to your contribution as we focus on the next chapter of our company's growth and diversification. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I will now hand the call to Mike.\nMike Dastoor: Thanks, Kenny; and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following. First, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for Q2 and FY \u201824, which remains largely consistent with our announcement on November 28, and then I'll provide an update on our accelerated buyback execution plans. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our second quarter guidance. We anticipate the Mobility transaction to close during Q2 of FY \u201824. The exact date of the close will drive where we land. For Q2, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.6 billion. The midpoint of this range assumes the Mobility transaction closes January 31, which is consistent with our modeling assumptions in September. Core operating income for Q2 is estimated to be in the range of $339 million to $399 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $301 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.73 to $2.13. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.77 to $1.37. Net interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be $62 million. Before turning to our full-year guidance, it's worth noting that our Q2 guidance is materially influenced by the Mobility transaction close date. I thought it would be helpful if I provide you with the financial impact of an earlier close. For modeling purposes, a December close would reduce the midpoint of our Q2 revenue and core EPS outlook ranges by approximately $400 million and $0.30, respectively. For the year, it would also reduce our revenue outlook by $400 million, while the loss in core EPS would be expected to be offset through accelerated repurchases and lower interest expense, given the earlier receipt of net funds. Now, moving on to full-year guidance on the next slide. As we announced a few weeks ago, towards the end of our quarter, we noticed a widespread slowdown in customer demand. The majority of the slowdown we're seeing is being driven by excess inventory in our customers channel, which we view as short-term in nature. In our view, once the excess channel inventory clears up, we're optimistic that the secular trends across our business remain intact and gives us confidence in future growth. It is important to note that Jabil's net inventory days is in good shape and remains consistent with our target range of 55 days to 60 days. For FY \u201824, we expect revenue to be approximately $31 billion for our modeling assumption of a January 31 close for the Mobility transaction. Importantly, for the year, we continue to expect year-on-year growth across the end markets that are experiencing strong multi-year tailwinds, notably in renewable energy, infrastructure, electric vehicles, AI, cloud data centers and healthcare. Moving to the next slide. Despite the revenue headwinds in the near term, we are confident that we build Jabil to be more resilient as we've diversified across geographies, products, customers and end markets. Because of this, we don't expect the same level of margin erosion traditionally seen in past slowdowns. Our diversified approach, global footprint and strong relationships with customers gives us confidence in weathering these near-term challenges. We're adapting, staying focused on margins and cash flow, and committed to delivering value. Notably for FY \u201824, we still expect core operating margins to be in the range of 5.3% to 5.5%. I would now like to walk you through the dynamics of how we are able to maintain margins despite lower revenue. As a reminder, we have completely changed the construct of our business. We're in the process of divesting one of our highest fixed cost businesses. Additionally, four of our end markets, EVs, healthcare, renewables and cloud, are growing volumes year-on-year, albeit at lower levels than previously anticipated, which means deleveraging is limited as we are able to push our planned investments and costs which have not been incurred yet. In addition to pushing our ramp in investment costs, we're also moving ahead with reducing our SG&A in the back half of the year and optimizing our global footprint. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core operating margins in the 5.3% to 5.5% range in FY \u201824. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchases for the year. In Q1, we executed the previously mentioned $500 million accelerated share repurchase. In September, we originally expected to do a series of accelerated buybacks totaling $1.7 billion in FY \u201824 and $800 million in FY \u201825. We now intend to execute a series of accelerated buybacks of the entire $2.5 billion repurchase authorization in FY \u201824. As a result, I now expect WASO to be in the range of $124 million to $127 million for FY \u201824. We also now expect interest expense to be lower this year in the range of $250 million to $260 million, compared to our expectations in September, as we expect working capital levels to decline with lower revenue. All of these actions gives me confidence that we will offset lower income and deliver core earnings for FY \u201824 to be in excess of $9 per share, and our cash flow outlook for the year remains robust and we are committed to delivering adjusted free cash flow in excess of $1 billion in FY \u201824. In my view, Jabil is well positioned to navigate the current economic environment, evidenced by our performance over the past several years. We are not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets, which are undergoing multi-year secular growth. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\nAdam Berry: Thanks, Mike. So, as you can see, we remain well positioned and extremely bullish on the future of Jabil. Thank you for your time. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can you address how you're managing risk in this environment? For example, what gives you confidence in the $31 billion and $9 plus in EPS guidance for fiscal \u201824, given you likely have limited visibility in the second half? The question would be, how weak can revenues be for you to still hit that $9 plus EPS target for this year? And can you also comment on any risk with Jabil's own inventory? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Hey, thanks, Ruplu. So, first of all, let me take the last part of your question there, which is, I think, our model is relatively consistent that we don't take inventory risk. So, everything that we buy is underwritten by a forecast or a purchase order. So, we're pretty comfortable in that. And if you look at where we are in Q1, with the slowdown at 58 days, that's still industry leading. And so, we're pretty confident there. If you look at the way where our company is set up, we run divisions, we've got division leads, and we've then got a leadership team that support that. So, we're pretty intimate with our customers. And all of our team have been very, very active with our customer base. You're looking at what happened in Q1, what's happening for the balance of the year. And the feedback, although nuanced with different impacts in different end markets. And what we see is relatively consistent. And, incidentally, myself, I mean, I've been in Europe and in Asia over the last month meeting a lot of our customers also. So, the feedback is -- and remember, we get forecast, 12-months' forecast pretty much for all of our customers. And we see their feeds, we look at what they're pooling and what they're selling. So, the feedback generally is, look, we expect the next couple of quarters to be inventory correction and we think beyond that we're in decent shape, and we've baked that into what we see for the back half of the year. The other thing I'd like to emphasize is that, in the discussions we're having, and times like this ultimately can be good for us from a consolidation perspective. So, we're pretty active in a number of discussions with our customers about how can we make their business easier by helping them consolidate supply chains, so that their business is simpler to manage. So -- I mean, I would say that we're really close with our customers. The data we get is pretty consistent. And we're monitoring really closely. I mean, we'd like for the inventory to be sold through, but it's not -- and when we think it will be over the next couple of quarters. And -- but we'll bake that into our guide for Q2 for the balance of the year.\nMike Dastoor: And, Ruplu, If I could just add, and if you look at our revenue, while we've taken revenue down by $2.5 billion, about $1 billion of that is the first half. So, we're not taking the second half as it\u2019s absolutely going to recover. We're still being conservative about the second half of the year. There's $1.5 billion coming out. Visibility is a little limited right now, not from our perspective but from our customers' perspective as well. So, we think $1.5 billion to second half is appropriate at this stage. And then if I can, let me just walk you through how we expect EPS to change, because this is a very critical and important piece. If you look at what we provided in September, we said a range of $9.30 to $9.70. If I take a midpoint of $9.50 and start from there, the revenue loss of about bill -- $2.5 billion impacts us by roughly $1.20, and that is sort of the deleveraging. When you're growing year-on-year, especially in the four end markets that we've been focused on, in automotive, healthcare, renewables, cloud, we're growing year-on-year. It's not going down. So, when you grow year-on-year, your deleverage is very limited. You can actually push out a whole bunch of investments and costs and ramps to quarters out from here. So, there's a little bit of nuance here that most people are ignoring in that we are in the right end markets. All of them are still showing growth year-on-year, albeit lower levels, but still year-on-year growth. On some of the lower margin businesses, even if you double the deleveraging there from a 3% or 4% to 8%, you still were losing some level of income, but it's not that much. The margin is not that impacted on the lower margin businesses. And then I talked a little bit about buybacks in my prepared remarks. We completed a $500 million buyback in September. That was huge. That was the biggest buyback we've ever done in a single quarter. And what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we are going to double down on that. So, in September, we'd anticipated doing an additional $1.2 billion in \u201824 and $800 million in \u201825. Now, all of that $2 billion left over is going to be done in FY \u201824. We think this is a good time, it's a good appropriate time to do it when there's a slowdown going in. We still feel we're highly undervalued and buybacks are the best return we can get from our free cash flows, from the proceeds of the funds that we will get once the Mobility divestiture is done. So, it's a bit of a long-winded answer, but you could pick up $0.40, $0.50 quite easily between buyback and lower interest cost as well. Interest will be lower because working capital will be lower because of lower revenue. Plus, after yesterday's news, if interest rates do what the Fed is saying, I think there's a little bit of pickup there as well. So, there's a whole bunch of puts and takes, but we feel pretty strong about the $9 plus.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thank you for all the details there, Mike and Kenny. I appreciate that. Let me ask you a follow up question, which is really the same question for fiscal \u201825. I mean, you're guiding for $10.65 plus EPS and you're maintaining the operating margin target of 5.6% plus. What -- again, the question is, what revenue level do you need to see in fiscal \u201825 to be able to hit that $10.65 target? And you mentioned that you can push out some investments, but is there any risk to doing that in terms of hurting future revenue growth? So, just your thoughts on maintaining the guidance that you had for fiscal \u201825 and how confident you are in that? Thank you so much. I appreciate the details.\nMike Dastoor: Yes. So, Ruplu, if you look at our Q3 and Q4 run rates, obviously we provided $31 billion as the annual revenue number. We've done Q1 and Q2, so you can extrapolate the second half of the year. If you take those run rates into FY \u201825, some small level of recovery, we're not even thinking of a big recovery coming through, some level of new business which is already in the pipeline, by the way, so we're working on multiple new business wins. And, overall, if you -- even from a smaller base, if you grow by 4%, 5%, 6%, the margin, we're going to be doing 5.4% at least at the midpoint from 5.3% to 5.5% that we said in 2024. It's -- 5.6% in \u201825 is not a stretch. So, margins, we expect that to be higher. If you look at the lower WASO, we'll have not only in FY \u201824 as a result of us doing the entire $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in \u201824, there is an impact in \u201825 as well, because you're getting the entire WASO impact in \u201825. So, overall, I think FY \u201825 is in really good shape.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for all the details.\nKenny Wilson: Thanks, Ruplu.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is now live.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you just made on the revenues and how it's playing out by the different served markets. So, you mentioned that new program costs are down, so I guess you're seeing pushouts in certain markets. But then you also mentioned that customer forecasts are coming down, which I assume is for existing programs mainly. So, I was wondering if you could sort of dissect not every single line item, but just sort of big picture where you're seeing more new program pushouts and why and where it's more related to current end demand? And then I had a follow-up.\nKenny Wilson: Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, I would say, I mean, if we -- if I run through our end markets, just to give you some color, so 5G is obviously soft, and you see that from the customers that we serve. A slowdown in end markets there and our network and switching business, we see the kind of campus and enterprise space, softer with an inventory glut, but we're really going great guns and accelerated switching around the AI space. So, that's been pretty positive for us. In healthcare, ortho is down, but pharma and med devices are up. And then in auto, which I think is a part -- in terms of your question about new products, we see the new products getting pushed out there to some degree. What I would always say is that or what we've always said is that, look, we think our auto business is going to be up into the right, but it's not going to be linear, it's going to be lumpy. And we see that. And if you look at the auto market, where people are saying that the expectation is that it's going to grow 20%, 30%, but you look at the inventory in the lots right now. So, we see some push out in automotive. Although to Mike's earlier point, we're still growing pretty nicely there. And then, on renewables, so we look at, kind of, residential slowing down with interest rates, effectively commercial still going reasonably okay. We see a kind of slowdown in energy storage as people wait for the IRA to really get bedded in. But we think the backlog here is going to recover relatively quickly thereafter. So, I think -- I mean, that's some of the key end markets I mentioned in cloud, where AI is really driving our cloud business. We're operating in a new facility to support that. So, we're up there. And so, generally, renewables is a little bit softer with some new product being delayed. We do see consolidation in the renewable space, which I think is going to help us for sure as the industry recovers there. And then -- and automotive is just a push out of some orders, but -- so hopefully that answers your question.\nMike Dastoor: And if I could just add, if you look at EVs, I think, everyone has seen the choppiness, everyone has seen the increased inventories at dealers, et cetera. I think the early adapters have already played out and they've got their EVs. It now becomes a question of cost. All the OEMs, all the EV companies are going to try and get their cost down. Who do you go to when you want to get your cost down? To an EMS company. So, this value proposition that EMS provides from an EV manufacturing perspective, we're well positioned for EVs, we're well positioned for hybrids. If you look at the battery management systems, the compute modules, the optics, all of that, we're in a good space to actually provide some value to OEMs who have to now take their costs down a bit, because that's the second wave of EV will be cost based, not the early adoption wave that we just rode a few quarters ago.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up, Mike, I know you're still saying $1 billion plus for free cash flow, but off of the November announcement, if I just changed the revenue assumptions and kept my working capital turn numbers, the lower sales was like worth $200 million more of free cash flow by my calculation. Is that the type of sort of change in free cash flow we can see off of the revised guidance, or am I missing something?\nMike Dastoor: So, obviously, part of free cash flow is income, Steve. And when you lose $2.5 billion, you do lose income. Even though your margin is maintained, the dollars do come out. So, there is an offset. You're absolutely right on the working capital. Working capital does go down, and that is sort of baked in, but you also lose the income. The other area that we're looking at is CapEx very carefully. We've always been disciplined. In these times, we're even more disciplined and if we're pushing out investments, we're pushing out some level of CapEx that would help free cash flow as well. And it's early days, Steve. That's why we've stuck with the $1 billion plus. But do I expect it to be higher than that? Yes.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. I had just another question related to inventories and free cash flow. You talked about that gross number of days, I think 78 days, which is down. And the net number, I guess, roughly 25% of your inventory is backed by customer deposits. But given that lead times are pretty short for components, wouldn't we assume that customers will want that cash back? In other words, as you reduce inventory, you have to pay them back, and they don't need to give you more cash deposits, because there isn't that need for buffer or the shortage situation that we saw a couple of years ago. And how does that impact the future free cash flow?\nMike Dastoor: So, let me just answer that in a slightly different way than you've asked it. I expected, and I've always expected inventory days to be in the 55 to 60-day range. When inventory goes up, the inventory deposits go up in sync. When inventory days start coming down or normalizing, yes, there is a level of return on the inventory deposits. So, a quick answer to your question is, are we going to see a pop in free cash flow because inventories are going to go down? The answer is no. It's not a pop in free cash flow. It will still be in the 55 to 60 days. It's just a matter of the gross number going down and the inventory deposits going down in sync. So, that's something we're good at managing. That's something we have really good relationships with customers, and we're always working on that particular front. So, no, free cash flow won't get a pop. It's already baked into our numbers at that 55, 60, and that's where it will stay.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Kenny, just back to the pre-announcement from a couple of weeks ago. That came a couple of months after you had guided for the November quarter, and then you saw, obviously, a big cut across your customer base, and you seem to be lagging some of your competitors in terms of what they saw, right. We saw some -- one of your big competitors a month earlier take down numbers in a similar way. So, what do you think the difference is in terms of -- and I know that the supply we were seeing a rolling correction, right, different end markets. But why do you think you're seeing it later than some competitors? Is it because of end markets or because of other reasons?\nKenny Wilson: Yes. I mean, I think, there's a little bit of when people report the results and -- but from our perspective, we've seen that late in our quarter, wherein some of the end markets are nuanced to some degree as of the customers, but generally we've seen it broad-based across our customers. And we also see that a lot of our customers report calendar quarters, and it was really the back end of their announcements where they took actions to reduce our outlook. So, I mean, I would push back quite strongly that our visibility into our customer base is disconnected and that we don't do a good a job of that as our competitors, to be honest. I think, it's just time and based on -- we got that feedback in -- toward the back end of our quarter. So, that would be my answer.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. I appreciate it. Yes, I wasn't suggesting that at all. I was just trying to figure out the perspective. Thank you very much.\nKenny Wilson: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. If I can just start with one on the end markets and just wanted to confirm first, I know you're mentioning broad-based weakness that you saw across your end markets, but just trying to rank out of the weakness that you're seeing and what you're embedding in that sort of $2.5 billion reduction in the guide, looks like it's more autos and industrial and semi-cap and going to, one, confirm that I'm sort of interpreting that right? Secondly, how do you -- just, overall, you're describing a lot of the weakness as temporary, but how do you address concerns on the EV market in particular? When I think the average investor out there is thinking that EV penetration looking five years out is now going to be probably a lot lower than what it was expected to be just given sort of the demand profile we are seeing now. So, any thoughts around how this changes the more sort of long-term growth profile on EVs for you? And I have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you.\nKenny Wilson: Yes. So, let me take the EV one first. And we've always -- I mean, we've grown 40% and we've said that that would slow down this year. I mean, we are still bullish on the EV space in the longer term. And remember that although that the demand moves up and down and we look at this in the longer term, five, six, seven, 10-years. And so, from our perspective -- and then what we do is, we look at where is the demand patterns? And we've got a global footprint. We do things consistently across the globe. So, the fact that there's growth in Asia and it slows down in other markets means that we've got a footprint in each of those regions. We've -- the customer base that we have is really positive, is really -- we've got a really good customer base focused in North America, Europe and in Asia. So, we're able to adapt to changes in demand cycles. And if you look right now in China, where the demand is picking up, we build EVs in China, we've got multiple customers here. So, we think the long-term trend is good there. We think we're in the right areas. We think we're in the right markets, and we think we've got the right capabilities. So, we think it's going to be up and to the right. Is it going to be 20%, 30%, 40%? We think we can adapt it to any of those numbers. So, we're pretty confident in the long-term of our EV strategy. So, in terms of other markets, we're still growing. I think, we said in prepared remarks that our auto business is going to grow at 11%, healthcare and packaging 6%. So, as Mike mentioned, the areas of our business that we're really focused on growing with secular tailwinds, we think are -- still continue to grow. Renewables at 7%. So, yes, we think that we're in a good spot across all of those end markets.\nSamik Chatterjee: And for my follow up, I -- the question that we are getting most from investors on margins today is you mentioned the push out in terms of investment. When you think about margin guidance for next year, is the assumption that some of those investments don't need to sort of be put back into the model next year as you're pushing them out of fiscal \u201824, or is the margin guidance maintained despite assuming those investments come back next year? Thank you.\nMike Dastoor: No. So, I think the way to think of this is the revenue comes out, the cost comes out. When the revenue comes back, as we expect it to be sometime in FY \u201825, those costs will come back, but there will be an offset. So, net-net, the impact on margin will be neutral. I think, we've said 5.3% to 5.5%. I think, we've got to remember we've changed the construct of our business completely. The four end markets do not underestimate that those continue to grow. It's not by chance that we happen to be in those four end markets. Over the last few years, we've intentionally focused on those end markets, because we always thought those were the long-term secular end markets. I think, overall, the way to think about cost push outs, it's completely dependent on whether that revenue is there. If the revenue suddenly comes back, those costs will come back. So, I'm not saying a 5.3% to 5.5% will suddenly jump up if those revenues come back. We have other plans on making margin continue to go up as we continue to change the mix, as we continue to add new operational efficiencies, the automation side, AI/ML, robotics, all of that will continue to provide on an annualized basis, in my view, at least 10 to 20 basis points by itself. And the mix of the business, the revenue piece will provide the balance. So, yes, I think the push outs is completely revenue driven.\nSamik Chatterjee: All right. That's clear. Thank you. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nGeorge Wang: Oh, hey, guys. Yes. Just kind of want to double click on the connected devices. You guys didn't elaborate too much in the prepared remark. Just you guys took down now expecting down 25% versus 15% last time, and kind of on the heels of down 15% last year, FY 2023. Just curious, kind of any mostly broad-based slowdown within the connected devices, or kind of one of the few customers, kind of, driving the weakness. Maybe you can kind of double click there?\nKenny Wilson: Yes. Hey, George, thanks for the question. So, we always talk about connected devices as effectively what we do for consumer. We view that as being an area where we can incubate capabilities that can support us across the rest of our business. What we do find is that we got to be quite selective there, because, A, it's consumer short life cycles you're dependent sometimes and if products are successful or not. Sometimes there's an expectation in margins that the margins will be pretty tight for us. So, it's not a case of us defocusing in that side of our business, but it's a case of us being selective in terms of the margin profile for some specific programs. So, I think, you'll see, and you should see it across our network. And I think to the previous question on margins. Look, we [Technical Difficulty] and that support our capabilities and that support our cash flows and margins. So, I think, in this instance, it's a case of -- it's really maybe one or two other areas of our business where we're just choosing not to engage, because we think that we can add more value for our customers with the capabilities in different end markets.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. That makes sense. I just have a quick follow-up. Just kind of in terms of the AI data center, kind of, in terms of the consignment model shift. How much additional margin you guys can extract from this consignment shift? Obviously, it's additive to the bottom line and the kind of margin profile. And, also, maybe you can talk about kind of slightly more just on the projects ramping within the AI. That's being a pretty popular topic with investors nowadays.\nMike Dastoor: I think, there's multiple ways of looking at the AI piece. AI and the new GPUs that drive our requirements, that drive space requirements, it's going to exponentially continue to sort of grow on an annual basis. The margin stack on what we do today will be relatively stable. It's the new services that we provide, the new value-add that we'll be looking at in terms of liquid cooling, photonics, those are the pieces that we think will be highly margin accretive. I'm not suggesting that will happen immediately, but over time I do expect the AI cloud data centers the margin to go up, that entire stack to be more value-add based.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Vogt from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in. So, maybe, Kenny, one for you first. Obviously, since the pre-release, you've had a couple of weeks to kind of go back and do, sort of, I would imagine, a deeper dive in terms of the categories and what your customers are saying. How do you frame sort of the inventory digestion? I know, at the time, you said, maybe one to two quarters, and I think I heard you say two quarters. Is that kind of the latest feedback that you're hearing from your partners today? And then one for Mike on capital allocation. I think, I heard you say you're going to do the entire $2.5 billion buyback in fiscal 2024. So, I know you normally don't talk about the following year, but what do you think that means for fiscal 2025 in the context of your $10.65 EPS guidance reiteration? Thanks.\nKenny Wilson: Hey, David, thank you. So, on inventory correction, David, as I mentioned, that subsequent to meeting you in Phoenix, our folks have been out meeting our customers, as I have. I would say that the sentiment certainly hasn't got worse, and, if anything, marginally better, but it's still in some areas a quarter, and a lot of areas a couple of quarters. So, it's relatively consistent with what we discussed in Phoenix. So, no change to the negative, maybe just slightly more positive. But just to reemphasize that, the discussions we're having -- what we see is, we are seeing opportunities to -- our customers are looking to consolidate their supply chains with fewer suppliers and that's positive for us -- long-term positive for us.\nMike Dastoor: And, David, from a buyback perspective, you're absolutely right. We're going to try and get the whole $2.5 billion done this year. That not only has a positive impact on WASO in FY \u201824, I think we've said 124 million to 127 million WASO by the end of \u201824. And then for FY \u201825, we'll have a normalized buyback program. And if you look back at our history over the last six, seven, eight, 10 years, we've done about $500 million a year. So, it will be safe again. We don't have the authorization from the Board yet for that FY \u201825. It's early days. But I'd expect that to be in that $500 million range. And when you add all the early buybacks in \u201824 plus that our WASO goes down to $110 million to $115 million depending on share price, so it is the best use of our funds. And I keep saying that with our history, what we've done over the last few years proves that out, that we've been -- we put our money where our mouth is, and we will continue to do so as we feel we're still highly undervalued.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And can I just make a quick follow-up? I think, Mike mentioned lower interest rates could have a stimulative effect on the business. Maybe, Kenny, if you can kind of help us think about where do you think the most impact could be felt by end market, which is the most sensitive to rates? Given your mix, I would imagine more of the...\nKenny Wilson: Renewables for sure.\nDavid Vogt: Right, exactly.\nKenny Wilson: Yes. Renewables for sure. I mean, if we look at our -- we've developed a -- developing really great capabilities in the renewable space and we're kind of just waiting for things to bed down and guidance from -- through with the IRA. But also interest rates for sure are impacting solar rollouts in the residential space. So, I would say, out of all of our businesses -- auto will help us also, obviously, and -- but I think renewables would be the number one. We would expect to see a tailwind there.\nMike Dastoor: I would also expect some level of enterprise level spend to improve. I think, a lot of CFOs have been pulling back on purchases, enterprise level purchases, with interest rates going down. And just the whole macro environment changes on that perspective. So, we do expect other end markets to have an impact. Will it happen immediately? Probably not, but over time it will have a positive impact for us and for almost every other company as well.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Melissa Fairbanks from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hey, guys, thanks very much. Talk about getting in under the wire. I'm curious about the comment that you've made or the comments that you've made on supply chain consolidation in renewables. I know supply chain services, this is one area that's driving more, like, direct customer engagement in your business overall. So, in renewables, are you working directly with these customers managing their supply chain, or is this consolidation happening further downstream?\nKenny Wilson: Yes. Hey, Melissa. So, I would disconnect the two a little bit. So, what -- there's been some announcements from us on supply chain services. We just had our supplier summit actually yesterday and today, which has been fabulous to meet with our suppliers. We've been talking supply chain services for a long time and we're just putting the building blocks in place to make that material for us in the longer term, but obviously to support our customers. In terms of supply chain consolidation, what we're finding is that, and it goes back to, I think, pre-COVID, where the world thought that supply chain diversification was good. So, have multiple suppliers be dual sourced. And then people found out that that was hugely difficult to manage. So, when you get dislocations like this, our customers are thinking, how can I simplify my life? How can I simplify my world? I mean, people look at our inventory relative to our peers and they're saying, well, maybe that's an indicator of that I should be safe with Jabil. And what we see is just discussions around, look, can you -- can we -- can you manage my supply chain? Can you build it in your sites? It gives me less people to engage with as long as you can trust it and you can deliver. So, it really is that and dislocation that's driving those discussions and that's happened. If I look at other times like this, that -- what we've found has been good for our business if you look at the pre to post-COVID. So, we do expect that this will be good for us also in the longer term.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay. All right. Great. Maybe as a follow-up. I'm glad you mentioned silicon photonics a couple of questions ago. I think, this acquisition is really interesting in terms of adding value, but we haven't really talked about it a lot. Does the acquisition of the Intel silicon photonics business, does this bring any revenue along with it, or is it simply about bringing in more of the supply stack internally, and it's already kind of reflected in your business? And then longer term, does this provide more of a competitive moat in AI?\nKenny Wilson: Yes. So, for sure, let me talk about the -- let me just give you a little bit of background on that and then talk about what we're doing. We did an acquisition in 2014 of optical business, a small optical business with a tuck-in capability like we do. And we've been gradually building that. And the key for us was it was in the telco space, but it was always going to be focused on the datacom space in the longer term, that's where we've seen the value. So, we've been growing that capability. It's not hugely material for us, but the capability is something that we think we can develop. So, this Intel opportunity is, it really came out of a discussion with our cloud providers where they're looking for us to -- they're looking to disaggregate supply chains and want us to be more vertical. So, we pick up a capability that's got 400 gig, we're developing 800 gig and then 1.6 T. So, the technical team that come along with that will help us really, really engage in that technical roadmap. What that does is, I think, it's a competitive moat, because people do look for, can I minimize the number of suppliers and who can add more value. For sure, in the AI data centers, photonics is going to becoming more and more critical with power related. So, we see all of that as a positive. And, I think, that we have baked some of the revenues into our guide through 2024 into 2025. But I do think that as we develop the 1.6 T capability, then I think that you'll see that become much, much more material and namely look for other areas of our business. And we -- that's a big play, for example, in automotive, which we haven't talked about, because this is focused on telco and data center. And automotive, there's going to be a play there. And, I mean, I'd like to call out, Matt Crowley is driving that. But KW, who manages that for us out of Asia, is just an industry expert. So, we're feeling -- and the Intel team that are getting better than are selling in real well. So, we're feeling pretty bullish about that in the longer term, Melissa. So, thanks for asking.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Great. Thanks very much. That's it for me, guys.\nKenny Wilson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nMark Delaney: Good morning, and thanks very much for taking my questions. Question on regionalization, and are you still seeing customers looking to have more of their manufacturing done in North America in order to improve supply chain resiliency, or have changes in demand and component lead times meaningfully altered any of those customer plans?\nKenny Wilson: Hey Mark, it's an interesting question. So I think it's nuanced by end market. So for sure in renewables, we're seeing a real push for -- to get the benefit of the incentives into being and North America. That's 100%. In fact, we're active. And a relatively large scale in that discussion where you expect more from us in the next three to six months. So definitely in renewables. Outside of that, I think the pace is relatively consistent. We're still seeing -- I mean I think your point about regionalization. We are still being asked to can we build more EVs for North America and Mexico, can we build them in Europe for the European market and obviously, tariffs, et cetera, and Asia for Asia. So I don't think that's necessarily speed up any or slowed down other than in the renewables space, we're definitely seeing a pickup and ask for us to be localized. So let me also qualify that by saying -- in the cloud space, the secure supply there becomes quite important, and we think that, that's going to be a tailwind for us in the longer term. We talked earlier with Melissa on Photonics, which I think will be a player also -- so I think cloud renewables and the rest of the business is relatively consistent.\nMark Delaney: My other question is on margins and recognizing the outlook the company has for improved margins and also the progress you've made over the last several years. I'm so hoping to better understand as you're seeing lead times for components normalize as you're seeing weaker demand, have you seen any change in your ability to pass through higher cost and negotiate with customers around pricing in light of those changing market conditions?\nKenny Wilson: I mean, I would -- we talk about kind of -- people talk about leverage with customers, and we don't view it that way at all. As I mentioned, we've got a supplier summit right now for surely things are coming down. I mean we pass through -- renegotiate a lot of -- and our customers' behalf, and then we pass that through to our customers and we engage with our suppliers. So -- as we've not seen any pickup in our reduction in margins based on lead times being reduced and our business is -- we write that up and down. And so no, we don't see any real changes there.\nMark Delaney: Thank you and happy holidays.\nKenny Wilson: Thanks, Mark. All the best.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nAdam Berry: Thank you very much for joining our call today. We appreciate your interest in Jabil. Everyone here would like to wish all those a very happy holiday, a peaceful holiday, and we are looking forward to joining the S&P 500 tomorrow. So have a great holiday.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Dastoor",
            "content": "Thanks, Kenny; and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following. First, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for Q2 and FY \u201824, which remains largely consistent with our announcement on November 28, and then I'll provide an update on our accelerated buyback execution plans. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our second quarter guidance. We anticipate the Mobility transaction to close during Q2 of FY \u201824. The exact date of the close will drive where we land. For Q2, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.6 billion. The midpoint of this range assumes the Mobility transaction closes January 31, which is consistent with our modeling assumptions in September. Core operating income for Q2 is estimated to be in the range of $339 million to $399 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $216 million to $301 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.73 to $2.13. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.77 to $1.37. Net interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be $62 million. Before turning to our full-year guidance, it's worth noting that our Q2 guidance is materially influenced by the Mobility transaction close date. I thought it would be helpful if I provide you with the financial impact of an earlier close. For modeling purposes, a December close would reduce the midpoint of our Q2 revenue and core EPS outlook ranges by approximately $400 million and $0.30, respectively. For the year, it would also reduce our revenue outlook by $400 million, while the loss in core EPS would be expected to be offset through accelerated repurchases and lower interest expense, given the earlier receipt of net funds. Now, moving on to full-year guidance on the next slide. As we announced a few weeks ago, towards the end of our quarter, we noticed a widespread slowdown in customer demand. The majority of the slowdown we're seeing is being driven by excess inventory in our customers channel, which we view as short-term in nature. In our view, once the excess channel inventory clears up, we're optimistic that the secular trends across our business remain intact and gives us confidence in future growth. It is important to note that Jabil's net inventory days is in good shape and remains consistent with our target range of 55 days to 60 days. For FY \u201824, we expect revenue to be approximately $31 billion for our modeling assumption of a January 31 close for the Mobility transaction. Importantly, for the year, we continue to expect year-on-year growth across the end markets that are experiencing strong multi-year tailwinds, notably in renewable energy, infrastructure, electric vehicles, AI, cloud data centers and healthcare. Moving to the next slide. Despite the revenue headwinds in the near term, we are confident that we build Jabil to be more resilient as we've diversified across geographies, products, customers and end markets. Because of this, we don't expect the same level of margin erosion traditionally seen in past slowdowns. Our diversified approach, global footprint and strong relationships with customers gives us confidence in weathering these near-term challenges. We're adapting, staying focused on margins and cash flow, and committed to delivering value. Notably for FY \u201824, we still expect core operating margins to be in the range of 5.3% to 5.5%. I would now like to walk you through the dynamics of how we are able to maintain margins despite lower revenue. As a reminder, we have completely changed the construct of our business. We're in the process of divesting one of our highest fixed cost businesses. Additionally, four of our end markets, EVs, healthcare, renewables and cloud, are growing volumes year-on-year, albeit at lower levels than previously anticipated, which means deleveraging is limited as we are able to push our planned investments and costs which have not been incurred yet. In addition to pushing our ramp in investment costs, we're also moving ahead with reducing our SG&A in the back half of the year and optimizing our global footprint. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core operating margins in the 5.3% to 5.5% range in FY \u201824. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchases for the year. In Q1, we executed the previously mentioned $500 million accelerated share repurchase. In September, we originally expected to do a series of accelerated buybacks totaling $1.7 billion in FY \u201824 and $800 million in FY \u201825. We now intend to execute a series of accelerated buybacks of the entire $2.5 billion repurchase authorization in FY \u201824. As a result, I now expect WASO to be in the range of $124 million to $127 million for FY \u201824. We also now expect interest expense to be lower this year in the range of $250 million to $260 million, compared to our expectations in September, as we expect working capital levels to decline with lower revenue. All of these actions gives me confidence that we will offset lower income and deliver core earnings for FY \u201824 to be in excess of $9 per share, and our cash flow outlook for the year remains robust and we are committed to delivering adjusted free cash flow in excess of $1 billion in FY \u201824. In my view, Jabil is well positioned to navigate the current economic environment, evidenced by our performance over the past several years. We are not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets, which are undergoing multi-year secular growth. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Adam. And, Ruplu, If I could just add, and if you look at our revenue, while we've taken revenue down by $2.5 billion, about $1 billion of that is the first half. So, we're not taking the second half as it's absolutely going to recover. We're still being conservative about the second half of the year. There's $1.5 billion coming out. Visibility is a little limited right now, not from our perspective but from our customers' perspective as well. So, we think $1.5 billion to second half is appropriate at this stage. And then if I can, let me just walk you through how we expect EPS to change, because this is a very critical and important piece. If you look at what we provided in September, we said a range of $9.30 to $9.70. If I take a midpoint of $9.50 and start from there, the revenue loss of about bill -- $2.5 billion impacts us by roughly $1.20, and that is sort of the deleveraging. When you're growing year-on-year, especially in the four end markets that we've been focused on, in automotive, healthcare, renewables, cloud, we're growing year-on-year. It's not going down. So, when you grow year-on-year, your deleverage is very limited. You can actually push out a whole bunch of investments and costs and ramps to quarters out from here. So, there's a little bit of nuance here that most people are ignoring in that we are in the right end markets. All of them are still showing growth year-on-year, albeit lower levels, but still year-on-year growth. On some of the lower margin businesses, even if you double the deleveraging there from a 3% or 4% to 8%, you still were losing some level of income, but it's not that much. The margin is not that impacted on the lower margin businesses. And then I talked a little bit about buybacks in my prepared remarks. We completed a $500 million buyback in September. That was huge. That was the biggest buyback we've ever done in a single quarter. And what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we are going to double down on that. So, in September, we'd anticipated doing an additional $1.2 billion in \u201824 and $800 million in \u201825. Now, all of that $2 billion left over is going to be done in FY \u201824. We think this is a good time, it's a good appropriate time to do it when there's a slowdown going in. We still feel we're highly undervalued and buybacks are the best return we can get from our free cash flows, from the proceeds of the funds that we will get once the Mobility divestiture is done. So, it's a bit of a long-winded answer, but you could pick up $0.40, $0.50 quite easily between buyback and lower interest cost as well. Interest will be lower because working capital will be lower because of lower revenue. Plus, after yesterday's news, if interest rates do what the Fed is saying, I think there's a little bit of pickup there as well. So, there's a whole bunch of puts and takes, but we feel pretty strong about the $9 plus. Yes. So, Ruplu, if you look at our Q3 and Q4 run rates, obviously we provided $31 billion as the annual revenue number. We've done Q1 and Q2, so you can extrapolate the second half of the year. If you take those run rates into FY \u201825, some small level of recovery, we're not even thinking of a big recovery coming through, some level of new business which is already in the pipeline, by the way, so we're working on multiple new business wins. And, overall, if you -- even from a smaller base, if you grow by 4%, 5%, 6%, the margin, we're going to be doing 5.4% at least at the midpoint from 5.3% to 5.5% that we said in 2024. It's -- 5.6% in \u201825 is not a stretch. So, margins, we expect that to be higher. If you look at the lower WASO, we'll have not only in FY \u201824 as a result of us doing the entire $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in \u201824, there is an impact in \u201825 as well, because you're getting the entire WASO impact in \u201825. So, overall, I think FY \u201825 is in really good shape. And if I could just add, if you look at EVs, I think, everyone has seen the choppiness, everyone has seen the increased inventories at dealers, et cetera. I think the early adapters have already played out and they've got their EVs. It now becomes a question of cost. All the OEMs, all the EV companies are going to try and get their cost down. Who do you go to when you want to get your cost down? To an EMS company. So, this value proposition that EMS provides from an EV manufacturing perspective, we're well positioned for EVs, we're well positioned for hybrids. If you look at the battery management systems, the compute modules, the optics, all of that, we're in a good space to actually provide some value to OEMs who have to now take their costs down a bit, because that's the second wave of EV will be cost based, not the early adoption wave that we just rode a few quarters ago. So, obviously, part of free cash flow is income, Steve. And when you lose $2.5 billion, you do lose income. Even though your margin is maintained, the dollars do come out. So, there is an offset. You're absolutely right on the working capital. Working capital does go down, and that is sort of baked in, but you also lose the income. The other area that we're looking at is CapEx very carefully. We've always been disciplined. In these times, we're even more disciplined and if we're pushing out investments, we're pushing out some level of CapEx that would help free cash flow as well. And it's early days, Steve. That's why we've stuck with the $1 billion plus. But do I expect it to be higher than that? Yes. So, let me just answer that in a slightly different way than you've asked it. I expected, and I've always expected inventory days to be in the 55 to 60-day range. When inventory goes up, the inventory deposits go up in sync. When inventory days start coming down or normalizing, yes, there is a level of return on the inventory deposits. So, a quick answer to your question is, are we going to see a pop in free cash flow because inventories are going to go down? The answer is no. It's not a pop in free cash flow. It will still be in the 55 to 60 days. It's just a matter of the gross number going down and the inventory deposits going down in sync. So, that's something we're good at managing. That's something we have really good relationships with customers, and we're always working on that particular front. So, no, free cash flow won't get a pop. It's already baked into our numbers at that 55, 60, and that's where it will stay. No. So, I think the way to think of this is the revenue comes out, the cost comes out. When the revenue comes back, as we expect it to be sometime in FY \u201825, those costs will come back, but there will be an offset. So, net-net, the impact on margin will be neutral. I think, we've said 5.3% to 5.5%. I think, we've got to remember we've changed the construct of our business completely. The four end markets do not underestimate that those continue to grow. It's not by chance that we happen to be in those four end markets. Over the last few years, we've intentionally focused on those end markets, because we always thought those were the long-term secular end markets. I think, overall, the way to think about cost push outs, it's completely dependent on whether that revenue is there. If the revenue suddenly comes back, those costs will come back. So, I'm not saying a 5.3% to 5.5% will suddenly jump up if those revenues come back. We have other plans on making margin continue to go up as we continue to change the mix, as we continue to add new operational efficiencies, the automation side, AI/ML, robotics, all of that will continue to provide on an annualized basis, in my view, at least 10 to 20 basis points by itself. And the mix of the business, the revenue piece will provide the balance. So, yes, I think the push outs is completely revenue driven. I think, there's multiple ways of looking at the AI piece. AI and the new GPUs that drive our requirements, that drive space requirements, it's going to exponentially continue to sort of grow on an annual basis. The margin stack on what we do today will be relatively stable. It's the new services that we provide, the new value-add that we'll be looking at in terms of liquid cooling, photonics, those are the pieces that we think will be highly margin accretive. I'm not suggesting that will happen immediately, but over time I do expect the AI cloud data centers the margin to go up, that entire stack to be more value-add based. And, David, from a buyback perspective, you're absolutely right. We're going to try and get the whole $2.5 billion done this year. That not only has a positive impact on WASO in FY \u201824, I think we've said 124 million to 127 million WASO by the end of \u201824. And then for FY \u201825, we'll have a normalized buyback program. And if you look back at our history over the last six, seven, eight, 10 years, we've done about $500 million a year. So, it will be safe again. We don't have the authorization from the Board yet for that FY \u201825. It's early days. But I'd expect that to be in that $500 million range. And when you add all the early buybacks in \u201824 plus that our WASO goes down to $110 million to $115 million depending on share price, so it is the best use of our funds. And I keep saying that with our history, what we've done over the last few years proves that out, that we've been -- we put our money where our mouth is, and we will continue to do so as we feel we're still highly undervalued. I would also expect some level of enterprise level spend to improve. I think, a lot of CFOs have been pulling back on purchases, enterprise level purchases, with interest rates going down. And just the whole macro environment changes on that perspective. So, we do expect other end markets to have an impact. Will it happen immediately? Probably not, but over time it will have a positive impact for us and for almost every other company as well."

            "content": "Thanks, Adam; and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, on November 28, we announced a reduction in our outlook for fiscal year 2024 based on a broad slowdown of demand across multiple end markets. In short, customers adjusted demand schedules as they reacted to a slowdown in end markets heading into the end of the calendar year. Although we feel the slowdown will be temporary in nature, it is incumbent on us to react and adjust our model appropriately to align with our customers' requirements. Agility in our industry is key. Being able to absorb changes in demand signals effectively across our network is a critical part of our value proposition. This agility is part of our DNA and is reflected in our ability to effectively absorb downsides and revenue. Fungible assets, flexible automation, single instance of SAP, common manufacturing execution systems, focus on margin rich value-added services, and multi customer sites set up specifically to manage disparate end markets in one campus are just some examples of disciplines embedded in our model. These core areas of focus are a large part of why we believe we can manage margins consistent with our Q1 guide and EPS at $9 plus, while absorbing a broad-based slowdown. Turning to end markets, where you take a deeper look, we still expect growth in key areas like electric vehicles and renewables, albeit at a modestly slower pace than previously anticipated. In healthcare, our business remains robust and foundational in terms of what we are trying to accomplish at Jabil. Our ability to provide key solutions and capabilities to customers in complex areas where outsourcing is underpenetrated and quality is paramount underpins our confidence that we will continue to grow in this end market. And in cloud, our team continued to drive forward within the AI data center space. Remember, this business moved into a consignment model last year, which makes revenue look unusually low, relative to previous years, while in reality the business is growing volumes by roughly 20%. In connected devices, we've seen softening for some time, and this doesn't seem likely to change in the near-term. While in enterprise, communications and 5G, we continue to expect softness based on global rollouts. Turning to renewables, we've seen softness in solar and wind, driven by a combination of reduced channel inventory sell through, impact of interest rates and incentive uncertainty. Outlook wise, we remain optimistic based on multiple new business wins and some supply chain consolidation within our current customer base. On the sale of our mobility business, I am really pleased with the progress we are making. The selfless collaboration between our teams while working on closing the deal, ensuring the needs of our customer remain top of mind has been really pleasing to see. Focusing on your day job, keeping product flowing, while managing a complex transition is hard. The fact that we are managing this so successfully is another proof point of our belief that BYD Electronics is the correct partner for this transaction. Taken altogether, we now expect revenue not associated with the mobility divestiture to be down 5% year-over-year on a like-for-like basis. Reflecting on all of the above, it's pretty satisfying to see the resilience of our model where despite end market choppiness, we expect to post year-on-year growth in core margins and EPS, while also driving in excess of $1 billion in free cash flows. Further, we remain committed to our previous fiscal year \u201825 guidance, inclusive of margins at 5.6% plus and EPS in excess of $10.65. In closing, I want to share a final thought. In Jabil, we are always planning our future. And as sad as I am to say goodbye to my colleagues as they transition to BYD Electronics, I would like to welcome the procurement services team from procureability and the silicon photonics technical team from Intel as they join our company. Welcome, and we look forward to your contribution as we focus on the next chapter of our company's growth and diversification. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I will now hand the call to Mike. Hey, thanks, Ruplu. So, first of all, let me take the last part of your question there, which is, I think, our model is relatively consistent that we don't take inventory risk. So, everything that we buy is underwritten by a forecast or a purchase order. So, we're pretty comfortable in that. And if you look at where we are in Q1, with the slowdown at 58 days, that's still industry leading. And so, we're pretty confident there. If you look at the way where our company is set up, we run divisions, we've got division leads, and we've then got a leadership team that support that. So, we're pretty intimate with our customers. And all of our team have been very, very active with our customer base. You're looking at what happened in Q1, what's happening for the balance of the year. And the feedback, although nuanced with different impacts in different end markets. And what we see is relatively consistent. And, incidentally, myself, I mean, I've been in Europe and in Asia over the last month meeting a lot of our customers also. So, the feedback is -- and remember, we get forecast, 12-months' forecast pretty much for all of our customers. And we see their feeds, we look at what they're pooling and what they're selling. So, the feedback generally is, look, we expect the next couple of quarters to be inventory correction and we think beyond that we're in decent shape, and we've baked that into what we see for the back half of the year. The other thing I'd like to emphasize is that, in the discussions we're having, and times like this ultimately can be good for us from a consolidation perspective. So, we're pretty active in a number of discussions with our customers about how can we make their business easier by helping them consolidate supply chains, so that their business is simpler to manage. So -- I mean, I would say that we're really close with our customers. The data we get is pretty consistent. And we're monitoring really closely. I mean, we'd like for the inventory to be sold through, but it's not -- and when we think it will be over the next couple of quarters. And -- but we'll bake that into our guide for Q2 for the balance of the year. Thanks, Ruplu. Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, I would say, I mean, if we -- if I run through our end markets, just to give you some color, so 5G is obviously soft, and you see that from the customers that we serve. A slowdown in end markets there and our network and switching business, we see the kind of campus and enterprise space, softer with an inventory glut, but we're really going great guns and accelerated switching around the AI space. So, that's been pretty positive for us. In healthcare, ortho is down, but pharma and med devices are up. And then in auto, which I think is a part -- in terms of your question about new products, we see the new products getting pushed out there to some degree. What I would always say is that or what we've always said is that, look, we think our auto business is going to be up into the right, but it's not going to be linear, it's going to be lumpy. And we see that. And if you look at the auto market, where people are saying that the expectation is that it's going to grow 20%, 30%, but you look at the inventory in the lots right now. So, we see some push out in automotive. Although to Mike's earlier point, we're still growing pretty nicely there. And then, on renewables, so we look at, kind of, residential slowing down with interest rates, effectively commercial still going reasonably okay. We see a kind of slowdown in energy storage as people wait for the IRA to really get bedded in. But we think the backlog here is going to recover relatively quickly thereafter. So, I think -- I mean, that's some of the key end markets I mentioned in cloud, where AI is really driving our cloud business. We're operating in a new facility to support that. So, we're up there. And so, generally, renewables is a little bit softer with some new product being delayed. We do see consolidation in the renewable space, which I think is going to help us for sure as the industry recovers there. And then -- and automotive is just a push out of some orders, but -- so hopefully that answers your question. Thanks, Steve. Yes. I mean, I think, there's a little bit of when people report the results and -- but from our perspective, we've seen that late in our quarter, wherein some of the end markets are nuanced to some degree as of the customers, but generally we've seen it broad-based across our customers. And we also see that a lot of our customers report calendar quarters, and it was really the back end of their announcements where they took actions to reduce our outlook. So, I mean, I would push back quite strongly that our visibility into our customer base is disconnected and that we don't do a good a job of that as our competitors, to be honest. I think, it's just time and based on -- we got that feedback in -- toward the back end of our quarter. So, that would be my answer. You're welcome. Yes. So, let me take the EV one first. And we've always -- I mean, we've grown 40% and we've said that that would slow down this year. I mean, we are still bullish on the EV space in the longer term. And remember that although that the demand moves up and down and we look at this in the longer term, five, six, seven, 10-years. And so, from our perspective -- and then what we do is, we look at where is the demand patterns? And we've got a global footprint. We do things consistently across the globe. So, the fact that there's growth in Asia and it slows down in other markets means that we've got a footprint in each of those regions. We've -- the customer base that we have is really positive, is really -- we've got a really good customer base focused in North America, Europe and in Asia. So, we're able to adapt to changes in demand cycles. And if you look right now in China, where the demand is picking up, we build EVs in China, we've got multiple customers here. So, we think the long-term trend is good there. We think we're in the right areas. We think we're in the right markets, and we think we've got the right capabilities. So, we think it's going to be up and to the right. Is it going to be 20%, 30%, 40%? We think we can adapt it to any of those numbers. So, we're pretty confident in the long-term of our EV strategy. So, in terms of other markets, we're still growing. I think, we said in prepared remarks that our auto business is going to grow at 11%, healthcare and packaging 6%. So, as Mike mentioned, the areas of our business that we're really focused on growing with secular tailwinds, we think are -- still continue to grow. Renewables at 7%. So, yes, we think that we're in a good spot across all of those end markets. Yes. Hey, George, thanks for the question. So, we always talk about connected devices as effectively what we do for consumer. We view that as being an area where we can incubate capabilities that can support us across the rest of our business. What we do find is that we got to be quite selective there, because, A, it's consumer short life cycles you're dependent sometimes and if products are successful or not. Sometimes there's an expectation in margins that the margins will be pretty tight for us. So, it's not a case of us defocusing in that side of our business, but it's a case of us being selective in terms of the margin profile for some specific programs. So, I think, you'll see, and you should see it across our network. And I think to the previous question on margins. Look, we [Technical Difficulty] and that support our capabilities and that support our cash flows and margins. So, I think, in this instance, it's a case of -- it's really maybe one or two other areas of our business where we're just choosing not to engage, because we think that we can add more value for our customers with the capabilities in different end markets. Hey, David, thank you. So, on inventory correction, David, as I mentioned, that subsequent to meeting you in Phoenix, our folks have been out meeting our customers, as I have. I would say that the sentiment certainly hasn't got worse, and, if anything, marginally better, but it's still in some areas a quarter, and a lot of areas a couple of quarters. So, it's relatively consistent with what we discussed in Phoenix. So, no change to the negative, maybe just slightly more positive. But just to reemphasize that, the discussions we're having -- what we see is, we are seeing opportunities to -- our customers are looking to consolidate their supply chains with fewer suppliers and that's positive for us -- long-term positive for us. Renewables for sure. Yes. Renewables for sure. I mean, if we look at our -- we've developed a -- developing really great capabilities in the renewable space and we're kind of just waiting for things to bed down and guidance from -- through with the IRA. But also interest rates for sure are impacting solar rollouts in the residential space. So, I would say, out of all of our businesses -- auto will help us also, obviously, and -- but I think renewables would be the number one. We would expect to see a tailwind there. Yes. Hey, Melissa. So, I would disconnect the two a little bit. So, what -- there's been some announcements from us on supply chain services. We just had our supplier summit actually yesterday and today, which has been fabulous to meet with our suppliers. We've been talking supply chain services for a long time and we're just putting the building blocks in place to make that material for us in the longer term, but obviously to support our customers. In terms of supply chain consolidation, what we're finding is that, and it goes back to, I think, pre-COVID, where the world thought that supply chain diversification was good. So, have multiple suppliers be dual sourced. And then people found out that that was hugely difficult to manage. So, when you get dislocations like this, our customers are thinking, how can I simplify my life? How can I simplify my world? I mean, people look at our inventory relative to our peers and they're saying, well, maybe that's an indicator of that I should be safe with Jabil. And what we see is just discussions around, look, can you -- can we -- can you manage my supply chain? Can you build it in your sites? It gives me less people to engage with as long as you can trust it and you can deliver. So, it really is that and dislocation that's driving those discussions and that's happened. If I look at other times like this, that -- what we've found has been good for our business if you look at the pre to post-COVID. So, we do expect that this will be good for us also in the longer term. Yes. So, for sure, let me talk about the -- let me just give you a little bit of background on that and then talk about what we're doing. We did an acquisition in 2014 of optical business, a small optical business with a tuck-in capability like we do. And we've been gradually building that. And the key for us was it was in the telco space, but it was always going to be focused on the datacom space in the longer term, that's where we've seen the value. So, we've been growing that capability. It's not hugely material for us, but the capability is something that we think we can develop. So, this Intel opportunity is, it really came out of a discussion with our cloud providers where they're looking for us to -- they're looking to disaggregate supply chains and want us to be more vertical. So, we pick up a capability that's got 400 gig, we're developing 800 gig and then 1.6 T. So, the technical team that come along with that will help us really, really engage in that technical roadmap. What that does is, I think, it's a competitive moat, because people do look for, can I minimize the number of suppliers and who can add more value. For sure, in the AI data centers, photonics is going to becoming more and more critical with power related. So, we see all of that as a positive. And, I think, that we have baked some of the revenues into our guide through 2024 into 2025. But I do think that as we develop the 1.6 T capability, then I think that you'll see that become much, much more material and namely look for other areas of our business. And we -- that's a big play, for example, in automotive, which we haven't talked about, because this is focused on telco and data center. And automotive, there's going to be a play there. And, I mean, I'd like to call out, Matt Crowley is driving that. But KW, who manages that for us out of Asia, is just an industry expert. So, we're feeling -- and the Intel team that are getting better than are selling in real well. So, we're feeling pretty bullish about that in the longer term, Melissa. So, thanks for asking. Thank you. Hey Mark, it's an interesting question. So I think it's nuanced by end market. So for sure in renewables, we're seeing a real push for -- to get the benefit of the incentives into being and North America. That's 100%. In fact, we're active. And a relatively large scale in that discussion where you expect more from us in the next three to six months. So definitely in renewables. Outside of that, I think the pace is relatively consistent. We're still seeing -- I mean I think your point about regionalization. We are still being asked to can we build more EVs for North America and Mexico, can we build them in Europe for the European market and obviously, tariffs, et cetera, and Asia for Asia. So I don't think that's necessarily speed up any or slowed down other than in the renewables space, we're definitely seeing a pickup and ask for us to be localized. So let me also qualify that by saying -- in the cloud space, the secure supply there becomes quite important, and we think that, that's going to be a tailwind for us in the longer term. We talked earlier with Melissa on Photonics, which I think will be a player also -- so I think cloud renewables and the rest of the business is relatively consistent. I mean, I would -- we talk about kind of -- people talk about leverage with customers, and we don't view it that way at all. As I mentioned, we've got a supplier summit right now for surely things are coming down. I mean we pass through -- renegotiate a lot of -- and our customers' behalf, and then we pass that through to our customers and we engage with our suppliers. So -- as we've not seen any pickup in our reduction in margins based on lead times being reduced and our business is -- we write that up and down. And so no, we don't see any real changes there. Thanks, Mark. All the best."
