At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.\nMollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we are excited to report strong Q4 results with revenue of $15.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.90. Our enterprise comparable sales growth for the quarter was 3.2% above the high end of our guidance range and on top of 3% last year. We are posting our 12th straight quarter of comparable sales growth and showing our strength as a successful multi-channel retailer who can meet customers when and where they want. We offered compelling holiday deals that resonated with customers and provided a seamless shopping experience, great inventory availability and fast free delivery. Across online home and stores, we are fulfilling our purpose to help enrich people's lives with technology, while also helping technology companies commercialize their products innovation. Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 3.4%. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, partially offset by gains. We also saw continued growth from our transformative initiatives, like total tech support and in-home consultation. The enterprise Q4 non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.5% was better than we expected due to lower SG&A expense. On the gross profit rate line, the mix of products we sold in the quarter drove a lower rate than we anticipated. For the full year, we grew enterprise comparable sales to 2.1%, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate 30 basis points and increased our non-GAAP earnings per share of 14% to $6. 07. We also returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we are proud of these results and I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work, commitment to serving customers, and amazing execution as we navigated ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment and the challenging tariff situation. Against that backdrop, our associates also continue to drive significant progress against our building the New Blue strategy. We believe our strategy will uniquely position us over the long term by leveraging our combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. Let me provide some highlights of our progress, starting with how we are better serving our existing customers. We continue to innovate and design digital experiences that solve customer needs across online and physical shopping. This includes enhancing our digital shopping platform with new functionality and evolving our marketing strategy to drive engagement with our customers with a particular focus on our app. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and usage grew significantly through the year. In fiscal \u201820 customer visits to the app were up 22% overall and usage of our app within our stores was up approximately 17%. Customers on the Best Buy app engage with us eight times more frequently than those who solely use our website or mobile site. At the same time, we continue to transform our supply chain using automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve the delivery and installation experience. We also continue to improve the buy online, pickup in-store experience for our customers, including the introduction of curbside pickup and alternate pickup locations. As a result of all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation, in Q4 we promised free next day delivery on thousands of items, all season long to 99% of our customers, with no membership or minimum purchase required. And we also promised online customers who wanted to pick up in store that their items would be ready within one hour of placing an order. As a result store pickup was up over 500 basis points to 42% of online sales in Q4. All of these improvements were made with our customer experiences in mind and they contributed to continued online growth for the year. We saw particularly strong results in the fourth quarter where online sales grew 18.7% and represented 25% of our total domestic revenue. For the year, online sales represented almost 20% of our domestic revenue. We also focused on enhancing the in-home experience for our customers. During fiscal \u201920, we expanded our in-home consultation program from 530 to 725 advisors. This combined with tools to maximize their productivity helped us decrease the amount of time customers were waiting for an advisor appointment. A key driver of NPS and close rates and allowed us to provide more than 250,000 free in-home consultations to customers across the nation. Both employees and customers continued to love it. The Net Promoter Score for purchasers is high at 87 and the advisor employee turnover remains low. Additionally, we are now seeing a growing percentage of repeat purchases, as customers develop and take advantage of their relationship with their advisors. This of course was the intent when we began the program and we're delighted to see these relationships being built as we continue to increase investment in technology that is perfectly suited for this new kind of seamless customer interaction. Providing 24 by 7 support for all their technology needs is another way we build relationships with our customers. Our total Tech Support Program grew steadily during fiscal \u201820 to end the year with almost 2.3 million members. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice of likely to use other services than non-members. The average member uses the program approximately 2.5 times per year. During the year we also rolled out pilots to test new member requested benefits related to networking, parental controls and data storage. We also made progress on our initiatives to capture new demand and enter new spaces. In fiscal \u201920, we became the nation's largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repaired, almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven't made a purchase in the last year. Turning to Best Buy Health, during fiscal \u201920, we continue to advance our initiatives designed to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. We successfully integrated two additional acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We are encouraged by the integration with Best Buy and the conversations we are having with potential partners. Of course, our success with customers and the progress we are making on our building the New Blue strategy is driven by the enthusiasm, talent and purposeful leadership of our employee. During fiscal \u201920, we continue to invest in wages, training and many new employee benefits, including paid time off for part time employees, paid caregiver leaves, expanded mental health benefits, enhanced adoption assistance and a new surrogacy assistance benefit. Our employee engagement is high and our turnover rates in our stores remain in the low 30% range compared to 50% five years ago. Additionally, our average store general manager has been in his or her store for about six years, which is incredibly important from a store leadership and community perspective. In parallel to the customer experience work, during fiscal \u201820 we continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressure. In the middle of the year, we completed the existing $600 million cost reduction target that we expect in fiscal \u201818. In September we announced our new target of an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiency by the end of fiscal \u201925. We achieved approximately $160 million toward our new goal in the back half of the year. We are also proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts. In fact, we were just named the top five on Barron's Annual 100 most sustainable companies list for the third consecutive year. You can find more information about our efforts in our annual corporate responsibility and sustainability report which can be found at investors.bestbuy.com. Similarly, would like to note our progress related to our teen tech centers, a program we are very proud of and passionate about. These centers are after school learning spaces, equipped with cutting-edge technology where teens learn new tech skills, gain exposure to new career possibilities and benefit from positive adult and peer relationships. We have that at 11 teen centers in the past year for a total of 33 locations across the country. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in this program, with plans to open 11 new centers this year. And we know this work is making a difference, 91% of teens say they are more optimistic about their futures because of their time at the teen tech centers and 73% say they are interested or very interested in studying some aspect of stem in the future. I'm also incredibly proud to report that Best Buy was once again the top partner for the St. Jude. Thanks and Giving campaign, helping raise a record $22 million through customer and employee donations in our stores and online this holiday season. That pushes our cumulative total to more than $100 million raised for the kids of St. Jude since we first partnered in 2013. As we enter fiscal \u201921, we are excited about our opportunities and are encouraged by our momentum. As a reminder, back in September, we set three fiscal 25 targets focused on employees, customers and financial. First to be one of the best companies to work for in the US, exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Second, double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support membership, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services and senior life supporting. And third, deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal \u201825. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities, while maintaining profitability over time. I would like to highlight some focus areas for this year. First, in service of our existing customer, we will continue to bring our deep CE expertise and unique ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. In this context, we are excited by the opportunities related to technology innovation over the next several years. As we have discussed previously, these are technologies like 8K, OLED, dual screen notebook computers, multiple phones, consumer health products, connected fitness, new gaming consoles, and new products that leveraged 5G capability. We will also launch new categories where we can leverage our digital first mindset, supported by our expertise around curation and supply chain. Some of these will be online only and include areas such as hearing aids, sustainable living products, expanded connected fitness initiative and travel and luggage. These are categories that we believe our customers would expect to find at Best Buy. From a digital standpoint, we will continue to drive engagement with customers during their shopping and ownership journey, while making it a seamless as possible for customers as they interact with us across channels. For example in the app we will make it much easier for customers to discover and benefit from the support services we offer, including scheduling appointments, which is something that currently requires a separate app download. We also plan to utilize location data to make it even easier and more intuitive for customers in the app to see both products availability and the expanding options for fulfillment. From an in-home standpoint, we will continue to enhance the experience for customers, while at the same time testing new opportunities for growth and becoming more efficient in the way we are serving customers in their home. As I mentioned earlier, we now have over 720 in-home advisors and we continue to receive great customer feedback. In fiscal \u201921, we are testing new tiered advisor roles that will match the right employee with the right customer need. We are also continuing to enhance our clienteling technology platform to drive better customer experiences. For example, the platform can increasingly help our advisors use knowledge about their client's current and future need to proactively communicate new promotions and product launches over time that can help meet those customers. In addition to our in-home advisors, we also have approximately 900 Magnolia System Designers, all of whom are supported by nearly 6000 Geek Squad agents, core train and premium home theater and custom installation. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to build upon all of these great resources collectively to enhance the customer experience. Our stores remain incredibly important and must work in tandem with our digital and in-home experiences. In fiscal \u201821, we will continue to enhance both the proficiency of our store associates and optimize the way they work in order to drive stronger customer relationships. We are also investing in technology, including the rollout of electronic shelf labels to all of our stores, to enhance the customer experience and generate cost savings through added efficiency. Additionally, we will test and learn from a small number of new store and remodel pilot with a focus on fulfillment and differentiated shopping experiences for our customers. We will continue to develop and hone our local market focus by leveraging the strategic changes we made last year to our field operation. Designed to create a more seamless experience across channels, these changes put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their markets. These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights data and analytics to view a markets largest opportunity and fast track initiative to accelerate growth. In total tech support, our focus will be on driving new memberships and ensuring our members continue to see the offering and something they can't live without. We know that our members tend to use the offering more in the initial months after becoming a member and our goal is to continue to see the usage increase over time across their membership. As we shared at our Investor update last September, we see an opportunity over time to evolve our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We plan to roll out pilots during the year as we work on the best way to simplify offering and move from managing the economics offer by offer which is how we look at it today to a more holistic and streamlined offering that is centered on the customer. Turning to our focus on capturing new demand and entering new spaces, in fiscal \u201821 we plan to expand our lease to own purchase option, by building awareness throughout the year and then adding an option for customers to use lease to own for online transactions in the third quarter. Now I would like to talk about Best Buy Health. As we shared before most of the seniors we currently serve are utilizing easy to use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. For example with our health and safety services, customers can talk to US based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. As we enter fiscal \u201921, there are a number of developments that we believe will accelerate the growth of this direct to consumer business. First, we are launching a number of new products and services, including a new mobile medical alert device, also called PERS, a wearable device, an app designed for both seniors and their caregivers. Second, we are enhancing the customer experience in our Best Buy stores. This includes expanded shelf space and merchandising presentation, as well as the ability for sales associates to help customers activate their devices at the time of purchase, so they can start using the services right away. Third, we have a new distribution agreement with Walgreens to carry our new PERS, device in 6600 Walgreens stores across the country and walgreens.com. Fourth, we signed a new AARP agreement, whereby the organization's 38 million members will get exclusive discounts on our health and safety devices. At the same time we will continue to focus on the commercial health opportunities, where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by health plans, health System and others in the senior care industry. There is a high level of interest in our unique combination of tech and touch and the potential we have to reduce health care costs and bring greater peace of mind for seniors and their families and caregivers. As we expected when we entered the state, the health care industry has long sales cycles and this side of the business will take longer to ramp than the direct to consumer side. Turning to supply chain, we will focus on leveraging automation across the supply chain network and offering customers free next day delivery, which we view as table stakes across the industry. We will also continue to roll out enhancements to buy online, pickup in store to make it even more convenient for our customers to get their products, including alternate pickup locations, as well as curbside pickup at Best Buy store. We have just expanded alternate pickup to approximately 2000 locations across 9 markets and plan to expand to more markets throughout fiscal \u201821. These alternate pickup locations are in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship to home option is not desired. Last quarter we also introduced curbside pickup at approximately 100 stores, which allows customers to pick up their tech without even getting out of their car. Customers are finding value in this option as curbside already accounts for 15% of store pickup units at those locations and we plan to expand this service to the majority of our stores in fiscal \u201921. Of course to bring all of the initiatives we have just discussed to light, we will need to invest in technology. It is imperative to the success of our strategy that we continue to improve our clienteling and CRM program, enhance our data and analytics capabilities and drive artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation. Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to note that we are closely monitoring the developments related to the coronavirus and our thoughts are with all of those who have been affected. We remain focused on supporting our people and vendor partners during this time. As you all know this is a very fluid situation that is changing daily and that it is very difficult to determine exact financial impact. Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimate at this time. Based on what we know today, we have assumed the majority of the impacts occur in the first half of the year. Therefore we view this as a relatively short term disruption that does not impact our long term strategy and initiative. For the year, we expect comp growth of flat to up 2% and a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.8%. This guide reflects our continued investment in those areas necessary to make strategic progress and deliver enhanced employee and customer experiences, as well as our continued focus on driving cost savings and efficiency. We remain confident that our fiscal \u201821 plan moves us along the path to achieve our fiscal \u201825 targets, specifically the financial targets of $50 billion in revenue at a 5% operating income rate. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter and full year and our amazing team are motivated and ready to deliver on our fiscal \u201821 initiatives. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting work underway and ahead of us. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter results and our guidance.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $15.2 we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $2.90 both of which exceeded our expectations. We had better than expected revenue results both online and within our International business. From a category perspective, we saw stronger than expected performance from computing and headphones, whereas gaming and smart home were a bit softer compared to our previous estimates. As Corie mentioned, our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was driven by lower SG&A, which was primarily the result of lower than expected incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. This was partially offset by a lower than expected gross profit rate. I will share additional details on the gross profit rate drivers later in my prepared remarks. The favourability - the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a net $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate that was partially offset by a higher share count. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 2.7% to $15.2 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 3.2%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.18 or 7% to $2.90. This increase was driven by a $0.12 per share benefit from the net share count change and a $0.06 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 2.6% to $13.85 billion. The comparable sales increase of 3.4% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets.  These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming category. In addition, comparable sales in the services category were essentially flat to last year. As we shared previously, the slower growth, as compared to previous quarters is primarily due to lapping the refinement of revenue recognition for our total tech support offer we made in Q4 of last year. Within the quarter, growth from total tech support revenue was largely offset by a decline in warranty revenue. Looking forward, we expect comparable sales growth in the services category to be in the mid single digit range next quarter. Domestic online revenue of $3.5 million was 25.4% of domestic revenue, up from 21.9% percent last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 18.7% over the fourth quarter of last year. The growth was primarily driven by higher average order values, but also benefited from increased traffic and improved conversion rates. In our International segment, revenue increased 3.4% to $1.35 billion, primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.6% and approximately 150 [ph] basis points of positive foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate was 21.2% versus 22.1% last year. The 90 basis point decrease was primarily driven by items we shared on last quarter's call, these included one, an unfavorable sales mix of products, two, rate pressure in our services category and three, impacts associated with tariffs on goods imported from China, which was largely aligned with our expectations heading into the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced more pressure from product mix than we previously expected due to heavier mix in certain vendor products. International gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 22.6%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $48 million compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, which was partially offset by a number of items, including variable expenses associated with higher revenue and higher advertising. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A decreased approximately 70 basis points to 14.7%. I would like to say a few words on incentive compensation expense, which has been a driver of lowest SG&A expense compared to last year throughout fiscal \u201920. Most of the variability over the course of the year has been due to last year's results, significantly exceeding our incentive performance targets. Compared to our original expectations at the start of the year, lower than planned incentive compensation had an approximately 10 basis point favorable impact to our full year fiscal \u201820 operating income rate, but nearly all of the impact occurring in fourth quarter. International SG&A of $215 billion increased $8 million and was flat to last year as a percentage of revenue. The $8 million increase was primarily driven by expense associated with new store locations in Mexico and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. As Corie said, during fiscal \u201820 we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders though $1 billion in share repurchases, $527 million in dividends. This morning we announced that we increased our quarterly dividend 10% to $0.55 per share and provided an outlook for share repurchases of $750 million to $1 billion in fiscal \u201821 I would now like to talk about our outlook. Our full year fiscal \u201821 financial guidance is the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $43.3 billion to $44.3 billion. Enterprise comparable sales of flat to 2%, enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.8%, enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.10 to $6.30 and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23%. I would like to call it a number of assumptions. We expect to continue to operate in a positive consumer environment in 2020. As Corie mentioned earlier, our revenue guidance also includes our best estimate of the impacts from supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. We expect our gross profit rate to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of revenue is expected to be slightly up to fiscal \u201920. As it relates to capital expenditures, we plan to spend in the range of $800 million to $900 million, as we continue to build the capabilities needed to execute our strategy. The increase in capital expenditures will include some of the areas Corie noted previously, such as deploying electronic sign labels and continued investments in technology, health and supply chain. As it relates to the first quarter, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of flat to 1%, non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.05 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 22.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 260 million shares. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.\nPeter Keith: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask on the full year guidance, so it looks like at the midpoint you're guiding to about 2% earnings growth which is a little bit below last year's initial range and also below kind of the long term CAGR to 2025 of about 4% percent before buyback. So I would assume there's some coronavirus impact to the numbers, but could you just kind of frame up why the overall earnings growth is a little bit below maybe normalized run rate?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. This is Matt. I'll start with that. First, as [Technical Difficulty] remarks, believe we're operating in a very positive consumer environment similar to last year, all the data points indicate a good consumer unemployment is good, wage growth is good, consumer spending is good and wage forecast. That being said, separately there is some supply chain related issues as a result of the coronavirus. So on the low end of our guide we would assume that there is a material disruption - supply chain disruption from that, and we \u2013 and that we can't make it all up in the year. So that's one reason, as we said we did factor in the coronavirus outbreak into the overall guidance and the range. We're still very positive about of number of initiatives that we have, such as IHA and TTS growth. There are certain categories that we still expect to perform strongly next year, such as appliances and headphones. Like I said total tech support is still an area of growth for us next year. Gaming would be an area where we are expecting it to be down on a year-over-year basis as well. We do expect to see new console launches in holiday period next year, but the first three quarters will be down or we expect to be down. And then we still have moderate assumptions for TV and mobile phones to the extent that there is better adoption, some of those new technologies like 5G and 8K then that could help move us up towards that range. So to your earlier point, yes we did try to factor in the coronavirus outbreak into the overall year end and that did have some impact to the overall guidance.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Thanks. And maybe quick follow on, is there way to think about the impact of coronavirus on first half of the year, maybe from a comp sales perspective, understanding that and it might be wrong, but would be helpful and how much is factored in at this point?\nCorie Barry: So - Peter this is Corie. I think trying to size perfectly the coronavirus impact at this point is incredibly difficult. I think you as much as anyone would respect it, it's incredibly fluid situation. We are trying to for Q1 and the full year estimate as best we can the impact, mainly in the form of lower sales volume, as you could imagine and we literally so far have gone vendor-by-vendor to analyze the size of the impact. But it is complicated and very difficult to size. And we're trying to weigh things like which factories are back up and running and they're all at varying capacities across Asia. Even if the product isn't final produced in Asia, some people are waiting for components that may flow from there. There are varying levels of safety stock across the industry and global vendors have varying levels of global inventory and then obviously estimating the transportation situation once the production comes back it is also difficult. And so based on what we know today, we're assuming the majority of the impact is in the first half and we do view it as a relatively short term disruption that doesn't impact our longer term strategy. But obviously right now we are isolating our approach to the supply chain impacts. And as Matt said, we're assuming the consumer continues on a relatively good pace. So there's still a lot for us to learn there, which means sizing it perfectly just doesn't seem appropriate at this point.\nPeter Keith: Okay, fair enough. That's helpful. And thank you very much.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Josh on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. The complexion of your margin guidance is a little bit different from the recent past. What are you doing to stabilize gross margins when some of the headwinds like tariffs appear to be rising and their internal or external factors responsible for the reversal on SG&A leverage that you've seen over the past few years?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure, as it relates to gross profit in Q4 I think the implied guidance going into the quarter - excuse me, assumed about 60 to 70 basis points of pressure. What we saw in the quarter largely played out with what we expected in the same areas. As a reminder what we said was one of the buckets was unfavorable sales mix of products and vendor mix was part of that. Services pressure was another aspect to the pressure we saw going into the quarter. And then as well we factored in tariffs on imported goods from China, largely those all still played out. What we did see was a little bit more pressure on the sales and vendor mix than we expected. During the quarter, we made a point to meet the market in a few key categories, we weren't leading the market from a promotional perspective. In those categories, the customer demand was very high, even higher than we probably even expected going into it and the mix so that had a negative impact on margins. So we don't believe that we wouldn't characterize it as irrational or overly promotional, more or more or less just meeting the customer demand in a very thoughtful way. And if you step back and look at the entire year, the full year gross profit was down 20 basis points. Q4 was of - most of that decreased. And as we said next year we're expecting gross margin rates to be flat. So we do believe that pressure will start to stabilize next year. Now we're not going to guide every quarter and we don't expect it all be the same. But from a full year perspective we do expect some of that to stabilize through the next year.\nUnidentified Analyst: And, sorry\u2026\nCorie Barry: I think some of our - I'm sorry, go forward in nature for next year and the reason we think they stabilized a bit more, there's a couple of things. One, while tariffs had some impact on Q4 for the next year we would expect there to be very minimal impact over the years. The teams work through their own efforts to mitigate. And obviously that gets a little hard to measure along with the coronavirus impact. But we feel like the teams are very well positioned to mitigate the vast majority of the tariff impact for the next two year. So that's part of what changes the trajectory of that margin pressure as we head into next year, as well more of a stabilization of the services business as Matt talked about, as we lap all of the changes to the total tech support curve and all those things, next year, you have a bit of a stabilization there as well. In terms of your SGA leverage question, I think we would characterize that as two things, one, Matt mentioned the incentive comp implications over the last year and we are pretty specific about that. And then two, the cost reduction and efficiencies work that the team has done, at least the portions of that also flows through SG&A and that's a bit of where we're also picking up some of that leverage.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I apologize just for each one hitting on the coronavirus issue, its obviously topical. I mean, clearly as you've mentioned it's fluid. But I guess the question I have is, as you start to try to contemplate what impacts this could have on 2020 trends, could you help us understand what you're seeing if anything right now or are you seeing indications of supply chain disruptions at the moment or are they coming in the very near future? Thank you.\nMike Mohan: Hey, Brian. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. When we do all of our product forecasts on department [ph] selection process, as we have full visibility to what's coming into the country through a variety of sources from our top vendors, including the things we source directly. So what we're trying to infer in our guidance, I think, you see is there is a handful of issues around some items that are going to either be delayed or we have some constraints that add full transparency at [Technical Difficulty] we\u2019re not also speculating is any delayed launches of technology. And so I think about this a little bit how we thought about tariffs last year. You know, the U.S. market is the most important consumer electronics market in the world and we're a very significant part of that. And so when we think about high value goods and new technology and where consumer demand is everything gets prioritized for this part of the world. And I don't think that's going to change when things are back running at full speed and our partners want to work with Best Buy just like we're making sure everything we can do to help them during this trying time is in play. That's part of the best visibility I can give you right now.\nBrian Nagel: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then if I could just slip one quick follow up then. As we look at the fourth quarter gross margin and you called out a number of kind of transitory or unique factors that contributed to that decline. But is there a way you could parse it out more, just so we can understand the true margin performance of the business as we take into consideration guidance for flat margins here in the next year?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I think as we went into the quarter, we gave - I gave you the big buckets of where the pressure was. It was the product mix sales and vendor mix and then services category, as well as tariffs. Last time we spoke, we did go to indicate that most of those buckets kind of equally weighted. And again we implied this guidance to be down about 60 to 70 basis points. So you know, you can do the math there. As we went through the quarter, we also - as we just said a second ago, we did see a little bit more pressure on the mix for products and vendor mix, so that would make that a little bit more of the increase from where we expected it to be. If that helps?\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba: Good morning. I actually will not be asking a coronavirus related question. I actually wanted to talk a little about rent-to-own. I guess, I have two questions. First off is, you know, was offering rent-to-own financing a significant contributor to the domestic comp performance? And then the second question, you know, you mentioned, it sounds like you're going to be maybe advertising a bit more aggressively. You also mentioned having it online in the third quarter. I just wondered if you can just give us a little more color in terms of on the advertising piece in terms of what your plans are there for rent-to-own. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: So, good morning, Anthony. I'll start with the significant question. [Technical Difficulty] is definitely having a bit of a positive impact, but it is still relatively small in the scheme of things. And so it's not - I would not characterize it as significant to the nature of your question. Second in terms of advertising more or going online, we definitely think that having this as a digital offering is important, just giving the way we're seeing our customers shop, we want to be able to have this as an option online. So yes, you'll see that in Q3. From an advertising and marketing perspective, we've been doing some regional testing on that. I wouldn't expect to see it go full scale, put a ton of muscle behind a big marketing or advertising campaign. I think we feel right now this is mainly a referral process. As we've talked about before, we tend to start customers with our own branded private label card. And if for any reason they are aren\u2019t unable to qualify for that then we move on to the lease to own option. And so I think it's a little bit less about a large scale advertising effort. And we continue to see it as a nice secondary option. And look financing and purchasing is all about different purchase options and that's what we feel like we can provide you.\nAnthony Chukumba: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We want to focus on either the aggressiveness or the conservative nature of the gross margin expectation for \u201820 - fiscal 2021. So can you give us a sense for the cadence of gross margin over the course of the year, do you expect to be down in the front half and up in the back half? And what would have to go right for it to be better than that and what would have to be go wrong for it to be worse than that. And the question comes just on the heels of you missing your gross margin expectation in the fourth quarter because of mix.\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. Thank you. In terms of next year's gross profit rate, I would characterize, again the year we're expecting it to be flat and we outlined a little bit of the puts and takes there, I think from a benefit perspective we expect to see continued growth in our health business. And as Corie mentioned, continued cost reduction efficiencies helping us on the margin rate. On the under pressure side, what we will see a little bit pressure on the supply chain as we move bigger products through our supply chain system and we'll see a little bit of pressure there too. Tariffs will be a little of an impact, but again not a material impact next year. And services when you take out health, will be a little bit of a pressure next year, again as we're moving more light products. So those are kind of the major things that are benefiting and putting a little pressure on it. We're not going to get exact quarter guidance, things aren't always going to be the same in every quarter. But I wouldn't expect that any quarter to be much different than that - that basic makeup, meaning one materially down versus the other, at least as far as we can see right now, we do expect it to stabilize for most of the year and we will - some of that pressure we saw this Q4 we would expect to lap as we look into next year.\nMichael Lasser: If I can also add one clarifying question. Have you only assumed supply chain disruptions in your guidance. How long do you assume those will persist? And have you assumed anything about changes in behavior - consumer behavior because of all the headlines we're seeing?\nCorie Barry: Right now we have isolated it to supply chain disruption, because literally every consumer indicator and every more macro forecast that we can get our hands on right now would say you continue to see growth in the consumer and for us to predict exactly how the consumer is going to react, given how quickly this is evolving and changing every day, didn't seem prudent.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning. Maybe you've just given all the near-term noise here with the virus. I kind of want to step back and revisit the 5% long term EBIT margin target, right, given the achievement of that level in the U.S. segment this year. So if you can maybe just discuss how the expectation breaks down on a segment basis, right, as we look out and if possible provide some directional color around the EBIT margin structure for 2020, 2021 on a segment basis?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. So overall I think as we tried to achieve or as we look achieve the 5% goal in FY \u20192025, I think we've always talked about the path that, that wasn't going to exactly be linear. We did achieve a pretty high operating income rate end of the year. A chunk of that was actually due to the short term incentive favourability that we had. So as we look at next year and the years out, we still expect health to be a good contributor to that expansion of OI rate. Internationally, I would say more of the same, probably operating income rate more stabilized over that period of time. Domestic is where we'll probably see more of the expansion, as we look into FY \u201925 from a segment perspective.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered if I could talk about the holiday season, just how did you manage the 6 fewer days. And did you see any change in pattern or demand as a result? And just from a promotional standpoint with promotions coming earlier is that something that impacted gross margins during the quarter?\nCorie Barry: So I'll start and Mike can add anything he would like to. I think one of the things we're most proud of in terms of Q4 is that it really felt like our investments and our digital experiences and our supply chain were really paying off. And I would definitely extend kudos to our merchandising and marketing team who just did a great job, hitting promotions early in the holidays and ensuring that we had a really consistent plan throughout the holiday season. We said in our last call when we guided, we felt like the number of days was not nearly as large an impact as this year as it had been in the past. Meaning, because there are so many ways in which you can get product fulfilled and how we felt about our strength with next day, same day and particularly in-store pickup, which we said was 42% of what we sold online. We had a really unique ability to offer customers what they wanted on the terms that they wanted it. And so I think this was a period where we really felt like we could see the investments that we had chosen to make up to this point shine. Mike, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add.\nMike Mohan: I would just thanks Corie. Kate, I would just reinforce the efforts that we talked about at the investor event in September, really thinking about customer experience around fulfillment and what the role Best Buy could play you know, more on a long term basis. We knew the environment would be different than we've historically thought about the timeframe broader than just the days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and being able to deliver things that consumers wanted, when they want it and where did it played out well for us. And I think that's a big part of our strategy going forward.\nKate McShane: Okay. Thank you. And just one follow up, an unrelated question. I think you talked about the decline in warranty growth during the quarter. But within the guidance for services for 2020, it sounds like you said it would be up mid single digits. So I just wanted to know what the view is on warranties within that guidance or will the majority of growth be from the total tech support?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. Thank you for the question. Next year total tech support will drive most of our service growth next year. I think in Q4 we did see a bit of a lower warranty revenue. Maybe if you think about the mix of products we sold and heavier online mix as well those tend to put a little bit pressure on the warranty revenue which we saw in Q4. Next year we believe that stabilizes a bit and \u2013 but most of that growth we're going to see next year is on the total tech support side.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Nomura.\nMike Baker: Great, thanks. A couple of follow ups. In fact, I'll follow up right on the services question. So mid single digit from total tech support yet you have 2.3 million people signed up now and I think a year ago it was like a million. So that\u2019s like a double. So I guess why wouldn't that be growing more than mid single digit? That's one question. The second follow up is on incentive comp, you said 10 basis points it helped relative to your plan for the year and you'd already been planning it down in that 10 basis points if it was mostly in the fourth quarter, is like 30 basis points for the quarter. I guess, the two questions there is, one, in such a short amount time, how could have been so much better than plan, especially with the fourth quarter being a pretty strong quarter. Why would it have come in so much lower than planned? And in total how much did it help year-over-year, not just relative to plan? Thank you.\nCorie Barry: So the TTS, the total tech support side and the growth that we're driving there, we're actually seeing that grow and I think what you have to remember is this is one of those recurring revenue businesses that's going to pay back over time. There is growth there. On the flip side, we also plan to invest more in free installation and delivery, which eats away at some of that growth and also shows up in the services line. I think broadly, I would go back to, though, what\u2019s important to us is what we talked about at Investor Day, which is services as is defined in that line on our 10-Q, and then there are services as we think about it, which is a much broader definition and includes things like the membership that we talked about, in-home consultations, like the broad range of things we offer for customers. And so I would absolutely ask you not to just think about services as the revenue that you see there, but as a broader suite of things that we provide for our customers.\nMike Baker: Okay. Can I follow up on that? So when I pay the total tech support, which I am a member by the way, it was 199 spread out over a year. Does that does that fall into that services line item?\nCorie Barry: Yes.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks. Then on the incentive comp, again how could it have been so much better than plan if the fourth quarter is pretty good. And then what was the plan I guess?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah, as you can imagine every year we set the FDI Based on this year's budget and going into the quarter we had fourth - and then we changed the guidance forecast every quarter during the year. Going into Q4, we simply had a forecast that had us achieving some of those budgeted expectations that are the basis for both our store plans and our corporate plans and by the end of the quarter we said we just didn't get to those budget expectations and hence the better than expected incentive compensation for the quarter.\nMike Baker: So presumably they were gross margin plans, rather than sales plan?\nMatt Bilunas: We have - the predominance of our plans are both revenue and operating income.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thank you. Understood.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.\nRay Stochel: Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit more about the electronic sign label investment? I think we've seen that in stores. What exactly are you referring to there? How significant is it and how are you thinking about ROI and strategy there?\nMike Mohan: Hey, Ray. Its Mike. Thanks for the question. Yeah, you're correct. We have rolled out approximate 200 stores in our chain with electronic signs and we've been testing a variety of different ways of doing two things to truly see how to improve the customer experience with more accurate information on the tags, more flexibility on our pricing, which has a significant corollary [ph] benefit of having less people needed to physically change price tags. And as you could imagine in this omni channel world highly promotional timeframes like the end of November to the Christmas selling season we still have a lot of our employee labor dedicated to resetting the store, reprinting tags, heading up bundle promotions. We do a lot of unique things. We needed to really pilot this to understand it couldn't handle all the aspects of pricing for Best Buy because we're far different than a mass retailer or a grocery store. We're very happy with the outcomes that we're seeing and we finalize a program to scale this to the balance of chains. So we see that as a net benefit for us long term both on cost standpoint and employee engagement standpoint and most importantly our customer experience standpoint.\nRay Stochel: Great, thanks. And then could you give us a sense about - around how toys performed for you all this holiday. It looks like you've grown assortment over the last few years without Toys\"R\"Us in the market, is this a meaningful business for you all now. And are you seeing any of the overhangs that other retailers discussed? Thanks.\nMike Mohan: We are growing the toy assortment right, but it is not a meaningful business for us. And I don't think it will be. We look at toys as nice color to our gaming business and traditional gaming has been down, computing gaming is up significantly and we're always trying to find ways to meet our customers where they are from our shopping experience and we'll continue to do that. But it's not a very large part of our business today. I don't see it being that in the future.\nCorie Barry: I think the wonderful thing is the vast majority of our assortment is now been in toys by kids. When you think about iPad, when you think about computing gaming, I mean, toys for us such a bigger answer because of the way kids are growing up today what they value in life. So it's not just about the toys open for us, it's about being positioned right at holiday to finish the list, like Mike said.\nRay Stochel: Great. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks, guys. I think I wanted to touch on just the kind of the cadence of new technology coming to market. I know Corie you kind of outlined some of the things in the next couple of years. But I know there's been some thoughts with 5G will really be a 2021 event and that the 8K TV cycle might disappoint a little bit. So I was just trying to get your view on kind of the cadence of new technology coming to market?\nMike Mohan: Scott, I'll start and Corie could definitely chime in. I mean, we're always excited about what technology has given, the role we play. I think it's both, it's a short term and a long term game. What I mean by that is short term there's a lot of noise out there around what 5G is or isn't from the mobile networks or consolidation that likely is going to occur and that's just going to create confusion for consumers, when that happens, I think Best Buy plays a significant role. There's an advantage with a 5G network will do today, but we're just starting to scratch the surface on what it will do longer term when I think about it from an overall standpoint of being connected both mobile and in your home. I think Best Buy's position is \u2013 we\u2019re excited about it. We're going to continue to lead it innovation that\u2019s currently helping consumers to understand what it can do. And it will drive some demand on the mobile sector regardless because of the new devices that come out that people want to understand. The second question on 8K TV, I think the technology well - it's interesting what it does, what it really does it enables customers to get a better quality, larger television set and that is one of the key driving things that we see. When consumers bring something on one of the reasons we actually get TVs returned today, one of the top reasons that they didn't buy it, as big of a TV as they thought they should have, even though they had the space and the better the TV can look with 8K resolution, it helps easier to have that conversation with the consumer and get them what they really  So we see as a driver for large screen TV and that's been a significant part of the business segment to date and I think it will continue to drive going forward.\nCorie Barry: And the only thing I would add to what Mike said is that, when it relates to 5G I think we have a really unique advantage here. When we think about our very localized market based strategy and combined with our ability to commercialize new products which will be coming over the next, to your point, multitude of years, we can help customers because it's going to be market by market and it's going to be confusing for customers because at some point we'll be available some it won\u2019t. And this is where I think our market strategy and our ability to commercialize technology really will show up over a multitude of years here. And with that, go ahead\u2026\nScott Mushkin: No I was just going to because no one touched on it yet, I just wanted a quick thought on the health care initiatives and what kind of pushback you get from healthcare providers. I know it's right at the end, but I was just wondering if you can give us color there? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yeah, I think \u2013 and you're probably mainly referring to the commercial side of the business which is where we're working on some partner - with providers. I think it's less about pushback and it's more about how do we collectively move it. It's very new, it's very different, actually everyone is very interested in health care in the home. There isn't a partner we talk to is not interested. It's a question of how do you fit it into the existing reimbursement methodologies, existing system, existing way we think about care and how do you provide enough room for test and pilot at a small level, so we can learn enough that it makes it worthwhile to roll out on a larger scale. So it's not - it's not actually pushback. There's a lot of interest. It's a question of how best do you start a pilot and then scale.\nCorie Barry: And with that, I think that's the last question. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our next call in May regarding our Q1 results. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $15.2 we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $2.90 both of which exceeded our expectations. We had better than expected revenue results both online and within our International business. From a category perspective, we saw stronger than expected performance from computing and headphones, whereas gaming and smart home were a bit softer compared to our previous estimates. As Corie mentioned, our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was driven by lower SG&A, which was primarily the result of lower than expected incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. This was partially offset by a lower than expected gross profit rate. I will share additional details on the gross profit rate drivers later in my prepared remarks. The favourability - the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a net $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate that was partially offset by a higher share count. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 2.7% to $15.2 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 3.2%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.18 or 7% to $2.90. This increase was driven by a $0.12 per share benefit from the net share count change and a $0.06 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 2.6% to $13.85 billion. The comparable sales increase of 3.4% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets.  These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming category. In addition, comparable sales in the services category were essentially flat to last year. As we shared previously, the slower growth, as compared to previous quarters is primarily due to lapping the refinement of revenue recognition for our total tech support offer we made in Q4 of last year. Within the quarter, growth from total tech support revenue was largely offset by a decline in warranty revenue. Looking forward, we expect comparable sales growth in the services category to be in the mid single digit range next quarter. Domestic online revenue of $3.5 million was 25.4% of domestic revenue, up from 21.9% percent last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 18.7% over the fourth quarter of last year. The growth was primarily driven by higher average order values, but also benefited from increased traffic and improved conversion rates. In our International segment, revenue increased 3.4% to $1.35 billion, primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.6% and approximately 150 [ph] basis points of positive foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate was 21.2% versus 22.1% last year. The 90 basis point decrease was primarily driven by items we shared on last quarter's call, these included one, an unfavorable sales mix of products, two, rate pressure in our services category and three, impacts associated with tariffs on goods imported from China, which was largely aligned with our expectations heading into the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced more pressure from product mix than we previously expected due to heavier mix in certain vendor products. International gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 22.6%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $48 million compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, which was partially offset by a number of items, including variable expenses associated with higher revenue and higher advertising. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A decreased approximately 70 basis points to 14.7%. I would like to say a few words on incentive compensation expense, which has been a driver of lowest SG&A expense compared to last year throughout fiscal '20. Most of the variability over the course of the year has been due to last year's results, significantly exceeding our incentive performance targets. Compared to our original expectations at the start of the year, lower than planned incentive compensation had an approximately 10 basis point favorable impact to our full year fiscal \u201820 operating income rate, but nearly all of the impact occurring in fourth quarter. International SG&A of $215 billion increased $8 million and was flat to last year as a percentage of revenue. The $8 million increase was primarily driven by expense associated with new store locations in Mexico and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. As Corie said, during fiscal \u201820 we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders though $1 billion in share repurchases, $527 million in dividends. This morning we announced that we increased our quarterly dividend 10% to $0.55 per share and provided an outlook for share repurchases of $750 million to $1 billion in fiscal \u201821 I would now like to talk about our outlook. Our full year fiscal \u201821 financial guidance is the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $43.3 billion to $44.3 billion. Enterprise comparable sales of flat to 2%, enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.8%, enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.10 to $6.30 and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23%. I would like to call it a number of assumptions. We expect to continue to operate in a positive consumer environment in 2020. As Corie mentioned earlier, our revenue guidance also includes our best estimate of the impacts from supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. We expect our gross profit rate to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of revenue is expected to be slightly up to fiscal '20. As it relates to capital expenditures, we plan to spend in the range of $800 million to $900 million, as we continue to build the capabilities needed to execute our strategy. The increase in capital expenditures will include some of the areas Corie noted previously, such as deploying electronic sign labels and continued investments in technology, health and supply chain. As it relates to the first quarter, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of flat to 1%, non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.05 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 22.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 260 million shares. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Sure. This is Matt. I'll start with that. First, as [Technical Difficulty] remarks, believe we're operating in a very positive consumer environment similar to last year, all the data points indicate a good consumer unemployment is good, wage growth is good, consumer spending is good and wage forecast. That being said, separately there is some supply chain related issues as a result of the coronavirus. So on the low end of our guide we would assume that there is a material disruption - supply chain disruption from that, and we \u2013 and that we can't make it all up in the year. So that's one reason, as we said we did factor in the coronavirus outbreak into the overall guidance and the range. We're still very positive about of number of initiatives that we have, such as IHA and TTS growth. There are certain categories that we still expect to perform strongly next year, such as appliances and headphones. Like I said total tech support is still an area of growth for us next year. Gaming would be an area where we are expecting it to be down on a year-over-year basis as well. We do expect to see new console launches in holiday period next year, but the first three quarters will be down or we expect to be down. And then we still have moderate assumptions for TV and mobile phones to the extent that there is better adoption, some of those new technologies like 5G and 8K then that could help move us up towards that range. So to your earlier point, yes we did try to factor in the coronavirus outbreak into the overall year end and that did have some impact to the overall guidance. Sure, as it relates to gross profit in Q4 I think the implied guidance going into the quarter - excuse me, assumed about 60 to 70 basis points of pressure. What we saw in the quarter largely played out with what we expected in the same areas. As a reminder what we said was one of the buckets was unfavorable sales mix of products and vendor mix was part of that. Services pressure was another aspect to the pressure we saw going into the quarter. And then as well we factored in tariffs on imported goods from China, largely those all still played out. What we did see was a little bit more pressure on the sales and vendor mix than we expected. During the quarter, we made a point to meet the market in a few key categories, we weren't leading the market from a promotional perspective. In those categories, the customer demand was very high, even higher than we probably even expected going into it and the mix so that had a negative impact on margins. So we don't believe that we wouldn't characterize it as irrational or overly promotional, more or more or less just meeting the customer demand in a very thoughtful way. And if you step back and look at the entire year, the full year gross profit was down 20 basis points. Q4 was of - most of that decreased. And as we said next year we're expecting gross margin rates to be flat. So we do believe that pressure will start to stabilize next year. Now we're not going to guide every quarter and we don't expect it all be the same. But from a full year perspective we do expect some of that to stabilize through the next year. Sure. I think as we went into the quarter, we gave - I gave you the big buckets of where the pressure was. It was the product mix sales and vendor mix and then services category, as well as tariffs. Last time we spoke, we did go to indicate that most of those buckets kind of equally weighted. And again we implied this guidance to be down about 60 to 70 basis points. So you know, you can do the math there. As we went through the quarter, we also - as we just said a second ago, we did see a little bit more pressure on the mix for products and vendor mix, so that would make that a little bit more of the increase from where we expected it to be. If that helps? Yeah. Thank you. In terms of next year's gross profit rate, I would characterize, again the year we're expecting it to be flat and we outlined a little bit of the puts and takes there, I think from a benefit perspective we expect to see continued growth in our health business. And as Corie mentioned, continued cost reduction efficiencies helping us on the margin rate. On the under pressure side, what we will see a little bit pressure on the supply chain as we move bigger products through our supply chain system and we'll see a little bit of pressure there too. Tariffs will be a little of an impact, but again not a material impact next year. And services when you take out health, will be a little bit of a pressure next year, again as we're moving more light products. So those are kind of the major things that are benefiting and putting a little pressure on it. We're not going to get exact quarter guidance, things aren't always going to be the same in every quarter. But I wouldn't expect that any quarter to be much different than that - that basic makeup, meaning one materially down versus the other, at least as far as we can see right now, we do expect it to stabilize for most of the year and we will - some of that pressure we saw this Q4 we would expect to lap as we look into next year. Sure. So overall I think as we tried to achieve or as we look achieve the 5% goal in FY '2025, I think we've always talked about the path that, that wasn't going to exactly be linear. We did achieve a pretty high operating income rate end of the year. A chunk of that was actually due to the short term incentive favourability that we had. So as we look at next year and the years out, we still expect health to be a good contributor to that expansion of OI rate. Internationally, I would say more of the same, probably operating income rate more stabilized over that period of time. Domestic is where we'll probably see more of the expansion, as we look into FY '25 from a segment perspective. Yeah. Thank you for the question. Next year total tech support will drive most of our service growth next year. I think in Q4 we did see a bit of a lower warranty revenue. Maybe if you think about the mix of products we sold and heavier online mix as well those tend to put a little bit pressure on the warranty revenue which we saw in Q4. Next year we believe that stabilizes a bit and \u2013 but most of that growth we're going to see next year is on the total tech support side. Thank you. Yeah, as you can imagine every year we set the FDI Based on this year's budget and going into the quarter we had fourth - and then we changed the guidance forecast every quarter during the year. Going into Q4, we simply had a forecast that had us achieving some of those budgeted expectations that are the basis for both our store plans and our corporate plans and by the end of the quarter we said we just didn't get to those budget expectations and hence the better than expected incentive compensation for the quarter. We have - the predominance of our plans are both revenue and operating income."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we are excited to report strong Q4 results with revenue of $15.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.90. Our enterprise comparable sales growth for the quarter was 3.2% above the high end of our guidance range and on top of 3% last year. We are posting our 12th straight quarter of comparable sales growth and showing our strength as a successful multi-channel retailer who can meet customers when and where they want. We offered compelling holiday deals that resonated with customers and provided a seamless shopping experience, great inventory availability and fast free delivery. Across online home and stores, we are fulfilling our purpose to help enrich people's lives with technology, while also helping technology companies commercialize their products innovation. Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 3.4%. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, partially offset by gains. We also saw continued growth from our transformative initiatives, like total tech support and in-home consultation. The enterprise Q4 non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.5% was better than we expected due to lower SG&A expense. On the gross profit rate line, the mix of products we sold in the quarter drove a lower rate than we anticipated. For the full year, we grew enterprise comparable sales to 2.1%, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate 30 basis points and increased our non-GAAP earnings per share of 14% to $6. 07. We also returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we are proud of these results and I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work, commitment to serving customers, and amazing execution as we navigated ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment and the challenging tariff situation. Against that backdrop, our associates also continue to drive significant progress against our building the New Blue strategy. We believe our strategy will uniquely position us over the long term by leveraging our combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. Let me provide some highlights of our progress, starting with how we are better serving our existing customers. We continue to innovate and design digital experiences that solve customer needs across online and physical shopping. This includes enhancing our digital shopping platform with new functionality and evolving our marketing strategy to drive engagement with our customers with a particular focus on our app. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and usage grew significantly through the year. In fiscal \u201820 customer visits to the app were up 22% overall and usage of our app within our stores was up approximately 17%. Customers on the Best Buy app engage with us eight times more frequently than those who solely use our website or mobile site. At the same time, we continue to transform our supply chain using automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve the delivery and installation experience. We also continue to improve the buy online, pickup in-store experience for our customers, including the introduction of curbside pickup and alternate pickup locations. As a result of all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation, in Q4 we promised free next day delivery on thousands of items, all season long to 99% of our customers, with no membership or minimum purchase required. And we also promised online customers who wanted to pick up in store that their items would be ready within one hour of placing an order. As a result store pickup was up over 500 basis points to 42% of online sales in Q4. All of these improvements were made with our customer experiences in mind and they contributed to continued online growth for the year. We saw particularly strong results in the fourth quarter where online sales grew 18.7% and represented 25% of our total domestic revenue. For the year, online sales represented almost 20% of our domestic revenue. We also focused on enhancing the in-home experience for our customers. During fiscal '20, we expanded our in-home consultation program from 530 to 725 advisors. This combined with tools to maximize their productivity helped us decrease the amount of time customers were waiting for an advisor appointment. A key driver of NPS and close rates and allowed us to provide more than 250,000 free in-home consultations to customers across the nation. Both employees and customers continued to love it. The Net Promoter Score for purchasers is high at 87 and the advisor employee turnover remains low. Additionally, we are now seeing a growing percentage of repeat purchases, as customers develop and take advantage of their relationship with their advisors. This of course was the intent when we began the program and we're delighted to see these relationships being built as we continue to increase investment in technology that is perfectly suited for this new kind of seamless customer interaction. Providing 24 by 7 support for all their technology needs is another way we build relationships with our customers. Our total Tech Support Program grew steadily during fiscal \u201820 to end the year with almost 2.3 million members. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice of likely to use other services than non-members. The average member uses the program approximately 2.5 times per year. During the year we also rolled out pilots to test new member requested benefits related to networking, parental controls and data storage. We also made progress on our initiatives to capture new demand and enter new spaces. In fiscal '20, we became the nation's largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repaired, almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven't made a purchase in the last year. Turning to Best Buy Health, during fiscal '20, we continue to advance our initiatives designed to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. We successfully integrated two additional acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We are encouraged by the integration with Best Buy and the conversations we are having with potential partners. Of course, our success with customers and the progress we are making on our building the New Blue strategy is driven by the enthusiasm, talent and purposeful leadership of our employee. During fiscal '20, we continue to invest in wages, training and many new employee benefits, including paid time off for part time employees, paid caregiver leaves, expanded mental health benefits, enhanced adoption assistance and a new surrogacy assistance benefit. Our employee engagement is high and our turnover rates in our stores remain in the low 30% range compared to 50% five years ago. Additionally, our average store general manager has been in his or her store for about six years, which is incredibly important from a store leadership and community perspective. In parallel to the customer experience work, during fiscal \u201820 we continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressure. In the middle of the year, we completed the existing $600 million cost reduction target that we expect in fiscal \u201818. In September we announced our new target of an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiency by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $160 million toward our new goal in the back half of the year. We are also proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts. In fact, we were just named the top five on Barron's Annual 100 most sustainable companies list for the third consecutive year. You can find more information about our efforts in our annual corporate responsibility and sustainability report which can be found at investors.bestbuy.com. Similarly, would like to note our progress related to our teen tech centers, a program we are very proud of and passionate about. These centers are after school learning spaces, equipped with cutting-edge technology where teens learn new tech skills, gain exposure to new career possibilities and benefit from positive adult and peer relationships. We have that at 11 teen centers in the past year for a total of 33 locations across the country. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in this program, with plans to open 11 new centers this year. And we know this work is making a difference, 91% of teens say they are more optimistic about their futures because of their time at the teen tech centers and 73% say they are interested or very interested in studying some aspect of stem in the future. I'm also incredibly proud to report that Best Buy was once again the top partner for the St. Jude. Thanks and Giving campaign, helping raise a record $22 million through customer and employee donations in our stores and online this holiday season. That pushes our cumulative total to more than $100 million raised for the kids of St. Jude since we first partnered in 2013. As we enter fiscal '21, we are excited about our opportunities and are encouraged by our momentum. As a reminder, back in September, we set three fiscal 25 targets focused on employees, customers and financial. First to be one of the best companies to work for in the US, exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Second, double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support membership, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services and senior life supporting. And third, deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal \u201825. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities, while maintaining profitability over time. I would like to highlight some focus areas for this year. First, in service of our existing customer, we will continue to bring our deep CE expertise and unique ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. In this context, we are excited by the opportunities related to technology innovation over the next several years. As we have discussed previously, these are technologies like 8K, OLED, dual screen notebook computers, multiple phones, consumer health products, connected fitness, new gaming consoles, and new products that leveraged 5G capability. We will also launch new categories where we can leverage our digital first mindset, supported by our expertise around curation and supply chain. Some of these will be online only and include areas such as hearing aids, sustainable living products, expanded connected fitness initiative and travel and luggage. These are categories that we believe our customers would expect to find at Best Buy. From a digital standpoint, we will continue to drive engagement with customers during their shopping and ownership journey, while making it a seamless as possible for customers as they interact with us across channels. For example in the app we will make it much easier for customers to discover and benefit from the support services we offer, including scheduling appointments, which is something that currently requires a separate app download. We also plan to utilize location data to make it even easier and more intuitive for customers in the app to see both products availability and the expanding options for fulfillment. From an in-home standpoint, we will continue to enhance the experience for customers, while at the same time testing new opportunities for growth and becoming more efficient in the way we are serving customers in their home. As I mentioned earlier, we now have over 720 in-home advisors and we continue to receive great customer feedback. In fiscal '21, we are testing new tiered advisor roles that will match the right employee with the right customer need. We are also continuing to enhance our clienteling technology platform to drive better customer experiences. For example, the platform can increasingly help our advisors use knowledge about their client's current and future need to proactively communicate new promotions and product launches over time that can help meet those customers. In addition to our in-home advisors, we also have approximately 900 Magnolia System Designers, all of whom are supported by nearly 6000 Geek Squad agents, core train and premium home theater and custom installation. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to build upon all of these great resources collectively to enhance the customer experience. Our stores remain incredibly important and must work in tandem with our digital and in-home experiences. In fiscal \u201821, we will continue to enhance both the proficiency of our store associates and optimize the way they work in order to drive stronger customer relationships. We are also investing in technology, including the rollout of electronic shelf labels to all of our stores, to enhance the customer experience and generate cost savings through added efficiency. Additionally, we will test and learn from a small number of new store and remodel pilot with a focus on fulfillment and differentiated shopping experiences for our customers. We will continue to develop and hone our local market focus by leveraging the strategic changes we made last year to our field operation. Designed to create a more seamless experience across channels, these changes put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their markets. These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights data and analytics to view a markets largest opportunity and fast track initiative to accelerate growth. In total tech support, our focus will be on driving new memberships and ensuring our members continue to see the offering and something they can't live without. We know that our members tend to use the offering more in the initial months after becoming a member and our goal is to continue to see the usage increase over time across their membership. As we shared at our Investor update last September, we see an opportunity over time to evolve our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We plan to roll out pilots during the year as we work on the best way to simplify offering and move from managing the economics offer by offer which is how we look at it today to a more holistic and streamlined offering that is centered on the customer. Turning to our focus on capturing new demand and entering new spaces, in fiscal \u201821 we plan to expand our lease to own purchase option, by building awareness throughout the year and then adding an option for customers to use lease to own for online transactions in the third quarter. Now I would like to talk about Best Buy Health. As we shared before most of the seniors we currently serve are utilizing easy to use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. For example with our health and safety services, customers can talk to US based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. As we enter fiscal '21, there are a number of developments that we believe will accelerate the growth of this direct to consumer business. First, we are launching a number of new products and services, including a new mobile medical alert device, also called PERS, a wearable device, an app designed for both seniors and their caregivers. Second, we are enhancing the customer experience in our Best Buy stores. This includes expanded shelf space and merchandising presentation, as well as the ability for sales associates to help customers activate their devices at the time of purchase, so they can start using the services right away. Third, we have a new distribution agreement with Walgreens to carry our new PERS, device in 6600 Walgreens stores across the country and walgreens.com. Fourth, we signed a new AARP agreement, whereby the organization's 38 million members will get exclusive discounts on our health and safety devices. At the same time we will continue to focus on the commercial health opportunities, where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by health plans, health System and others in the senior care industry. There is a high level of interest in our unique combination of tech and touch and the potential we have to reduce health care costs and bring greater peace of mind for seniors and their families and caregivers. As we expected when we entered the state, the health care industry has long sales cycles and this side of the business will take longer to ramp than the direct to consumer side. Turning to supply chain, we will focus on leveraging automation across the supply chain network and offering customers free next day delivery, which we view as table stakes across the industry. We will also continue to roll out enhancements to buy online, pickup in store to make it even more convenient for our customers to get their products, including alternate pickup locations, as well as curbside pickup at Best Buy store. We have just expanded alternate pickup to approximately 2000 locations across 9 markets and plan to expand to more markets throughout fiscal \u201821. These alternate pickup locations are in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship to home option is not desired. Last quarter we also introduced curbside pickup at approximately 100 stores, which allows customers to pick up their tech without even getting out of their car. Customers are finding value in this option as curbside already accounts for 15% of store pickup units at those locations and we plan to expand this service to the majority of our stores in fiscal '21. Of course to bring all of the initiatives we have just discussed to light, we will need to invest in technology. It is imperative to the success of our strategy that we continue to improve our clienteling and CRM program, enhance our data and analytics capabilities and drive artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation. Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to note that we are closely monitoring the developments related to the coronavirus and our thoughts are with all of those who have been affected. We remain focused on supporting our people and vendor partners during this time. As you all know this is a very fluid situation that is changing daily and that it is very difficult to determine exact financial impact. Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimate at this time. Based on what we know today, we have assumed the majority of the impacts occur in the first half of the year. Therefore we view this as a relatively short term disruption that does not impact our long term strategy and initiative. For the year, we expect comp growth of flat to up 2% and a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.8%. This guide reflects our continued investment in those areas necessary to make strategic progress and deliver enhanced employee and customer experiences, as well as our continued focus on driving cost savings and efficiency. We remain confident that our fiscal \u201821 plan moves us along the path to achieve our fiscal \u201825 targets, specifically the financial targets of $50 billion in revenue at a 5% operating income rate. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter and full year and our amazing team are motivated and ready to deliver on our fiscal \u201821 initiatives. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting work underway and ahead of us. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter results and our guidance. So - Peter this is Corie. I think trying to size perfectly the coronavirus impact at this point is incredibly difficult. I think you as much as anyone would respect it, it's incredibly fluid situation. We are trying to for Q1 and the full year estimate as best we can the impact, mainly in the form of lower sales volume, as you could imagine and we literally so far have gone vendor-by-vendor to analyze the size of the impact. But it is complicated and very difficult to size. And we're trying to weigh things like which factories are back up and running and they're all at varying capacities across Asia. Even if the product isn't final produced in Asia, some people are waiting for components that may flow from there. There are varying levels of safety stock across the industry and global vendors have varying levels of global inventory and then obviously estimating the transportation situation once the production comes back it is also difficult. And so based on what we know today, we're assuming the majority of the impact is in the first half and we do view it as a relatively short term disruption that doesn't impact our longer term strategy. But obviously right now we are isolating our approach to the supply chain impacts. And as Matt said, we're assuming the consumer continues on a relatively good pace. So there's still a lot for us to learn there, which means sizing it perfectly just doesn't seem appropriate at this point. Thank you. I think some of our - I'm sorry, go forward in nature for next year and the reason we think they stabilized a bit more, there's a couple of things. One, while tariffs had some impact on Q4 for the next year we would expect there to be very minimal impact over the years. The teams work through their own efforts to mitigate. And obviously that gets a little hard to measure along with the coronavirus impact. But we feel like the teams are very well positioned to mitigate the vast majority of the tariff impact for the next two year. So that's part of what changes the trajectory of that margin pressure as we head into next year, as well more of a stabilization of the services business as Matt talked about, as we lap all of the changes to the total tech support curve and all those things, next year, you have a bit of a stabilization there as well. In terms of your SGA leverage question, I think we would characterize that as two things, one, Matt mentioned the incentive comp implications over the last year and we are pretty specific about that. And then two, the cost reduction and efficiencies work that the team has done, at least the portions of that also flows through SG&A and that's a bit of where we're also picking up some of that leverage. So, good morning, Anthony. I'll start with the significant question. [Technical Difficulty] is definitely having a bit of a positive impact, but it is still relatively small in the scheme of things. And so it's not - I would not characterize it as significant to the nature of your question. Second in terms of advertising more or going online, we definitely think that having this as a digital offering is important, just giving the way we're seeing our customers shop, we want to be able to have this as an option online. So yes, you'll see that in Q3. From an advertising and marketing perspective, we've been doing some regional testing on that. I wouldn't expect to see it go full scale, put a ton of muscle behind a big marketing or advertising campaign. I think we feel right now this is mainly a referral process. As we've talked about before, we tend to start customers with our own branded private label card. And if for any reason they are aren't unable to qualify for that then we move on to the lease to own option. And so I think it's a little bit less about a large scale advertising effort. And we continue to see it as a nice secondary option. And look financing and purchasing is all about different purchase options and that's what we feel like we can provide you. Right now we have isolated it to supply chain disruption, because literally every consumer indicator and every more macro forecast that we can get our hands on right now would say you continue to see growth in the consumer and for us to predict exactly how the consumer is going to react, given how quickly this is evolving and changing every day, didn't seem prudent. So I'll start and Mike can add anything he would like to. I think one of the things we're most proud of in terms of Q4 is that it really felt like our investments and our digital experiences and our supply chain were really paying off. And I would definitely extend kudos to our merchandising and marketing team who just did a great job, hitting promotions early in the holidays and ensuring that we had a really consistent plan throughout the holiday season. We said in our last call when we guided, we felt like the number of days was not nearly as large an impact as this year as it had been in the past. Meaning, because there are so many ways in which you can get product fulfilled and how we felt about our strength with next day, same day and particularly in-store pickup, which we said was 42% of what we sold online. We had a really unique ability to offer customers what they wanted on the terms that they wanted it. And so I think this was a period where we really felt like we could see the investments that we had chosen to make up to this point shine. Mike, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add. So the TTS, the total tech support side and the growth that we're driving there, we're actually seeing that grow and I think what you have to remember is this is one of those recurring revenue businesses that's going to pay back over time. There is growth there. On the flip side, we also plan to invest more in free installation and delivery, which eats away at some of that growth and also shows up in the services line. I think broadly, I would go back to, though, what's important to us is what we talked about at Investor Day, which is services as is defined in that line on our 10-Q, and then there are services as we think about it, which is a much broader definition and includes things like the membership that we talked about, in-home consultations, like the broad range of things we offer for customers. And so I would absolutely ask you not to just think about services as the revenue that you see there, but as a broader suite of things that we provide for our customers. Yes. I think the wonderful thing is the vast majority of our assortment is now been in toys by kids. When you think about iPad, when you think about computing gaming, I mean, toys for us such a bigger answer because of the way kids are growing up today what they value in life. So it's not just about the toys open for us, it's about being positioned right at holiday to finish the list, like Mike said. And the only thing I would add to what Mike said is that, when it relates to 5G I think we have a really unique advantage here. When we think about our very localized market based strategy and combined with our ability to commercialize new products which will be coming over the next, to your point, multitude of years, we can help customers because it's going to be market by market and it's going to be confusing for customers because at some point we'll be available some it won't. And this is where I think our market strategy and our ability to commercialize technology really will show up over a multitude of years here. And with that, go ahead... Yeah, I think \u2013 and you're probably mainly referring to the commercial side of the business which is where we're working on some partner - with providers. I think it's less about pushback and it's more about how do we collectively move it. It's very new, it's very different, actually everyone is very interested in health care in the home. There isn't a partner we talk to is not interested. It's a question of how do you fit it into the existing reimbursement methodologies, existing system, existing way we think about care and how do you provide enough room for test and pilot at a small level, so we can learn enough that it makes it worthwhile to roll out on a larger scale. So it's not - it's not actually pushback. There's a lot of interest. It's a question of how best do you start a pilot and then scale. And with that, I think that's the last question. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our next call in May regarding our Q1 results. Have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we have reported $9.76 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.13, which was up 22% compared to the third quarter of last year. We delivered another strong quarter and are excited about our continued momentum and the opportunities we have ahead of us. Our teams continued to execute well and navigate ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment, and the uncertain tariff situation. And they are doing all this while making significant progress against our Building the New Blue strategy, which we believe will uniquely position us over the long-term. Specifically, our comparable sales growth of 1.7% was on top of 4.3% last year and above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our Domestic segment comparable sales were up 2%, as we continue to focus on the customer experience across online, stores, and at home. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in appliances, headphones, tablets, and computing, partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. The Q3 profitability was better-than-expected. This was primarily the result of lower SG&A, due to strong expense management, a reflection of the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. The Q3 gross profit rate was flat on a year-over-year basis. Due to the strong Q3 results, we are updating our annual guidance today. Matt will discuss in more detail later in the call, but at a high level we are maintaining the topline guidance we shared last quarter, while raising the non-GAAP EPS guidance. We are now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.81 to $5.91. This compares to the original guidance of $5.45 to $5.65 that we provided last February as we entered the year. As it relates to tariffs, our assumptions of the impact on our business are basically unchanged from our last call. As a reminder, our guidance includes our best estimate of the impact of all tariffs, both implemented and planned, including List 3 at 25%, List 4A at 15%, which was implemented on September 1, and List 4B at 15% which is planned for December 15. As we shared at our Investor Update in September, we are entering the second chapter of Building the New Blue. Our purpose remains the same: to enrich lives through technology. Our strategy is to leverage our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs, and build more and deeper relationships with our customers. We introduced three five-year goals at our Investor Update focused on employees, customers, and financials. As a reminder, they are: first, to be one of the best companies to work for in the U.S., exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Second, to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services, and senior life support. And third, to deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal 2025. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time. Last quarter, we talked about how our penetration by geographic market varies widely, yet our tools and structure have been one-size-fits-all for our local markets. To better serve existing customers, we made strategic changes to our field operations to accelerate growth and to create a more seamless experience across channels, putting single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain, and home propositions in their market. These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights, data, and analytics, to view market\u2019s largest opportunities and fast-track initiatives that will make a financial impact as well as provide a more seamless customer experience. For example, in the New York area, we are focused on expanding both our fulfillment options and in-home resources. During the quarter, we launched 175 alternate pickup locations for customers in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship-to-home option is not desired. These alternate locations are in UPS stores and CVS stores in the New York market. In New York, as well as Los Angeles and Chicago, online customers can order as late as 8 p.m. and still receive their products the next day for free. Starting in New York, we are also adding the ability for online customers who want their product the same day to select specific three-hour delivery window for that same day delivery. And for those online customers who prefer to pick up the products themselves, we are beginning the process of rolling out curbside pickup at stores in the New York market, where a Best Buy employee will bring the product directly to the customer\u2019s car. To build awareness of these expanded experiences, we have already kicked off a comprehensive local market marketing campaign that includes stores, train stations, billboards, digital, and email. Based on our data, we believe there is much untapped opportunity to serve New York clients in their homes. To capitalize on that opportunity, we are building capacity by adding additional in-home advisors and also increasing the training for existing advisors. We have combined additional resources from both the field and corporate teams to provide these new advisors an accelerated, locally focused training program that we believe will speed up their ramp-up time. This will free up capacity for our existing advisors in the market to receive more training designed to strengthen their clienteling skills, which will lead to deeper customer relationships. Based on local market analysis, we have also added capacity across the country where we continue to see strong customer demand for our in-home consultation program. On a national level during the quarter we added 100 in-home advisors to end the quarter with approximately 720 advisors. As we shared at our Investor Updates, 95% of those polled said they would continue working with their in-home advisor and we continue to see higher spend at a higher gross profit rates from our in-home advisor customers versus other customers. We expect our advisors will become more and more productive as we advance our CRM system and enhance our digital tools. Another important way we are better serving customers and building relationships is through our Total Tech Support program. Total Tech Support provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all of their technology no matter where or when they bought it, in addition to great discounts and installations, protection and in-home services. We have grown the membership to over 2 million members from about 200,000 when we launched nationally in May of last year. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice as likely to use other services than non-members. We are building on this early success to continue to deliver more benefits our members are asking for. For example, we are piloting a program, we are calling Total Tech Support with networking that includes routers setup and installation, parental controls to manage every device on the network, a subscription to Microsoft Office 365, and 1 terabyte of cloud storage along with all the standard Total Tech Support benefits. We are also continuing to add new services and capabilities that have the potential to attract new customers. As we shared last quarter, Best Buy is now fully certified chain wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation\u2019s largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services including same day iPhone repairs. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven\u2019t made a purchase in the last year. Our lease to own purchasing option is now fully rolled out in 45 states after we added the last nine states including California and New York just a few weeks ago. This provides another purchasing option in addition to our existing strong credit card offer allowing us to help customers make purchases they might not otherwise be able to. Since we began rolling out the program nationally in March, approximately 65% of lease to own customers are either new to Best Buy or haven\u2019t made a purchase in the last year. We also remain focused on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. We continue to enhance our digital shopping platforms both online and on our mobile app, with new functionality and a better customer experience. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and year-to-date usage of the app is up more than 20%, and usage of our app within our stores is up more than 30%. Our store employees love the app, which has also been improved with their needs in mind. They can now much more quickly see pricing, promotions, inventory and fulfillment times, through features such as Top Deals, which I will discuss in a moment, and expanded availability options. The app also provides employees other recommended products if a certain product is out of stock in their store. During the quarter, we materially changed the way we present product deals to our customers. Several years ago, we created a digital version of our weekly ad as we transitioned away from the paper weekly ad that was distributed every Sunday. We no longer distribute any paper weekly ads, and during Q3, we sun-setted the rigid digital weekly ad technology platform and launched a Top Deals section in our app and on our website. This leverages cost and gives us more flexibility to introduce multiple promotional cycles within the week and ensure we featuring our best offers. Most importantly, Top Deals provides a better user experience and helps customers find products faster with fewer clicks, resulting in higher and more consistent traffic throughout the week and better conversion compared to the old experience. At our Investor Update in September, we also spent time talking about the significant opportunity we see in the health space. Specifically, we have reiterated our focus on helping seniors live longer in their homes through our unique combination of tap and touch, thereby reducing their health care costs and bringing greater peace of mind for them and their families and caregivers. We serve approximately 1 million seniors right now and we shared our goal to serve 5 million seniors in fiscal 2025. Today, most of the seniors we serve are utilizing easy-to-use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. With our five star service, customers can talk to U.S. based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. We expect to continue to scale this business over time in order to reach our five-year target. We also expect to advance our commercial business where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by insurance providers. This includes services such as remote monitoring based solutions that provide meaningful insights to improve timely care and reduce the cost to serve frail seniors. As previously discussed, we have successfully closed and integrated three acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We have also hired additional talent to deepen our expertise. That includes Dr. Daniel Grossman, our new Chief Medical Officer for Best Buy Health. He is a practicing emergency medicine physician at a major academic medical center in Rochester, Minnesota, with extensive strategy and business development experiences at leading health tech companies. He has been on all sides of health care, physicians, patients, payer, disrupter and educator. We are excited to have him on our team.  As we have reiterated many times, our continued focus on reducing costs and driving efficiencies in order to fund investments and help offset pressures is a key element of our long-term strategy. In September, we announced a new cost reduction and efficiency target of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025. We made good progress against this new goal during the third quarter and plan to provide more detailed annual updates on our Q4 call going forward. In addition to our strong business results, we have continued to make strides toward our goal of becoming one of the best companies to work for in the United States. For example, we have recently added a variety of employee benefits, including paid caregiver leave, paid time off for part-time employees, back up childcare, a PTO purchase plan and enhanced mental health resources. We also increased our adoption assistance benefit and introduced a new surrogacy benefit as part of our efforts to support employees who want to grow their families. And finally, last month we announced an updated dress code that allows employees to wear jeans and comfortable shoes. This is something our store employees have been asking for and importantly, saves them money. These changes have all been extremely well received by our store teams across the country. These are just a few examples of the ways we are continuing to invest in our people and underscore our commitment to be a great place to work and these investments have produced some very positive results. Our store turnover remains in the low 30% range, compared to 50% five years ago and our average store general manager has been in his or her role for about six years. In fact, as we enter Q4, more than 92% of our store general managers already have experience leading their stores through a holiday season. Our progress has also been noticed outside the company. We are proud of the breadth of recognition we have received in recent months, including ranking number 66 on Forbes list of the World\u2019s Best Employers and being named the number one Best Company to Work For during the holiday season by Glassdoor. We are also honored to be ranked one of the top employers for students and graduates of historically black colleges and universities. Our culture at Best Buy is incredibly strong. It\u2019s the reason I am here and I firmly believe it is our competitive advantage.  As we look ahead, we are excited about our holiday plans and everything we have to offer our customers this holiday season. Our team has once again put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability across all the product categories we carry, and we are supporting that work with a steady drum beat of marketing and promotions that will keep Best Buy top of mind with shoppers throughout the holiday season. Earlier this month, we released our Black Friday ad full of thousands of deals on the hottest tech. Hundreds of those deals were available immediately and we will continue to provide compelling offers throughout the holiday season. On the fulfillment side, we are making it even easier and much faster for customers this year. We are promising free next day delivery on thousands of items all season long with no membership or minimum purchase required. The fact that we are able to make that promise to our customers is a huge testament to all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation. About 99% of our customers now live in a ZIP code where next day delivery is available, up from 80% last quarter and if a customer lives in an area where free next day delivery isn\u2019t available or they are shopping for an item that isn\u2019t eligible for it, they can still get free standard shipping. As we have shared previously, we also offer same day delivery on thousands of items in 42 markets, and of course, store pick-up remains a fast and convenient option for our customers. More than 70% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Best Buy store and we promise that their items will be ready within one hour of placing an order. And on average 80% of online orders are ready for store pick-up in less than 30 minutes. The NPS store for the experience continues to increase about 40% of our online sales are pick-up in our stores. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are offering curbside pick-up in a few stores in New York and other select markets across the country allowing customers to pick-up their without even getting out of the car. Our fulfillment options are all focused on providing customers with the choice and convenience they expect and deserve, and with the digital shopping experience on the Best Buy mobile app, it is now easy and intuitive to see your options for when and where you can get your order whether you opt for delivery or store pick-up. I also want to highlight that once again, this year we are supporting the St. Jude Thanksgiving campaign with customer and employee donations in our stores and online. We have been the program\u2019s top fundraising partner for three consecutive years, helping to raise $80 million for St. Jude\u2019s lifesaving work since we first partnered in 2013. We hope to bring that cumulative total to more than $100 million with this holiday season. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the third quarter and our teams are excited and ready to deliver an outstanding holiday season. I want to take a moment to genuinely thank our amazing Best Buy employees in advance for all their hard work this week and throughout the holidays, whether you work in one of our stores, spend your time making house calls to our customers\u2019 homes or work in a distribution center or the corporate office, please know that you are a critical part of what makes Best Buy so special. The holidays can be a fun and very busy time in retail and I want you to know how much we sincerely appreciate all that you do. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $9.76 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better than expected top line results in the computing category and a bit softer than planned in the home theater category. Our operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was primarily driven by strong expense management, which was partially offset by a lower gross profit rate than expected. Consistent with our expectations heading into the quarter, recently implemented tariffs on imported goods from China did not have a material impact on our Q3 results. From an international standpoint, we generated slightly higher operating income than we expected despite our top line results being below expectations. Lastly, the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.8% to $9.76 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.7%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 22% to $1.13. This increase was driven by, one, increased operating income dollars from both a higher operating income rate and higher revenue, and two, a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. These favorable items were partially offset by a negative $0.03 per share impact from a higher effective tax rate. In our Domestic segment, the revenue increased 2.4% to $8.96 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2% from revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October of 2018, partially offset by a loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. GreatCall revenue will be included in our comparable sales calculation the beginning of the start of this year\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both major and small appliances, headphones, tablets and computing. These drivers were partially offset by the clients in our gaming and home theater categories. In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 12.9% versus last year. Similar to the past few quarters, part of the services growth was due to or revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. As a reminder, we will begin to lap this revenue refinement during the years of Q4, so we expect the services year-over-year growth rate to slow materially compared to Q3. Domestic online revenue of $1.4 billion was 15.6% of Domestic revenue, up from 13.8% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 15% on top of 12.6% growth in the third quarter of last year, which was primarily given by a higher average order values. In our International segment, revenue decreased 4.1% to $800 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 170 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise growth profit rate was 24.2% was flat to last year. The Domestic gross profit rate of 24.3% versus 24.4% last year. The 10-basis-point decrease was primarily driven by mix into lower margin products, which was partially offset by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate. International gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 22.5%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin in the services category. Now turning to SG&A, domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.78 billion or 19.9% of revenue versus 20.6% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars decreased $24 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. These favorable items were partially offset by GreatCall operating expenses. International SG&A was $173 million or 21.6% of revenue versus $178 million or 21.3% of revenue last year, a $5 million decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 24.8%, compared to 22.7% last year. The higher rate versus last year was primarily driven by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the prior year. We returned a total of $499 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $368 million and dividends of $131 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $700 million we expect to be in the high side of our target of $750 million to $1 billion in share repurchases this year. Our ending inventory addition was down approximately 7% compared to last year. This decrease is primarily due to a timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which occur a week later this year versus last year. Finally, we are still planning capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Now, I will discuss our outlook. Let me start with a few comments specific to tariffs. As Corie mentioned earlier, the guidance we are providing today continues to include the estimated impacts of all tariffs net of the mitigating actions we are taking. These include, one, bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementations, two, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, three, promotional and pricing strategies, four, sourcing changes, and five, other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors. As a quick reminder, the List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date was September 1st and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smartwatches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. Now back to our outlook. Today, we are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range to reflect the strong Q3 profitability, as well as our improved expectations for Q4. As we shared last quarter, operating income rate expansion in Q3 followed by operating income rate decline in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year. In Q4, we expect a decline in gross profit rate. We expect SG&A rate to be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense. To provide some color on the expected gross profit rate decline, there are three primary drivers all roughly similarly sized. First, we expect a mix of products to have a negative impact on our product margin rates. As I shared last -- on last quarter\u2019s call, this was due in part to giving our teams a little more flexibility to navigate through the holiday season. Second, we anticipate great pressure in our services category, with the largest driver being higher delivery and installation costs. And three -- and third, our outlook, of course, also includes the estimated impacts of all tariffs. One more note on Q4 expected gross profit rate from a sequential point of view. As I reminded you last quarter, we fully lapped the acquisition of GreatCall and the revenue recognition refinement to our Total Tech Support offer in Q4. So they will no longer be a source of gross profit rate expansion as they have been in the last four quarters. Specifically, our guidance for the fourth quarter is Enterprise revenue in the range of $14.75 billion to $15.15 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 3%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.75 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 261 million shares. On a full year basis we are now expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.2 billion to $43.6 billion and Enterprise comparable sales growth of 1% to 2%. Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate slightly up to fiscal 2019\u2019s rate of 4.6%, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.81 to $5.91, which compares to our previous guidance of $5.60 to $5.75. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question over the phone from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Oh! Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I am wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the puts and takes on what would get you to the low versus the high end of the comp guidance range for the year \u2013 or for the fourth quarter. And then kind of looking into what that would imply on the operating margin as well, just some little more color on the puts and takes?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. This is Matt. I will take that question. First, in terms of the revenue guidance range, I think, obviously, holiday is always a special season for consumer electronics. Price and convenience is very important, and like any holiday, we take a very disciplined approach to setting the range, and so what we have set, we feel it\u2019s very appropriate. I think in terms of what we are excited about that could be a good guide, we have a lot of exciting plans and offers and a lot of those includes very strong fulfillment options for our consumers. We still feel like the consumer is relatively strong and the economic indicators are in a good spot. Although, there\u2019s been some -- a little bit of waning of consumer confidence, we still feel like the consumer\u2019s in a good position, so that\u2019s a good thing for us. Sequentially, mobile phones and computing are expected to improve a little bit in Q4. Home theater is also expected to get a little better than it has been on trend. In terms of what could go the other way, I think, obviously, in the holiday period, a lot of other retailers use our category sometimes to drive traffic, so we are thoughtful about thinking about that in our guidance range. Also -- there\u2019s always a possibility of inventory constraints. We don\u2019t see things at this point, but that\u2019s always a possibility. And in terms of gaming, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s been soft all year and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re thoughtful about the range. On the gross profit side, I think, the puts and takes, I think, we talked about what the pressure was in Q4. I think, obviously, as you go through the holiday, you are never quite sure exactly what all the consumers are going to purchase, and the outlet sales mix can sometimes put a little bit of pressure either to the good or to the bad on your margin. Also, to the extent that our services offerings hold and continue to generate some excitement to the holiday, that could be a good guide as well.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just to follow up on the lease to own, you rolled that out to nine new states and any early read on that, maybe percent of customers new versus existing, and then any color on any impact on the comp although I realize it\u2019s still very small?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. I will tell a little bit about lease to own. First, we were going to start in the same place which is this is an offering we think, it is really good for our customers. At Best Buy, we always start with the branded credit card, but now we have another option for people who may not want to get into a credit card offering or may just have a more challenged credit history. We have talked a little bit about that at Investor Day. It is still a relatively small portion of the comp growth that we are seeing, but it is importantly an incremental -- either new or what had been a lapsed customer for us, and so we really like this opportunity to bring that customer back in. We didn\u2019t launch the next nine states -- the new nine states including New York and California until just a couple of weeks ago, was very late into the third quarter. So, we will see how that plays here over the holiday season and into next year. Next year is really where we feel like we have a chance to continue to accelerate our growth here. This is something you can imagine that takes our associates some time to get comfortable with. It\u2019s a different type of offer, and they need to definitely feel like they have good comfort in offering it. And we also continue to improve our experiences, both in-store, the information we ask for. But importantly next year, we want to be able to also offer it online, which would be a great addition for us. So we like it. It\u2019s a good secondary offer, but still relatively small in terms of the overall comp.\nKaren Short: Great. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: You bet.\nOperator: We will now take our next question over the phone from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. So can you talk about the estimated impact on margins from GreatCall and Total Tech Support? It just seems to me those are higher margin businesses. I guess I would have expected maybe a little better gross margin performance just given the growth of those two segments? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. Thank you. I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about how those were both benefits to us for the last four quarters, so they have been helping on the margins. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that from a GreatCall perspective, it increases the margin rate a bit, but it also increases the operating. So from an OI perspective, it\u2019s still relatively neutral. On TTS, what we called out is a specific part to the revenue recognition refinement that we made. Service is a much bigger category. It includes obviously all the other runoff of legacy system, great legacy support offers, as well as installation and delivery and so when you put them together, we try to think of services in totality, and that is not as we talked about, it is a pressure in Q4. So, that\u2019s kind of the way to think about those two.\nScot Ciccarelli: I guess I was looking for any kind of quantification, but are you -- but basically the way we should think about it is on an EBIT basis it\u2019s pretty similar to the rest of the corporate run rate? Is that what you are saying, no real contribution to the EBIT line?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. The EBIT line it\u2019s pretty -- it\u2019s relatively neutral for both of those two things as you consider all the factors of services into the TTS as well.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the operating profit in the fourth quarter and then a more strategic question. Operating rate should be down in the fourth quarter, but on SG&A dollars, I missed what do you expect is part of that, if it wasn\u2019t for the cycling the incentive comp a year ago. How much would dollars have been up in the third quarter and what would you expect in the fourth quarter?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. We are not going to get specifics on how much dollars would have been without lower incentive compensation. In Q4, we do expect a carry on some strong SG&A management in Q4. So in Q4 the puts and takes are really lower incentive compensation, but we are also investing a little bit in advertising and labor. So it is going to be -- we do expect it to be favorable comparatively but we are not giving specifics on the lower incentives number.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then if we look, overall, I mean, obviously, the comp looks solid. You are driving some categories where maybe we didn\u2019t -- we keep seeing nice growth like appliances. If we were to take the comp in the third quarter and even look into the fourth quarter next year. How much of that comp is driven by average ticket and how much of it is by continued traffic or transaction growth, whether it would be online or in-store?\nCorie Barry: So the wonderful thing about being more omni-channel now is that tends to be how we look at our organic metric where we are looking at all of our metrics together. And what we saw in Q3 was traffic across all our channels was up at as was our average order value. And so those two were up, we thought and total transactions down just a little bit, but broadly like the health we are seeing in broad traffic up and those order value is up as well.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. And then a last one on just tariffs, I want to make sure I am clear that we are talking -- we talk about List 4. Do you assume that the 15% is going to happen in December or is it just not material because it\u2019s so late in the quarter?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. It\u2019s a little bit of both. We are assuming\u2026\nGreg Melich: Okay.\nCorie Barry: \u2026that that goes in at the 15th, and at the same time, it\u2019s not very -- that portion, that tranche is not very material on the quarter. That tranche becomes more of a conversation piece for next year.\nGreg Melich: That\u2019s great. Well, happy holidays, and good luck, guys.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt McClintock: Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Corie, I wanted to dig into IHA a little bit. You talked about hiring an additional 100 IHAs this quarter, but then you also talked about putting in an accelerated training program for IHAs and it seems like you are building out an infrastructure to maybe meaningfully accelerate the number of IHAs that you have. Can you just dig into that a little bit, am I reading that right? Can you talk more to that? Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Well, I think -- thank you for the question. I think since day one we have said our focus here is on making the very best in-home experience we can seamlessly across all the ways that we interact with people in their homes. And we said repeatedly over the last couple of years, we are going to take our time pacing this, because we definitely want to ensure creating clienteling at scale is not an easy task and we want to do everything we can to make sure we exceed the customer\u2019s expectations if we get a chance to be in their home. I think some of what we have learned around how best to train is now being translated into to your point a bit of a different approach to training. It used to be when we pulled someone on Board we would use other IHAs to a very large extent to really help them understand what was expected of them, how to build a base of business and how to continue to build their clienteling. I think what we have done better now is created a much more standardized training program upfront that we can administer and allows the existing IHAs to continue to build a more robust clienteling capability while we are bringing new IHAs up to speed and getting them ready and working quickly. And so, I think, the team is learning a lot about how best to bring people on, what you train them in first, how to take your more experienced IHAs and put them against some of the more complex jobs. All of those are turning -- helping us continue to refine the IHA model. So to your point, I don\u2019t know if I would say it\u2019s just accelerated as much as us continuing to take the learning and pace where we think is appropriate based on the demand we are seeing. Importantly, I would also underscore the example that we gave in the New York market, which is we also think there are specific markets where this offering could be and should be even more relevant than others. When you look at the data about how people want to interact with us, how they want help in their homes, we think we uniquely have a really interesting opportunity to help people in their homes in these markets, and therefore, our ramping and training a little bit differently for some of these markets.\nMatt McClintock: Thanks for that color. And then just as a follow-up, you talked a lot about your next day same day fulfillment and how you have improved that year-over-year. How do you look at that strategically for the fourth quarter, specifically this holiday season, given that it\u2019s a shorter holiday season? And how does that compare competitively to other people that sell your products, clearly some of your peers have those options, but for the breadth of product that you sell, it would seem like a lot of your pet competitors just can\u2019t match that?\nMike Mohan: Hey, Matt. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. I will start with the last part. We feel really good about how we are positioned competitively. Our teams there just call it two-thirds the way through our supply chain transformation and the progress we have seen to-date and the customer response has been fantastic. And we look at all aspects of what the customers see on our site versus competitors and what we are able to deliver. I think what makes it unique at Best Buy is a combination of automation we put in our large facilities, the metro e-commerce facilities that we added to some of our major markets. And then we have been doing in-store fulfillment both in-store pick-up and ship from store, longer than anybody else. And I think we have found ways to refine that so we can actually deliver on promises on the products that people want the most, so these high value consumer electronic items and depending on where you live in the country, we are just as good as anybody at getting you stuff right away. You can come to our stores or you can get stuff the very next day. And what complements that, I think, that has to be said, as you have got to be in stock on these items too, and I think, that\u2019s something that our teams have proven expertise in. And so you put those all together and that\u2019s what lets us deliver on we think a very compelling fulfillment promise, one that doesn\u2019t cost us a lot of extra money, because of the investments we have made and it\u2019s something that, Matt, talked about in his remarks, we are going to lead into help drive the comp in our fourth quarter.\nMatt McClintock: Thanks a lot, Mike. Best of luck everyone. \nCorie Barry: Thank you. \nMike Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Feldman: Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to go back to inventory for a moment. You had mentioned you knew it was down timing related to the holiday, but how should we think about it for the fourth quarter, presumably you have brought in a lot more at this point. But just what type of rate of increase should we expect for the fourth quarter if any?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. This is Matt. I think we are not going to get the rate of increase at the end of the year at this point, but I think the teams are feeling very well-positioned for the holiday week. Like I said, we had a lower inventory position at the end of Q3 simply because of the holiday shift in timing of being a week a little -- a week later this year. The teams will do what they need to do to be in a good position. I think we are always very thoughtful about bringing in the right amount and how much of that is owned versus not. So I think we are not going to give a specific amount, but I would expect us to continue to match that with the pace of sales that we expect as we head into next year.\nJoe Feldman: Thanks. And then just to get more specific on appliances, can you talk about what continues to drive the strength there? I mean, are you -- presumably you guys are taking some market share. I am wondering where you think that\u2019s coming from, but also just what is driving such good strength on top of prior strength?\nMike Mohan: Joe, it\u2019s Mike. I will amplify a bit of the fulfillment comments to Matt. That\u2019s part of the reason why we have improved our appliance business with the investments we have made in fulfillment. It wasn\u2019t just speed and small parcel, and leveraging our store network. It was our large product delivery and how we built support with our own teams and with partners and we have make sure we improved that. And it\u2019s complemented with the investments we have made in training, marketing, the in-store experience and we thought about this category end-to-end. And as I think most of you know is, a large percentage of appliance purchases happen with something that you don\u2019t expect occurs, an appliance in your house breaks. And frankly a few years ago we just weren\u2019t very good at that and we have made some really big improvements on how we can help customers navigate for items they can get a very next day, for things they can take with them from our stores, and then we continue the reinforcement with our in-home advisors the ability to help sell appliances when we are in your homes and continue to expand our assortment. So it\u2019s a suite of investments across the Board that helped drive this. And as you know, we are now on our eighth year and counting on consecutive comp growth and we have been awarded JD Powers top honors third year in appliances and we like the category a lot and we like the customer response to what we are doing right now.\nJoe Feldman: Great. Thanks. Good luck with the holiday period.\nCorie Barry: Thank you. \nMike Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. So some retailers have called out lengthened purchase decision cycles resulting from tariff-driven price increases. From the strength of your comp, I\u2019d imagine you are not, but maybe just comment on that and speak to how consumers maybe digesting some of the selected price increases you have instituted and whether you are making an expectation for greater elasticity in 4Q? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: This one is so difficult and we talked about before there just really isn\u2019t a precedent for where we are right now and there are a lot of moving pieces. And as you can imagine, both our teams and our vendors are employing a number of strategies. In the third quarter specifically, we definitely saw a limited number of small price increases. And if you look at the items that were on the list on 4A things like TVs, and especially, some of the smaller screen size. I think in general what\u2019s difficult, though, is that you now have quite a few items that are on any of the less than elasticities for any given individual item are incredibly difficult. And in fact, I think, it\u2019s even more difficult as you head into Q4, which is a highly promotional season and we will be less about whether or not there\u2019s a tariff on any individual item, it will be about promotional positioning throughout the quarter. And so I give our teams a great deal of credit for pretty carefully navigating thus far and to have really good plans into Q4 and we are seeing a variety of mitigation tactics go into place. We talked about this last time we had the call, obviously, we are thinking about where we assort and who we assort, definitely we are seeing promotional decisions being made by every single retailer out there as we head into this period. Obviously some of these are global vendors and they are thinking about how they move their supply chain, what pieces and parts they put into and how they decide to structure any of their different assemblies and we are already seeing some of the manufacturing move. And so, yes, we saw a little bit of impact into Q3, but as Matt said, it wasn\u2019t material enough for us to quantify our call out. Q4 I think is all about price and promotion, and how you are positioning, and we will see how this evolves as we head into next year.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just you mentioned some exciting new kind of fulfillment options in kind of the New York City area. So just help us think about what\u2019s the timeframe as you think about maybe rolling out some of those options elsewhere in the country?\nMike Mohan: Yeah. Jonathan, it\u2019s Mike. New York is a great place for us to start primarily because of the density of consumers and our sheer lack of stores in some of the areas we would like to support customers and where we see opportunities from alternative pick-up locations and curbside. Those are primarily the two things we launched in New York first. We see an opportunity to scale those both nationally as we get past this holiday because there clearly things that add value to the shopping experience at Best Buy and that\u2019s something that we think we can do. So it\u2019s a great question. Thank you for asking it.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So one was a thought about, as we think about next year, it looks like you guys are putting up pretty strong comps even though there\u2019s really not a product cycle going on at least that\u2019s my thought. And as we get into next year, it seems like you would have a number of drivers as we get 8K TVs coming down in price, we get a 5G iPhone, and we have two new gaming consoles. So how are you guys thinking about this year versus next year and are my thoughts right?\nCorie Barry: So, obviously, we are not going to guide for next year yet. But I think what we like about this year is it underscores what has been our strategic point of view and that is people want and need electronics and those are going to continue to evolve over time and we have a very unique offering digitally in our stores and in-home that will help people make the best decisions and keep their products working.  As we head into next year, there\u2019s obviously some things to be excited about. And counter point to that or at least something else to consider is the ongoing impact of tariffs potentially as we head into next year. So what the teams are doing right now as you can imagine is working through all of that, all the mitigation strategies that I just talked about and thinking about how we can put together the right suite of offers and experiences for our customers next year. I think no matter what, we feel like strategically we are positioned in the right way to capitalize on and commercialize new technology, which consistently we are able to do in a way that is very unique in the marketplace.\nScott Mushkin: Great. And then my second question actually is, I guess, more strategic, obviously, you guys have been active, somewhat active in M&A with GreatCall and others that you have done. As you look at interconnected home more broadly, Corie, is there more you can do here as we look out rather very pointed at healthcare right now, but it seems like there\u2019s a huge market and huge opportunity especially as you layer in 5G capabilities?\nCorie Barry: It\u2019s interesting. We don\u2019t talk about it as much or talk about the M&A in it as much, but if you go into our stores, almost every what we would commercially refer to as department is connected to the next one or could be connected to the next one. And our associates are uniquely well-suited to help people navigate through the compatibility or the ability for people to connect broadly in their homes. 5G we have talked about it, it\u2019s going to be a slow roll. It\u2019s going to be market by market. But we have also said, we think there will be some interesting product innovation and that we again uniquely are able to help the consumer through what\u2019s available specifically for them in their market and how could it show up for them in their home in a very seamless and integrated way. And I think, you will see and you have seen the stores continue to evolve in ways that highlight that interconnected capability. And I think, again, our team will, obviously, capitalize on that ability to commercialize any new technology, excuse me, that\u2019s coming down the pipe that will help capitalize on 5G and just processing and information power that will provide.\nMatt Bilunas: Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nZack Fadem: Hey. Good morning. Can you walk us through your view of the impact of some of the Q4 headwinds around six fewer selling days? And then the Intel supply issues and to what extent you have incorporated these items in your outlook?\nCorie Barry: So first on the holiday selling season, every bit of consumer data would say consumers are starting earlier in the hopes that they actually can finish earlier. We don\u2019t ever know exactly how that plays out for them, but that is every bit of consumer data that we are seeing. And I think every bit of data that we have seen certainly over the last five years is that the promotional cycle continues to pull earlier and earlier, and that more and more people are launching ads and deals earlier and earlier. Additionally, the fulfillment options that are available to people have completely changed the competitive landscape in terms of how quickly you can get your items with next day, same day, in-store pick-up, all of these being available and we feel particularly strategically relevant for us with our physical locations, our ability to be in your home, our next day available to 99% of the ZIP codes this really suits us well. And so our point of view is that the less days is much less relevant than it used to be historically and that you are going to capture that demand slightly differently, but that demand is coming. We like to joke and say there\u2019s still the same number of days between Halloween and Christmas, and so we feel like shoppers are going to meet their needs the way that they want given all the fulfillment options. In terms of the Intel news, our team would say they feel very well-equipped for holidays and that we have the right products. We have -- Matt talked about inventory, very good inventory levels, lots of availability both in our stores and online. And then we will continue to work on that issue as we head into the next year. And I would argue our merchants are very good at navigating situations like this and are working towards the impacts for next year.\nZack Fadem: Got it. Thanks, Corie. And then on the gaming category weakness, curious if you could expand on that in a little more detail whether you think it\u2019s primary -- primarily innovation driven or if there\u2019s something structural there. Just curious on your thoughts on when the category could turn around?\nMike Mohan: Yeah. Zack, it\u2019s Mike. I think, the gaming category still is exciting. We think about it broad -- more broadly than just the console category based on what we think and where consumers are looking for experiences to be enhanced. Obviously we are on the year cycle of new devices coming out next holiday. So you have got kind of the best of both worlds for consumers thinking about what they want to do and thinking now -- between now and next holiday what they are feeling. So we have talked about gaming not being a driver for our business and we are seeing that reflect ourselves in the result. But also the category is promotional and drives good footsteps. And clearly this holiday you can see by what we are promoting. There\u2019s some exciting offers and there\u2019s still demand for that. Just at lower price points than they historically have been. I think there\u2019s a sizeable shift and it will be for the foreseeable future how software compliments the experience and we have seen that for some time. So the consumer wants to move into higher power costs of devices more connected as it plays really good to our strengths on getting the right devices and the right accessories to meet the solution. And we think it will still be a great category for us as we move forward.\nZack Fadem: Got it. I appreciate that. Thanks so much. \nCorie Barry: Thank you. \nMike Mohan: Thank you. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what drove the improvements in the computing category relative to the prior trend, it seems like that perked up which is great for your business. And then as you look to the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about that category and what drives the expected improvement in home theater?\nMike Mohan: Yeah. Chris, it\u2019s Mike. I will start and then, Corie, and Matt, can just chime in. We don\u2019t segment our selling seasons interdependent of our quarters, but we came out of period argues are really strong back-to-school season for Best Buy. Corie talked about in your remarks about the evolution of our weekly ad to Top Deals, which lets us to be more flexible and how we offer deals to everybody that greatly benefited our back-to-school program with our ability to offer students more directly. We focused on a new marketing segment and went for a younger demographic with where we placed our media. And our team is, we already talked about briefly as they do a fantastic job of finding the right value propositions to get things in play and then get a handful of new products shipped during the quarter, which was excellent and we did a superb job on offering pre-orders and an ability to get rid of your old devices. And so when I look at that for Q3 it plays itself going into Q4 quite well and we are seeing great demand on our holiday products right now, we see no reason why it won\u2019t continue, and so we feel good about that experience. We have been investing in for years continues to pay dividends for us. Corie, would you add anything?\nCorie Barry: No. I would just underscore, I think, this is a place where the team\u2019s done a great job every computer that you could want to look at, feel and touch and get help with is available. And in spaces like now where there\u2019s clearly interest on processing power, interest in high-end tablets, interest in computing, we are just very well-positioned to capitalize on that. So thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you in our Q4 call in February, and we all hope -- we hope that you all have a safe and very happy holidays. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $9.76 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better than expected top line results in the computing category and a bit softer than planned in the home theater category. Our operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was primarily driven by strong expense management, which was partially offset by a lower gross profit rate than expected. Consistent with our expectations heading into the quarter, recently implemented tariffs on imported goods from China did not have a material impact on our Q3 results. From an international standpoint, we generated slightly higher operating income than we expected despite our top line results being below expectations. Lastly, the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.8% to $9.76 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.7%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 22% to $1.13. This increase was driven by, one, increased operating income dollars from both a higher operating income rate and higher revenue, and two, a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. These favorable items were partially offset by a negative $0.03 per share impact from a higher effective tax rate. In our Domestic segment, the revenue increased 2.4% to $8.96 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2% from revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October of 2018, partially offset by a loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. GreatCall revenue will be included in our comparable sales calculation the beginning of the start of this year's fiscal fourth quarter. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both major and small appliances, headphones, tablets and computing. These drivers were partially offset by the clients in our gaming and home theater categories. In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 12.9% versus last year. Similar to the past few quarters, part of the services growth was due to or revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. As a reminder, we will begin to lap this revenue refinement during the years of Q4, so we expect the services year-over-year growth rate to slow materially compared to Q3. Domestic online revenue of $1.4 billion was 15.6% of Domestic revenue, up from 13.8% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 15% on top of 12.6% growth in the third quarter of last year, which was primarily given by a higher average order values. In our International segment, revenue decreased 4.1% to $800 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 170 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise growth profit rate was 24.2% was flat to last year. The Domestic gross profit rate of 24.3% versus 24.4% last year. The 10-basis-point decrease was primarily driven by mix into lower margin products, which was partially offset by the impact of GreatCall's higher gross profit rate. International gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 22.5%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin in the services category. Now turning to SG&A, domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.78 billion or 19.9% of revenue versus 20.6% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars decreased $24 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. These favorable items were partially offset by GreatCall operating expenses. International SG&A was $173 million or 21.6% of revenue versus $178 million or 21.3% of revenue last year, a $5 million decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 24.8%, compared to 22.7% last year. The higher rate versus last year was primarily driven by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the prior year. We returned a total of $499 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $368 million and dividends of $131 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $700 million we expect to be in the high side of our target of $750 million to $1 billion in share repurchases this year. Our ending inventory addition was down approximately 7% compared to last year. This decrease is primarily due to a timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which occur a week later this year versus last year. Finally, we are still planning capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Now, I will discuss our outlook. Let me start with a few comments specific to tariffs. As Corie mentioned earlier, the guidance we are providing today continues to include the estimated impacts of all tariffs net of the mitigating actions we are taking. These include, one, bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementations, two, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, three, promotional and pricing strategies, four, sourcing changes, and five, other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors. As a quick reminder, the List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date was September 1st and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smartwatches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. Now back to our outlook. Today, we are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range to reflect the strong Q3 profitability, as well as our improved expectations for Q4. As we shared last quarter, operating income rate expansion in Q3 followed by operating income rate decline in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year. In Q4, we expect a decline in gross profit rate. We expect SG&A rate to be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense. To provide some color on the expected gross profit rate decline, there are three primary drivers all roughly similarly sized. First, we expect a mix of products to have a negative impact on our product margin rates. As I shared last -- on last quarter's call, this was due in part to giving our teams a little more flexibility to navigate through the holiday season. Second, we anticipate great pressure in our services category, with the largest driver being higher delivery and installation costs. And three -- and third, our outlook, of course, also includes the estimated impacts of all tariffs. One more note on Q4 expected gross profit rate from a sequential point of view. As I reminded you last quarter, we fully lapped the acquisition of GreatCall and the revenue recognition refinement to our Total Tech Support offer in Q4. So they will no longer be a source of gross profit rate expansion as they have been in the last four quarters. Specifically, our guidance for the fourth quarter is Enterprise revenue in the range of $14.75 billion to $15.15 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 3%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.75 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 261 million shares. On a full year basis we are now expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.2 billion to $43.6 billion and Enterprise comparable sales growth of 1% to 2%. Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate slightly up to fiscal 2019's rate of 4.6%, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.81 to $5.91, which compares to our previous guidance of $5.60 to $5.75. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Sure. This is Matt. I will take that question. First, in terms of the revenue guidance range, I think, obviously, holiday is always a special season for consumer electronics. Price and convenience is very important, and like any holiday, we take a very disciplined approach to setting the range, and so what we have set, we feel it's very appropriate. I think in terms of what we are excited about that could be a good guide, we have a lot of exciting plans and offers and a lot of those includes very strong fulfillment options for our consumers. We still feel like the consumer is relatively strong and the economic indicators are in a good spot. Although, there's been some -- a little bit of waning of consumer confidence, we still feel like the consumer's in a good position, so that's a good thing for us. Sequentially, mobile phones and computing are expected to improve a little bit in Q4. Home theater is also expected to get a little better than it has been on trend. In terms of what could go the other way, I think, obviously, in the holiday period, a lot of other retailers use our category sometimes to drive traffic, so we are thoughtful about thinking about that in our guidance range. Also -- there's always a possibility of inventory constraints. We don't see things at this point, but that's always a possibility. And in terms of gaming, that's -- it's been soft all year and that's something that we're thoughtful about the range. On the gross profit side, I think, the puts and takes, I think, we talked about what the pressure was in Q4. I think, obviously, as you go through the holiday, you are never quite sure exactly what all the consumers are going to purchase, and the outlet sales mix can sometimes put a little bit of pressure either to the good or to the bad on your margin. Also, to the extent that our services offerings hold and continue to generate some excitement to the holiday, that could be a good guide as well. Yeah. Thank you. I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about how those were both benefits to us for the last four quarters, so they have been helping on the margins. And I think it's important to remember that from a GreatCall perspective, it increases the margin rate a bit, but it also increases the operating. So from an OI perspective, it's still relatively neutral. On TTS, what we called out is a specific part to the revenue recognition refinement that we made. Service is a much bigger category. It includes obviously all the other runoff of legacy system, great legacy support offers, as well as installation and delivery and so when you put them together, we try to think of services in totality, and that is not as we talked about, it is a pressure in Q4. So, that's kind of the way to think about those two. Yeah. The EBIT line it's pretty -- it's relatively neutral for both of those two things as you consider all the factors of services into the TTS as well. Yeah. We are not going to get specifics on how much dollars would have been without lower incentive compensation. In Q4, we do expect a carry on some strong SG&A management in Q4. So in Q4 the puts and takes are really lower incentive compensation, but we are also investing a little bit in advertising and labor. So it is going to be -- we do expect it to be favorable comparatively but we are not giving specifics on the lower incentives number. Sure. This is Matt. I think we are not going to get the rate of increase at the end of the year at this point, but I think the teams are feeling very well-positioned for the holiday week. Like I said, we had a lower inventory position at the end of Q3 simply because of the holiday shift in timing of being a week a little -- a week later this year. The teams will do what they need to do to be in a good position. I think we are always very thoughtful about bringing in the right amount and how much of that is owned versus not. So I think we are not going to give a specific amount, but I would expect us to continue to match that with the pace of sales that we expect as we head into next year. Next question, please?"

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we have reported $9.76 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.13, which was up 22% compared to the third quarter of last year. We delivered another strong quarter and are excited about our continued momentum and the opportunities we have ahead of us. Our teams continued to execute well and navigate ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment, and the uncertain tariff situation. And they are doing all this while making significant progress against our Building the New Blue strategy, which we believe will uniquely position us over the long-term. Specifically, our comparable sales growth of 1.7% was on top of 4.3% last year and above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our Domestic segment comparable sales were up 2%, as we continue to focus on the customer experience across online, stores, and at home. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in appliances, headphones, tablets, and computing, partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. The Q3 profitability was better-than-expected. This was primarily the result of lower SG&A, due to strong expense management, a reflection of the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. The Q3 gross profit rate was flat on a year-over-year basis. Due to the strong Q3 results, we are updating our annual guidance today. Matt will discuss in more detail later in the call, but at a high level we are maintaining the topline guidance we shared last quarter, while raising the non-GAAP EPS guidance. We are now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.81 to $5.91. This compares to the original guidance of $5.45 to $5.65 that we provided last February as we entered the year. As it relates to tariffs, our assumptions of the impact on our business are basically unchanged from our last call. As a reminder, our guidance includes our best estimate of the impact of all tariffs, both implemented and planned, including List 3 at 25%, List 4A at 15%, which was implemented on September 1, and List 4B at 15% which is planned for December 15. As we shared at our Investor Update in September, we are entering the second chapter of Building the New Blue. Our purpose remains the same: to enrich lives through technology. Our strategy is to leverage our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs, and build more and deeper relationships with our customers. We introduced three five-year goals at our Investor Update focused on employees, customers, and financials. As a reminder, they are: first, to be one of the best companies to work for in the U.S., exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Second, to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services, and senior life support. And third, to deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal 2025. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time. Last quarter, we talked about how our penetration by geographic market varies widely, yet our tools and structure have been one-size-fits-all for our local markets. To better serve existing customers, we made strategic changes to our field operations to accelerate growth and to create a more seamless experience across channels, putting single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain, and home propositions in their market. These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights, data, and analytics, to view market's largest opportunities and fast-track initiatives that will make a financial impact as well as provide a more seamless customer experience. For example, in the New York area, we are focused on expanding both our fulfillment options and in-home resources. During the quarter, we launched 175 alternate pickup locations for customers in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship-to-home option is not desired. These alternate locations are in UPS stores and CVS stores in the New York market. In New York, as well as Los Angeles and Chicago, online customers can order as late as 8 p.m. and still receive their products the next day for free. Starting in New York, we are also adding the ability for online customers who want their product the same day to select specific three-hour delivery window for that same day delivery. And for those online customers who prefer to pick up the products themselves, we are beginning the process of rolling out curbside pickup at stores in the New York market, where a Best Buy employee will bring the product directly to the customer's car. To build awareness of these expanded experiences, we have already kicked off a comprehensive local market marketing campaign that includes stores, train stations, billboards, digital, and email. Based on our data, we believe there is much untapped opportunity to serve New York clients in their homes. To capitalize on that opportunity, we are building capacity by adding additional in-home advisors and also increasing the training for existing advisors. We have combined additional resources from both the field and corporate teams to provide these new advisors an accelerated, locally focused training program that we believe will speed up their ramp-up time. This will free up capacity for our existing advisors in the market to receive more training designed to strengthen their clienteling skills, which will lead to deeper customer relationships. Based on local market analysis, we have also added capacity across the country where we continue to see strong customer demand for our in-home consultation program. On a national level during the quarter we added 100 in-home advisors to end the quarter with approximately 720 advisors. As we shared at our Investor Updates, 95% of those polled said they would continue working with their in-home advisor and we continue to see higher spend at a higher gross profit rates from our in-home advisor customers versus other customers. We expect our advisors will become more and more productive as we advance our CRM system and enhance our digital tools. Another important way we are better serving customers and building relationships is through our Total Tech Support program. Total Tech Support provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all of their technology no matter where or when they bought it, in addition to great discounts and installations, protection and in-home services. We have grown the membership to over 2 million members from about 200,000 when we launched nationally in May of last year. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice as likely to use other services than non-members. We are building on this early success to continue to deliver more benefits our members are asking for. For example, we are piloting a program, we are calling Total Tech Support with networking that includes routers setup and installation, parental controls to manage every device on the network, a subscription to Microsoft Office 365, and 1 terabyte of cloud storage along with all the standard Total Tech Support benefits. We are also continuing to add new services and capabilities that have the potential to attract new customers. As we shared last quarter, Best Buy is now fully certified chain wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation's largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services including same day iPhone repairs. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven't made a purchase in the last year. Our lease to own purchasing option is now fully rolled out in 45 states after we added the last nine states including California and New York just a few weeks ago. This provides another purchasing option in addition to our existing strong credit card offer allowing us to help customers make purchases they might not otherwise be able to. Since we began rolling out the program nationally in March, approximately 65% of lease to own customers are either new to Best Buy or haven't made a purchase in the last year. We also remain focused on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. We continue to enhance our digital shopping platforms both online and on our mobile app, with new functionality and a better customer experience. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and year-to-date usage of the app is up more than 20%, and usage of our app within our stores is up more than 30%. Our store employees love the app, which has also been improved with their needs in mind. They can now much more quickly see pricing, promotions, inventory and fulfillment times, through features such as Top Deals, which I will discuss in a moment, and expanded availability options. The app also provides employees other recommended products if a certain product is out of stock in their store. During the quarter, we materially changed the way we present product deals to our customers. Several years ago, we created a digital version of our weekly ad as we transitioned away from the paper weekly ad that was distributed every Sunday. We no longer distribute any paper weekly ads, and during Q3, we sun-setted the rigid digital weekly ad technology platform and launched a Top Deals section in our app and on our website. This leverages cost and gives us more flexibility to introduce multiple promotional cycles within the week and ensure we featuring our best offers. Most importantly, Top Deals provides a better user experience and helps customers find products faster with fewer clicks, resulting in higher and more consistent traffic throughout the week and better conversion compared to the old experience. At our Investor Update in September, we also spent time talking about the significant opportunity we see in the health space. Specifically, we have reiterated our focus on helping seniors live longer in their homes through our unique combination of tap and touch, thereby reducing their health care costs and bringing greater peace of mind for them and their families and caregivers. We serve approximately 1 million seniors right now and we shared our goal to serve 5 million seniors in fiscal 2025. Today, most of the seniors we serve are utilizing easy-to-use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. With our five star service, customers can talk to U.S. based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. We expect to continue to scale this business over time in order to reach our five-year target. We also expect to advance our commercial business where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by insurance providers. This includes services such as remote monitoring based solutions that provide meaningful insights to improve timely care and reduce the cost to serve frail seniors. As previously discussed, we have successfully closed and integrated three acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We have also hired additional talent to deepen our expertise. That includes Dr. Daniel Grossman, our new Chief Medical Officer for Best Buy Health. He is a practicing emergency medicine physician at a major academic medical center in Rochester, Minnesota, with extensive strategy and business development experiences at leading health tech companies. He has been on all sides of health care, physicians, patients, payer, disrupter and educator. We are excited to have him on our team.  As we have reiterated many times, our continued focus on reducing costs and driving efficiencies in order to fund investments and help offset pressures is a key element of our long-term strategy. In September, we announced a new cost reduction and efficiency target of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025. We made good progress against this new goal during the third quarter and plan to provide more detailed annual updates on our Q4 call going forward. In addition to our strong business results, we have continued to make strides toward our goal of becoming one of the best companies to work for in the United States. For example, we have recently added a variety of employee benefits, including paid caregiver leave, paid time off for part-time employees, back up childcare, a PTO purchase plan and enhanced mental health resources. We also increased our adoption assistance benefit and introduced a new surrogacy benefit as part of our efforts to support employees who want to grow their families. And finally, last month we announced an updated dress code that allows employees to wear jeans and comfortable shoes. This is something our store employees have been asking for and importantly, saves them money. These changes have all been extremely well received by our store teams across the country. These are just a few examples of the ways we are continuing to invest in our people and underscore our commitment to be a great place to work and these investments have produced some very positive results. Our store turnover remains in the low 30% range, compared to 50% five years ago and our average store general manager has been in his or her role for about six years. In fact, as we enter Q4, more than 92% of our store general managers already have experience leading their stores through a holiday season. Our progress has also been noticed outside the company. We are proud of the breadth of recognition we have received in recent months, including ranking number 66 on Forbes list of the World's Best Employers and being named the number one Best Company to Work For during the holiday season by Glassdoor. We are also honored to be ranked one of the top employers for students and graduates of historically black colleges and universities. Our culture at Best Buy is incredibly strong. It's the reason I am here and I firmly believe it is our competitive advantage.  As we look ahead, we are excited about our holiday plans and everything we have to offer our customers this holiday season. Our team has once again put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability across all the product categories we carry, and we are supporting that work with a steady drum beat of marketing and promotions that will keep Best Buy top of mind with shoppers throughout the holiday season. Earlier this month, we released our Black Friday ad full of thousands of deals on the hottest tech. Hundreds of those deals were available immediately and we will continue to provide compelling offers throughout the holiday season. On the fulfillment side, we are making it even easier and much faster for customers this year. We are promising free next day delivery on thousands of items all season long with no membership or minimum purchase required. The fact that we are able to make that promise to our customers is a huge testament to all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation. About 99% of our customers now live in a ZIP code where next day delivery is available, up from 80% last quarter and if a customer lives in an area where free next day delivery isn't available or they are shopping for an item that isn't eligible for it, they can still get free standard shipping. As we have shared previously, we also offer same day delivery on thousands of items in 42 markets, and of course, store pick-up remains a fast and convenient option for our customers. More than 70% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Best Buy store and we promise that their items will be ready within one hour of placing an order. And on average 80% of online orders are ready for store pick-up in less than 30 minutes. The NPS store for the experience continues to increase about 40% of our online sales are pick-up in our stores. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are offering curbside pick-up in a few stores in New York and other select markets across the country allowing customers to pick-up their without even getting out of the car. Our fulfillment options are all focused on providing customers with the choice and convenience they expect and deserve, and with the digital shopping experience on the Best Buy mobile app, it is now easy and intuitive to see your options for when and where you can get your order whether you opt for delivery or store pick-up. I also want to highlight that once again, this year we are supporting the St. Jude Thanksgiving campaign with customer and employee donations in our stores and online. We have been the program's top fundraising partner for three consecutive years, helping to raise $80 million for St. Jude's lifesaving work since we first partnered in 2013. We hope to bring that cumulative total to more than $100 million with this holiday season. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the third quarter and our teams are excited and ready to deliver an outstanding holiday season. I want to take a moment to genuinely thank our amazing Best Buy employees in advance for all their hard work this week and throughout the holidays, whether you work in one of our stores, spend your time making house calls to our customers' homes or work in a distribution center or the corporate office, please know that you are a critical part of what makes Best Buy so special. The holidays can be a fun and very busy time in retail and I want you to know how much we sincerely appreciate all that you do. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt. Yeah. I will tell a little bit about lease to own. First, we were going to start in the same place which is this is an offering we think, it is really good for our customers. At Best Buy, we always start with the branded credit card, but now we have another option for people who may not want to get into a credit card offering or may just have a more challenged credit history. We have talked a little bit about that at Investor Day. It is still a relatively small portion of the comp growth that we are seeing, but it is importantly an incremental -- either new or what had been a lapsed customer for us, and so we really like this opportunity to bring that customer back in. We didn't launch the next nine states -- the new nine states including New York and California until just a couple of weeks ago, was very late into the third quarter. So, we will see how that plays here over the holiday season and into next year. Next year is really where we feel like we have a chance to continue to accelerate our growth here. This is something you can imagine that takes our associates some time to get comfortable with. It's a different type of offer, and they need to definitely feel like they have good comfort in offering it. And we also continue to improve our experiences, both in-store, the information we ask for. But importantly next year, we want to be able to also offer it online, which would be a great addition for us. So we like it. It's a good secondary offer, but still relatively small in terms of the overall comp. You bet. So the wonderful thing about being more omni-channel now is that tends to be how we look at our organic metric where we are looking at all of our metrics together. And what we saw in Q3 was traffic across all our channels was up at as was our average order value. And so those two were up, we thought and total transactions down just a little bit, but broadly like the health we are seeing in broad traffic up and those order value is up as well. Yeah. It's a little bit of both. We are assuming... ...that that goes in at the 15th, and at the same time, it's not very -- that portion, that tranche is not very material on the quarter. That tranche becomes more of a conversation piece for next year. Thank you. Well, I think -- thank you for the question. I think since day one we have said our focus here is on making the very best in-home experience we can seamlessly across all the ways that we interact with people in their homes. And we said repeatedly over the last couple of years, we are going to take our time pacing this, because we definitely want to ensure creating clienteling at scale is not an easy task and we want to do everything we can to make sure we exceed the customer's expectations if we get a chance to be in their home. I think some of what we have learned around how best to train is now being translated into to your point a bit of a different approach to training. It used to be when we pulled someone on Board we would use other IHAs to a very large extent to really help them understand what was expected of them, how to build a base of business and how to continue to build their clienteling. I think what we have done better now is created a much more standardized training program upfront that we can administer and allows the existing IHAs to continue to build a more robust clienteling capability while we are bringing new IHAs up to speed and getting them ready and working quickly. And so, I think, the team is learning a lot about how best to bring people on, what you train them in first, how to take your more experienced IHAs and put them against some of the more complex jobs. All of those are turning -- helping us continue to refine the IHA model. So to your point, I don't know if I would say it's just accelerated as much as us continuing to take the learning and pace where we think is appropriate based on the demand we are seeing. Importantly, I would also underscore the example that we gave in the New York market, which is we also think there are specific markets where this offering could be and should be even more relevant than others. When you look at the data about how people want to interact with us, how they want help in their homes, we think we uniquely have a really interesting opportunity to help people in their homes in these markets, and therefore, our ramping and training a little bit differently for some of these markets. Thank you. Thank you. This one is so difficult and we talked about before there just really isn't a precedent for where we are right now and there are a lot of moving pieces. And as you can imagine, both our teams and our vendors are employing a number of strategies. In the third quarter specifically, we definitely saw a limited number of small price increases. And if you look at the items that were on the list on 4A things like TVs, and especially, some of the smaller screen size. I think in general what's difficult, though, is that you now have quite a few items that are on any of the less than elasticities for any given individual item are incredibly difficult. And in fact, I think, it's even more difficult as you head into Q4, which is a highly promotional season and we will be less about whether or not there's a tariff on any individual item, it will be about promotional positioning throughout the quarter. And so I give our teams a great deal of credit for pretty carefully navigating thus far and to have really good plans into Q4 and we are seeing a variety of mitigation tactics go into place. We talked about this last time we had the call, obviously, we are thinking about where we assort and who we assort, definitely we are seeing promotional decisions being made by every single retailer out there as we head into this period. Obviously some of these are global vendors and they are thinking about how they move their supply chain, what pieces and parts they put into and how they decide to structure any of their different assemblies and we are already seeing some of the manufacturing move. And so, yes, we saw a little bit of impact into Q3, but as Matt said, it wasn't material enough for us to quantify our call out. Q4 I think is all about price and promotion, and how you are positioning, and we will see how this evolves as we head into next year. So, obviously, we are not going to guide for next year yet. But I think what we like about this year is it underscores what has been our strategic point of view and that is people want and need electronics and those are going to continue to evolve over time and we have a very unique offering digitally in our stores and in-home that will help people make the best decisions and keep their products working.  As we head into next year, there's obviously some things to be excited about. And counter point to that or at least something else to consider is the ongoing impact of tariffs potentially as we head into next year. So what the teams are doing right now as you can imagine is working through all of that, all the mitigation strategies that I just talked about and thinking about how we can put together the right suite of offers and experiences for our customers next year. I think no matter what, we feel like strategically we are positioned in the right way to capitalize on and commercialize new technology, which consistently we are able to do in a way that is very unique in the marketplace. It's interesting. We don't talk about it as much or talk about the M&A in it as much, but if you go into our stores, almost every what we would commercially refer to as department is connected to the next one or could be connected to the next one. And our associates are uniquely well-suited to help people navigate through the compatibility or the ability for people to connect broadly in their homes. 5G we have talked about it, it's going to be a slow roll. It's going to be market by market. But we have also said, we think there will be some interesting product innovation and that we again uniquely are able to help the consumer through what's available specifically for them in their market and how could it show up for them in their home in a very seamless and integrated way. And I think, you will see and you have seen the stores continue to evolve in ways that highlight that interconnected capability. And I think, again, our team will, obviously, capitalize on that ability to commercialize any new technology, excuse me, that's coming down the pipe that will help capitalize on 5G and just processing and information power that will provide. So first on the holiday selling season, every bit of consumer data would say consumers are starting earlier in the hopes that they actually can finish earlier. We don't ever know exactly how that plays out for them, but that is every bit of consumer data that we are seeing. And I think every bit of data that we have seen certainly over the last five years is that the promotional cycle continues to pull earlier and earlier, and that more and more people are launching ads and deals earlier and earlier. Additionally, the fulfillment options that are available to people have completely changed the competitive landscape in terms of how quickly you can get your items with next day, same day, in-store pick-up, all of these being available and we feel particularly strategically relevant for us with our physical locations, our ability to be in your home, our next day available to 99% of the ZIP codes this really suits us well. And so our point of view is that the less days is much less relevant than it used to be historically and that you are going to capture that demand slightly differently, but that demand is coming. We like to joke and say there's still the same number of days between Halloween and Christmas, and so we feel like shoppers are going to meet their needs the way that they want given all the fulfillment options. In terms of the Intel news, our team would say they feel very well-equipped for holidays and that we have the right products. We have -- Matt talked about inventory, very good inventory levels, lots of availability both in our stores and online. And then we will continue to work on that issue as we head into the next year. And I would argue our merchants are very good at navigating situations like this and are working towards the impacts for next year. Thank you. No. I would just underscore, I think, this is a place where the team's done a great job every computer that you could want to look at, feel and touch and get help with is available. And in spaces like now where there's clearly interest on processing power, interest in high-end tablets, interest in computing, we are just very well-positioned to capitalize on that. So thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you in our Q4 call in February, and we all hope -- we hope that you all have a safe and very happy holidays. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 01:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nMollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported $9.54 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 20 basis points, and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08, which was up 19% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our comparable sales growth of 1.6% was on top of a very strong 6.2% last year and within our guidance range for the quarter. The international segment comparable sales declined 1.9%, driven primarily by continued soft macroeconomic conditions in Canada. Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 1.9% as we continue to drive the customer experience across online, stores and home. From a product category standpoint, the comparable sales were buoyed by strength in appliances, tablets and headphones, personally offset by declines in gaming and home theater. The Q2 profitability was better than expected, primarily driven by strong expense management. This points to the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. Before, I talk about the progress we have made on our Building the New Blue strategy and our continued excitement about our strategic opportunities, I would like to address the latest development on the topic of tariff. As you know, since our last earnings call, the administration finalized the products on List 4 and the timing of their implementation. We were a very active participant in the official comment process, and we are pleased, the administration decided to delay the effective date of many of the products on the List until December 15th. We believe this will mitigate some of the impact of higher prices for American consumers during the holiday season. So, List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date is September 1st, and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smart watches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. Given the trends, many of our vendors are in the process of migrating their manufacturing out of China. Our merchants are also addressing this new contest, with a view to minimize costs and risks while continuing to offer exciting technology products and solutions to our customers. As a result, while there will be some short-term volatility, we expect to adapt to this new environment. Let me say a few words about the updated annual fiscal \u201820 guidance we are providing today, and that Matt will expand on later in the call. On the topline, we narrowed the revenue range; on bottom-line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. This reflects the continued momentum of our strategic initiatives. It also includes our best estimate of the impact from the List 4 tariffs and the most recent announcement regarding List 3 moving to a 30% rate, net of the actions we are taking to mitigate their impact, including bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementation, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, promotional and pricing strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors. As others have noted, it is difficult to factor in the uncertainty related to overall customer buying behavior. It is hard to predict how at the macro level consumers will react to higher prices resulting from tariffs. As you would imagine, the general overall volatility in the financial markets adds a level of caution to our outlook. This is a rapidly evolving situation and our teams are doing an excellent job adapting on a daily basis. As we have said before, we are supportive of free and fair trade between the U.S. and China, and appreciate the delay on many products. And we\u2019re actively engaged in mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on consumers and our business. The tariffs do not change our excitement about our strategic opportunities, however. And I would now like to talk about the progress we are making on our Building the New Blue strategy. An example of our growing commitment to health, during Q2, we launched a new collection of connected fitness products from some of the world\u2019s most innovative exercise companies, including Hydrow, ProForm, Hyperice and NordicTrack. This new assortment includes a range of connected bikes and rowing machines and recovery system loved by many pro athletes. The collection is available now on bestbuy.com with a new dedicated fitness space coming to more than 100 stores by the end of the year. Our store employees and In-Home Advisors will receive special training to help customers discover, understand and purchase the equipment, whether in a store or in their home. And Best Buy and Geek Squad will manage delivery and installation. Meanwhile, we continue to make progress both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services, and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Last quarter, we updated you on our acquisition of a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST, to help more quickly scale the commercial monitoring business. Earlier this month, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, including the hiring of the Company\u2019s data science and engineering team based in Watertown, Massachusetts. These talented employees drive innovation through wearable sensor technology that addresses some of the biggest challenges faced by the aging population, such as falls. These tuck-in acquisitions together with GreatCall, complement our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better help seniors live longer in their homes, help reduce their healthcare costs, and bring greater peace of mind for their families and caregivers. We look forward to spending more time on our health strategy at our Investor update next month. Speaking of Geek Squad, during Q2, we continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We grew the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to continually improve the customer experience. Additionally, Best Buy is now fully certified chain-wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation\u2019s largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repairs. Nearly 10,000 of our Geek Squad agents have completed training for all Apple device repairs. And all of our nearly 1,000 stores are equipped with Apple authorized repair tools and parts. As you would imagine, consumers can schedule their repair by going to bestbuy.com, but what you might not know is that they can also go to Apple\u2019s own website to schedule a repair at Best Buy. More than 200 Best Buy stores across the U.S. have been Apple authorized service providers since 2017 and have enjoyed strong customer satisfaction scores. So, we are pleased to expand that partnership with Apple to provide even more consumers with convenient access to safe and reliable repairs. And it drives traffic. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or reengaged Best Buy customers. This is another great example of something we can do with our vendor partners that others cannot. In addition to tech services, we provide our customers with a number of financing options that help them acquire the products they need and also create stickiness over time with our brand. For example, sales transacted on our Best Buy credit card were 25% of total sales last year, and that number is growing. We always offer customers our branded credit card first. However, there are people who may not be interested in getting a credit card or are unable to qualify for it because of low credit scores, or in many cases, simply no credit history. And that\u2019s where our new lease-to-own program comes in. Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see customers use lease-to-own to acquire products across a wide variety of categories, with the largest being computing. We also continued to see a significant number of customers take advantage of the 90-day purchase option, which consists of an additional payment plus the retail price. Later this quarter, we expect to launch lease-to-own in nine more states, including California and New York, which will complete our full 45-state rollout. We believe that this program will build over time as our associates continue to get up to speed on the offer, consumer awareness if it grows and as we enhance the customer experience, both in our stores and online. As we continue to implement these important customer-facing initiatives, we\u2019re also taking steps to evolve our retail model. In Q2, we made strategic changes to our field operations, to accelerate growth, and to create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. We did this because we know that customers interact with us across all channels, but at times, it can be confusing or repetitive for them to navigate Best Buy as we were organized. At the same time, as we look at our penetration by geographic market, we see that it varies wildly, yet our tools and structure have been one size fits all for our local markets. So, we have reengineered retail in a way that puts the customer at the center and empowers the local leaders to serve their customers in ways that best suit them and take advantage of local opportunities. We have put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their market. We believe these changes will simplify processes and allow us to seize growth opportunities within individual markets. It will also create an environment for our employees to grow and allow our teams to collaborate more effectively and efficiently in service of our customers. One of the opportunities we continue to be the most excited about is home where we continue to increase the number of In-Home Advisors to meet consumer demand, and expect to be at around 700 advisors at year-end. With the changes we made to our operating model, there is more local leadership support to deepen the advisors development, customer expertise and performance. And we are focused on a seamless customer experience in the home, no matter how it\u2019s delivered. We also continue to focus on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. For example, for back-to-school, we are integrating influencers and YouTube into our advertising in an interactive way. Also this year, we have increased our use of digital videos that feature real life Best Buy associates, providing authentic tech insights. These videos celebrate the passion, expertise and knowledge of our people, highlighting the role they play as inspiring friends for our customers. This is driving increased trust among viewers, and the highest unique viewers and watch times we\u2019ve seen across our YouTube channel. From a digital innovation standpoint, starting with the Samsung Note 10 launch, bestbuy.com launched the ability for customers to trade in their old phone to purchase a new one, something that was previously only available in physical stores. Since we have expanded this to a multichannel capability, a customer can put the full traded value of their previous phone towards the purchase of a new device instantly, thus improving the customer experience regardless of the channel. To improve the home theater shopping experience in the app, we launched augmented reality capabilities that can help customers select the right TV. This new capability allows customers to place three dimensional virtual TVs that are correctly scaled to size on a wall or table. This feature is driving higher customer confidence in choosing the right screen size and as a result, higher conversion, and we expect to also reduce returns. Supply chain is also an area where we have strong momentum. Since our last earnings call, we have automated three additional distribution centers across the country. And we will go live with another automated facility prior to the holiday season. We also relocated one of our local distribution centers to a larger facility to support our growth in major appliances. These changes support our strategy to offer enhanced speed of delivery to customers. As we have shared previously, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. And while same-day delivery is an important offer, we have found that our customers really value two things: They want free delivery and many want to be able to get it the next day. We offer next day delivery for thousands of products in 64 metro areas that reach 80% of Best Buy customers. This is free for orders over $35 and does not require a membership fee. Of course, you all know that we also provide our customers the extremely convenient option to pick up their products at one of our nearly 1,000 stores. What you may not realize is that we promise their items to be ready within one hour of placing their order and on average, those orders are ready within just 40 minutes. We also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and help offset pressures. During the second quarter, we achieved $155 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $730 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is toward our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. So, we\u2019ve not only exceeded our goal, we did it over a year early. We have now successfully delivered on three considerable cost reduction targets in the last seven years, totaling more than $2 billion. We plan to provide a new long-term cost reduction and efficiency target at our Investor Update next month. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the first half of the year. And we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunities ahead of us as we continue to make great progress on our Building the New Blue strategy. I want to thank our associates across the Company for their hard work and dedication every day to help deliver on our purpose to enrich lives through technology. At Best Buy, we strive to be a purposeful, value-driven human organization. With that in mind, we are very proud of the recognition we have received in recent months for being a top employer. We ranked number seven on Forbes list of America\u2019s best employers for women and for the first time earned a spot on the Indeed\u2019s list of the 50 top-rated workplaces. We were also named a best place to work for disability inclusion. And we are changing the world together as noted by Fortune magazine, which recently included us on its Change the World List. This list recognizes companies for using their business strategy and operations to make a positive human, social or environmental impact. All of these awards underscore our mission, which is to build a purposeful company that does good things for the world and great things for all our stakeholders. Now, before I turn the call over to him, I would first like to say a few words about our new CFO, Matt Bilunas. For obvious reasons, the search for a new CFO was a personal one. First, I was picking the person to take my old job and run a functioning and team I know and love. And second, any CEO will tell you that a strong finance partner is critical to their personal success and the success of the Company they lead. I worked closely with Matt for more than a decade. I trust him and I\u2019m completely confident that his experience, skills and commitment to the Company\u2019s continued growth make him the perfect choice for this role. I will now turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Bilunas: Thanks, Corie. Good morning, and hello, everyone. It\u2019s a huge honor to be given the opportunity to help lead this Company forward as CFO. We have made tremendous progress in how we enrich people\u2019s lives through technology, and I am confident we will continue to build even deeper relationships with our customers as we serve them online, in stores and in their homes. During my 13 years at Best Buy, I\u2019ve had the benefit of being in the field, working with the international team, and leading financial planning and analysis teams during the turnaround effort. Now, I\u2019m excited to lead our world class finance organization, which has been instrumental to our success here at Best Buy. Now, on to Q2 financial details. Let me begin by talking about our results versus expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.54 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08. EPS results exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to strong expense management. A lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.7% to $9.54 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.6%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.17, or 19% to $1.08. This increase was driven by one, increased operating income dollars from both the higher operating income rate and higher revenue; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, a $0.04 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 2.1% to $8.82 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.9% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 13 format store closure -- large format store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both majors and small appliances, tablets and headphones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming and home theater categories. In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 10.7% versus last year. Part of the growth was due to the refinement of revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. In Q4 fiscal 2019, we refined the revenue recognition for a Total Tech Support offer because we had sufficient history of member utilization to move from recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the membership contract to recognizing revenue on a usage basis, therefore better matching the fulfillment costs with revenue. This results in more of the annual fee being recognized upfront as the customer usage of the program is heaviest when they first become members. This refinement of revenue recognition impacts new contracts created since the start of our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter on a prospective basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.42 billion was 16.1% of domestic revenue, up from 14% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 17.3% on top of 10.1% growth in the second quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $715 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 120 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by comparable sales in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23.9%. The domestic gross profit rate was 24% versus 23.8% last year. The 20 basis-point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate, which was partially offset by higher supply chain costs. International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23.8%, primarily due to a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin from the services category. Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion, or 19.9% of revenue, which increased $24 million and decreased 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.74 billion or 19.7% of revenue versus 19.8% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars increased $23 million due to GreatCall\u2019s operating expenses and higher advertising expense, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense versus last year. International SG&A was $166 million, or 23.2% of revenue versus $165 million or 22.3% of revenue last year. The $1 million increase included an impairment charge for discontinued technology in Canada, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. During the quarter, we recorded $48 million of restructuring charges, the majority of which was driven by a retail operating model change as Corie mentioned earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to 25.4% last year. The favorability versus last year was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and a favorable resolution of certain tax matters. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of CST, which was funded with approximately $125 million of existing cash. The acquisition of CST is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year. We returned a total of $363 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $230 million and dividends of $133 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to prior year. As we previously announced, we still intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Finally, we now expect the capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our outlook reflects the strong earnings performance in the first half of the year, as well as our best estimate of the tariff impacts and consumer buying behaviors in a very fluid environment. To be clear, the guidance we are providing today incorporates the estimated impact of the List 4 tariffs that Corie described and also includes our assumptions related to List 3 moving from a 25% to a 30% tariff rate. Specifically, for the full year, we now expect enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.6 billion and enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.7% to 1.7%. As a reminder, this top-line growth expectation is on top of the best two-year stack in 14 years and reflects factor such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be flat to slightly up to fiscal 2019\u2019s rate of 4.6%, reflecting our continued focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range with the $5.60 to $5.75, which compares to our previous guidance $5.45 to $5.65. I would like to share a few of the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Consistent with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, we expect both gross profit and SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As a reminder, we have also shared there would be variations between the quarters. Our guidance today implies a higher year-over-year operating income rate in Q3 and a lower operating income rate in Q4. A lower year-over-year operating rate in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year and now also includes the tariff changes we have discussed today. For the third quarter specifically, we are expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion; enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1 to $1.05; non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 26.5%l and the diluted weighted average share count of approximately 267 million shares. I would like to provide additional items of color for Q3. We expect our Q3 gross profit rate to expand versus last year. We expect the gross profit rate expansion to be higher than the year-over-year increase we reported in Q2. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the very low single digits. At this time, we do not expect the recent tariff announcements to have much of an impact on our Q3 performance. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Katie McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations, Corie and Matt. I wanted just to ask about the supply chain costs that were noted in the gross margin discussion. Could you go into any more detail about what drove that during the quarter?\nCorie Barry: Yes. So, there\u2019s a couple of things that sit under that. And they\u2019ve been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. First, the first piece that is just overarchingly a little bit more spend, especially when it comes to some of our large cube and the growth that we\u2019ve seen, frankly, online where we\u2019ve been investing in speed. The second part of that is more the strategic side of the investments that we started talking about at our Investor Day two years ago. And we\u2019ve been putting some capital into, especially as it relates to things we talked about today, around automating some of those metro ecommerce centers, and around investing in some of the incremental facilities that we need in order to support the large cube growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, you\u2019ve got a little bit of both things, both just systemically the higher volumes, and then secondarily, the more strategic investments, hence the reason we talked about those continuing throughout the rest of the year here.\nKate McShane: Okay, great. And if I could just ask one follow-up about your guidance and the narrowing of the range on the top line. Could you talk about what\u2019s a little bit better than expected on the low end of that, and is the lowering of the top line exclusively tariff related?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, for guidance purposes, I think what we\u2019re looking at for the rest of this year, one of the things that sequentially changes from the first part this year is a little bit more of a drag from the gaming category that we saw in the first part of the year. So, gaming was quite bit stronger in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And so, we are seeing a bit of -- a bit more weighted impact from that business being expected to be down a little bit more in the back half of this year. That\u2019s the biggest sequential probably change going forward as we look towards the back half of the year.\nCorie Barry: And to answer the other part of your question, Kate. The tariff impact is built in there; it is not exclusively related to the tariff impact. This is just taking into account some of the trends that Matt\u2019s talking about as well as some of our estimates around the impact of tariff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nPeter Keith: I did want to follow up on the tariff question. So, you provided a lot of good detail. But, I guess, I wanted to understand the approach that you\u2019re thinking about for pricing, because presumably, there may not be that many price increases in calendar year \u201819, but there could be a lot more to come in 2020. So, maybe strategically, do you think that a fair share of items will see price increases? And how do you think about the sort of the portfolio approach to managing through that?\nCorie Barry: Yes. This is the most difficult place for us to make projections. I think, you understand better than anyone, and there\u2019s a bit of art and a bit of science to estimating this. And we don\u2019t exactly have a precedence for the quantity of moving pieces that we have in place right now. There\u2019s a few things we\u2019re trying to take into account here. So, first, you know this is -- there\u2019s a lot of changes still going on in terms of what exactly is on the List, when they\u2019re implemented and at what rate. And there\u2019s even some public comments around potentially some vendors being exempted. And so, we\u2019re watching that but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s moving there. Second, as we\u2019ve already seen, we believe many vendors are going to continue to migrate their manufacturing out of China. And so, we think the total prospect of business that\u2019s impacted is going to be materially less, even just next year, because you\u2019re seeing those supply chains already start to move. And then, third, the impacted -- what we think is really impacted in our business is actually substantially less than the overarching quantity that is affected by tariffs, meaning our teams are doing really excellent work. We talked about it in prepared remakes, with mitigating strategies to help offset some of the impacts here. And so, the piece that\u2019s impacted is actually substantially smaller than the overall affected quantity of SKUs. And so, we\u2019re working to understand what that looks like into next year. But, to get precise around exactly where it\u2019s going to result in price increases, where the promotional environment will land because we\u2019re only going to stay price competitive, and how that actually shows up next year, it\u2019s going to still take us some work from here.\nPeter Keith: And then, separately, maybe looking out to next year and contemplating some near-term headwinds around gaming and mobile. I was hoping you could talk about some of the technology innovations that you see evolving over the next one to two years, and thinking specifically around 5G, 8K TVs, and potentially a new console cycle. If you have any thoughts on how that may impact your business?\nMike Mohan: Peter, it\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. It might be a little too early to give you specifics on those categories. But we\u2019re excited about all of them. And I think about what Corie talked about and how we\u2019ve realigned our field structure to support our markets. And that gives us an opportunity, as technology needs to be either showcased in the store environment or actually in people\u2019s homes to leverage more resources and be able to have Best Buy partner with whomever it may be in this case with 5G; it\u2019s our carrier to show what the technology can do well beyond what it would do on a phone like it is today. We\u2019re quite excited about where the evolution in TVs is going because it plays into where Best Buy is historically done best showcasing technology and making sure we can get product to customers\u2019 homes. And while gaming is a drag this year, every time we\u2019ve had a new console cycle, our ability to get products in consumers\u2019 hands in a way that matters to them and support them with solutions, and now in this case with Total Tech Support has us quite excited. But, we\u2019ll probably give a bit more color on those technologies as we get into our fiscal \u201821 guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: So, I wanted to follow up on the guidance question a little bit more. So, just to think about it, you beat about $0.27 year-to-date, guided up 3Q about $0.08 and raised the year $0.10 to $0.15. So, it seems like you\u2019re lowering the fourth quarter, I guess implied versus the Street by $0.20 to $0.25. Is that accurate? And I know you talked about the gaming headwinds and the tariff. But, maybe you could talk, maybe break that down a little bit more. Was the gaming headwind that you\u2019re now assuming, presumably most acute to 4Q, sort of how much do you assume comp might benefit from an AUR perspective as prices go up? And then, on the margin line, gaming being worse, I would think would be better from a gross margin perspective. But, obviously you have the tariffs. So, I know, it\u2019s a very specific question, but really trying to understand how you thought about the fourth quarter update?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I\u2019ll start, and then Matt can follow. What I\u2019m saying, first of all, is, the general cadence of the year is flowing exactly how we expected it. And so, that\u2019s good. And I think your estimate on that 20% -- or $0.20 plus, taking it down is on the high side. Because we saw early in the year, there would be some pressure to Q4. Matt will go into that a little bit. But, what I think overarchingly, what I would say is, it\u2019s less of a takedown than that. And it\u2019s more of what we were talking about before, us just trying to do our best to estimate what we think -- with all the mitigation strategies, what we think some of the implications might be in Q4, which we said on the call is a bit of a moving target. Matt, maybe you can provide some more color on what we see going into the year.\nMatt Bilunas: Absolutely. So, Q4 lower rate is largely being driven by number of items we contemplated in the original guidance. It\u2019s primarily result of lower gross profit rate, compared to last year. And there are a number of factors that are driving that. But first, it might be helpful to point out, for the last three quarters, we\u2019ve been seeing some sources of expansion that will lap in Q4 this year. The first one is the revenue recognition refinement to Total Tech Support offer last Q4. That\u2019s been expanding our margins a little bit since Q4 last year. The second is the acquisition of GreatCall, which we completed October last year, and we cycle that in Q4 of this year. So, that won\u2019t be a source of expansion. And on top of that, what we\u2019re seeing is slightly lower product margin rates in Q4. We\u2019re giving the teams a little bit of flexibility. It\u2019s important for them to have some to navigate through the holiday period. So, product rates are down a little bit in Q4. The second source of a little bit more pressure that we contemplated already was the services category. We\u2019re seeing -- we know we have a reduced profit share in Q4, because we had one last Q4. The other is in the area of supply, delivery and install where we\u2019re seeing a higher volume of large product that requires a little more install costs and delivery costs. And lastly, we knew that supply chain costs would continue to be a drag year-on-year in Q4. They\u2019re a little more of a drag in Q4 than they are going to be in Q3. Again, all of those things were contemplated as we went into the guidance at the beginning of the year. The one thing we did add was the expectation of the tariff impact, which Corie mentioned. So, that would be the new thing that we put in. But, we knew most of that pressure was coming when we started the year.\nChris Horvers: And then, as a follow-up, the gross margin in Canada was very strong here in the third quarter, and presumably this is the maturation of the services model in that market, which I believe was ahead of the U.S. So, what does this tell us about the gross margin tailwinds that you might see as you get into 2020 in the domestic business, given that I think it is lagging from a rollout perspective?\nCorie Barry: So, first, I want to reinforce what you said, which is definitely we\u2019re seeing Canada lap now a few years of having their version of what we call Total Tech Support. But their version is quite different. So, I want to be clear about that. They -- and we\u2019ve talked about this before. They started with different models than we have. In their case, most often, it\u2019s an offer that includes a warranty proposition with it, but also has support across the business. It\u2019s offered a little bit differently by category. So, I wouldn\u2019t say exactly what they\u2019re seeing is going to be perfectly replicated in the U.S. because we\u2019re looking at more of a pure support offer. But, at the same, time, we like what we\u2019re seeing there. We\u2019re trying to learn from what they\u2019re doing in Canada, and at the same time, figure out what\u2019s right for our customers. Obviously, we\u2019re not dying next year yet. But, like we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re happy with the ramp in TTS. And the best news is our customers clearly value having support across their devices, whether they bought them from us or somewhere else. And so that frankly, and the stickiness of those customers is what\u2019s most important to us here in the U.S.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Chukumba: Corie, you provided a little bit of color on rent-to-own including the fact it\u2019s going to be I guess rolled out to an additional nine states. Any color you can provide in terms of the comp lift from rent-to-own? I mean, was it material in the second quarter, and what are your expectations for that comp lift as the year progresses?\nCorie Barry: Yes. So, what I\u2019d start with is that we said it last time, we\u2019re going to consistently say it, this is a great offer. It\u2019s great for our brand. It\u2019s great for our customers. And I think we said it out on the prepared remarks, financing options for our customers is really important. 25% of the business is done on our own branded card. You can see that it\u2019s important to have options. We always start with the Best Buy credit card, but now we have something additional that is available to customers who either might not want that as an option, or might not qualify. Lease-to-own is having a positive impact on our comps, but we\u2019re not going to show the exact details. And the reason is because this is a program we would expect to build over time. We\u2019re still really early in this one. I mean, we\u2019re only into the first quarter of having it rolled out into two thirds of our stores. Over time, we think our sales associates will get more and more comfortable with the offering for our customers. We think customer awareness will continue to increase. We need to continue to implement some experience improvements. And ideally, we want to make this available online next year, as well as obviously very important to have a digital offering. And then, to your point, we still have nine states to go, two of those being California and New York, some big ones. So, like we expected, we\u2019re definitely still seeing a number of customers use this program who are either new to Best Buy or that we haven\u2019t seen for a while. And so, we continue to like that. We\u2019ll give a little bit more color on this one at the Investor Update next month. But, in general, we definitely like how it\u2019s ramping and piecing. And most importantly, it\u2019s something that our customers seem to like. And the feedback we get from our associates is also that it\u2019s really nice to have this as a secondary financing option.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Presumably you had existing purchase orders in place for your holiday product prior to when these tariffs are going to come in and your vendors are the importer of record. So, are you going to be sharing in the actual tariff impact, given those dynamics? And if so, can you quantify what the price increase you -- contribution you\u2019ve factored into your fourth quarter comp guidance? It looks like the domestic segment in the 1% to 2% range. And then, as part of that, how has the elasticity of the laundry equipment business that did see some tariffs earlier, informed your view on how this whole situation is going to unfold? Thank you very much.\nMike Mohan: Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start and then maybe Corie can chime in. When I look at -- to answer to your first question, yes, with all of our vendors, we have existing purchase orders forecast commitments and contracts around what we pay for items and how we bring them into the country. To give you color on what might be changing, it will be far too soon to tell you that because some of the stuff\u2019s already been on the water, some of the stuff\u2019s actually in the U.S., some of the stuff may not have price increases, some of these items may evolve to different models before there\u2019s any really significant price impact, whether they get sourced from another factory outside of China, or really wrap to something else that\u2019s got a different feature set that would warrant a price increase. So, as we tried to explain in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s very, very fluid as to what we\u2019re doing. The one thing I would probably leave you with on that point is the significance that Best Buy plays in the overall consumer electronics market worldwide, does give us more leverage than I think -- than we can probably explain on a call like this. But, it gives us exposure, because of where we source merchandise from, the ability to get to customers with the newest technology that create the right buying cycles is really important. And we\u2019re working with every one of our partners from where they source. Well, they\u2019re the importer of record, as you noted, to mitigate any impact to consumers on pricing and to us. On a comment around appliances, there\u2019s very little to draw from that, and I\u2019ll let Corie add anything in between. Given we\u2019ve been living with price increases from a variety of reasons for the last almost two years, that category is very driven to duress and replacement. And there\u2019s a different elasticity when you\u2019re not trying to drive demand for a natural purchase. So, we\u2019ve got good understanding, but it doesn\u2019t apply a lot of go forward logic here. So, Corie?\nCorie Barry: Yes. What\u2019s really tricky, and we started on it with the earlier question. I mean, we think that of our total cost of goods sold about 60% comes from China. But, it\u2019s a massively smaller portion of that that is actually, we think affected by the tariffs because of some of the negotiating power, because of the mitigating strategies that we\u2019re putting in place. To your point about price elasticity, Q4 is also a really different quarter. I mean, keep in mind, this is a very promotional quarter and we will always be price competitive. So, the team is working through what stands from prior history of price elasticity, a little bit different in Q4. So, to Mike\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got a team who\u2019s working with our vendors, doing a really excellent job with the various mitigating strategies that they have in place, and then frankly, positioning us for the holiday really well.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you. My follow-up question is on the Progressive situation. It seemed like that\u2019s gaining a good amount of traction, given all the comments that you\u2019ve made. Would your domestic comps have been positive without the Progressive relationship?\nCorie Barry: We\u2019re not going to give the exact comps for Progressive, like we said before, and because mainly it\u2019s really early. We\u2019re still ramping. We\u2019re learning a lot. And ideally, over time, we continue to see better and better results from that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ray Stochel of Consumers Edge Research.\nRay Stochel: How do you think about your TV assortment now versus prior years? A couple points on that would be different approaches your vendors are taking on smart TVs and as a result over the top services. And then, how do you think about your TV supply chain and product mix compared to others in terms of geographical sourcing around tariffs? Thanks.\nMike Mohan: Hey, Ray. It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. I feel very good, to answer your question about our TV assortment, now versus prior years. Best Buy has a history of leading innovation in this space, whether it\u2019s the connectivity of the device, the technology in the screen, or what size the TV is, and those are the three factors, I think people are looking at the most. Interestingly, as more people look for solutions with streaming services, I would hope you would see that by taking a leading role, helping explain what people can do that you didn\u2019t think was possible. And getting a unified experience across multiple steps in their homes or finding ways to perhaps save some money. And we\u2019re working on ideas that can take advantage of the fact that 25% of our customers use the Best Buy credit card, and how can you blend the fact that we can help making buying device easier, perhaps with what you want to do with it. So, I\u2019ll stop the comment with that there. When I think about our TV supply chain, yes, TVs are impacted on List 4A. Those are specifically TVs that are sourced out of China. And so, just as a reminder for the group listening that a bulk of Best Buy\u2019s business is on the large screen size, and those TVs are sourced out of Mexico. And those products are primarily 55-inch and larger TV sets. And we feel very good about those and where they\u2019re positioned and our inventory levels and the prices and the promotions we build and run on those. And when it comes to the products that are sourced out of China with an advanced lead time, I also feel good about what we have currently in inventory. And we\u2019ll look at our assortment as we move forward, based on where the demand signals are, if there\u2019s any pricing implications to them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. \nSteven Forbes: I wanted to start with a follow-up on the tightening of the full-year comp guidance and the commentary about the second half uncertainty. So, maybe if you can, just expand on what you\u2019re seeing today, right, as it relates to your consumers\u2019 conversion patterns, both in the store and online, inclusive of trade down or maybe just lower traffic conversion rates. I mean, are you seeing anything that gives you pause today or is it is it more just about conservatism, right, as we head into holiday here?\nCorie Barry: No. I would definitely not characterize us seeing anything that gives concern today. I mean, I think we\u2019re very pleased with an almost 2 comp domestically here in Q2. We\u2019re seeing good buying behavior and I think we continue to see -- consumer is really interested in the products that we sell. And so, that gives us confidence heading into the back half here. We definitely tightened the range, because A, we\u2019ve just made it through half the year, and the result are there for the first half of the year; and then B, we\u2019re doing our best to look at specific category that we\u2019ve actually mentioned at the beginning of the year, like gaming or like the slowdown in mobile and just making sure that we feel like we take those into account. And then, finally, doing our best in a very fluid and changing environment to think through what we think the implications are in our categories in the back half.\nSteven Forbes: And so, that\u2019s sort of a perfect segue into my follow-up here. You think about sort of your initial outlook for certain product category growth in 2020, whether it\u2019s an acceleration in certain categories, like gaming and mobile maybe even TVs. I mean, what categories did you -- sort of the greatest amount of pause as you conceptualize the potential demand implications of rising retail prices, given the likelihood that maybe underlying industry growth should be better next year as well?\nMike Mohan: Steve, it\u2019s Mike. Peter asked a pretty similar question around what we see for next year. The best way I\u2019d characterize it is, there\u2019s a lot of technology that\u2019s on the forefront of becoming more mainstream for consumers with what we\u2019re seeing this year. 8K TV is a great example of the connectivity solutions with streaming. There is a couple of services that are going to go live later this year that will create excitement in this space. There\u2019s continued demand for people to want to stay connected. And I think this is the way we\u2019re building relationships and memberships around our Total Tech Support offer. But, put those all together, add them into things we\u2019re seeing with good tailwinds, like our appliance business, the places that we\u2019re competing very well. That\u2019s how I\u2019d look at the landscape of categories right now. But again, it\u2019s too soon to give category specifics for our fiscal \u201821 guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nCurtis Nagle: Maybe just a little more specificity, if you could on gaming and why you think, I guess, second half of the year might be a little bit tougher than you initially thought, if I understood your comments correctly.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. The gaming cycle is well known, and as the years progressed what we\u2019ve seen is as there is more visibility to a couple of new platforms that have yet to be announced, but are well regarded as they\u2019re coming into play by next holiday season. The demand on the current console business is just off slightly, more than we would have anticipated. And some of the things that are filling in the space that always happens when a gaming cycle happens, are coming in at lower price points. The demand is quite good but is coming in at lower ASP. So, based on those factors and looking at where the category is in this cycle in advance of its next route that would probably indicate why we see some softness more than we expected.\nCurtis Nagle: And Matt, I think, you alluded to this in some of your commentary in terms of I think that 4Q, but what are you guys expecting in terms of promotional intensity in the quarter? I know things are very fluid. But, any more color on that would be helpful.\nCorie Barry: Yes. I think Q4 -- I think, it\u2019s always a promotional period. And obviously, we\u2019ve said it before, it is often used as a traffic driver as that eye catching price point. We would continue to expect that to be the case in this Q4. I think, we continue to expect the deals to start earlier and to last longer, I mean all of the things that we\u2019ve pretty consistently been saying. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s wickedly out of the ordinary or anything in front of us that looks completely different. But, it\u2019s always a promotional period. And I give our teams a ton of credit for their ability to plan for and then really effectively manage through any great Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Just to clarify something on the guidance, and this -- I guess, on cautiousness about or uncertainty consumer spending in the back half. It sounds like that\u2019s entirely pushed into the fourth quarter, right, there you\u2019re not seeing anything that gives you pause around the third quarter. And Corie, I think you mentioned it\u2019s a mix of tariff uncertainty as well as a little bit of category uncertainty. And then, just as part of that and you were asked this earlier, Corie, if you look at like the In-Home Advisor business, not seeing anything where conversion is being affected or you\u2019re seeing lower tickets or just consumers taking a longer time to decide to convert on orders?\nCorie Barry: I\u2019ll start with the latter from an IHA perspective. We\u2019re not seeing really any changes in behavior as we continue to -- and that\u2019s why we made a point that we continue to ramp our IHAs, and we\u2019re matching that to the demand that we\u2019re seeing. And we continue to really like how that business is performing, so not really seeing anything there. Matt, I don\u2019t know if you have any comments on the overall top-line.\nMatt Bilunas: No. The overall top-line, I think like we said, we see categories come up and down, like we always do. As we look at this point in the year, gaming is -- like we said is the biggest sequential drag as you look at the back half. I think, the rest of the categories as you look into Q3 are kind of like what we expected them to be, gaming be a little bit of a change. I think, there is also what Corie said earlier, there is always a level of caution as you look at the back half of the year with this type of market. Most of that is probably geared toward Q4, but there is also a little bit over in Q3 as well as we start to see and the tariffs start to come in.\nSimeon Gutman: My follow-up, just one more on lease-to-own. Can you share with us -- I\u2019m assuming your expectation is that it\u2019s going to bring in -- or you\u2019re going to find new customers into the business. But, can you tell us thus far in the markets that it\u2019s been rolled out. Is it just -- is it an existing customer who is just electing to finance their purchase differently or is it a new customer to Best Buy?\nCorie Barry: We definitely are seeing some level of new customer. I mean, between the new customers that we\u2019re seeing and what I call reengaged or people we haven\u2019t seen very frequently, that\u2019s actually the majority of who we\u2019re seeing use the program. So, we like the fact that it\u2019s engaging for us a very different customer, maybe one that\u2019s been less frequent with us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Congrats Corie and Matt. A question I have, you thought -- we spent a lot of time talking here about the uncertainty that tariffs and maybe some product cycles you bring to the second half of the year, you\u2019ve done a great job managing SG&A, even while you are investing, continue to invest in the business. So, the question I have is, to the extent that sales do track a bit choppier or maybe softer over the next few quarters, what leverage do you have on the SG&A side? How would you -- how could you react on the SG&A side to offset that?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I\u2019m going to answer this in two ways. So, first of all, just to directly talk about SG&A, I mean, I think this quarter was a great example of our teams really being able to continue to find cost efficiencies in the business and to continue to manage the business really tightly. And I think, we have a pretty good track record of being able to flex with the business ebb and flow. And so, I feel really good heading into the back half that our teams are well set up, to be able to manage the SG&A in a way that makes sense. That being said, we\u2019ve been very clear that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business in ways that are going to bring this strategy to life. And I want to be clear and say, we continue to invest in the business, and we believe strongly in the strategy that we\u2019re bringing. And we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re going to make those choices as we go through quarter-to-quarter. And so, yes, we definitely can manage what\u2019s manageable behind the scenes, but we\u2019re also very thoughtfully trying to make sure that we invest. And you\u2019ve seen the returns on those investments continue to improve. And so, I think, it feels like we\u2019re doing the right thing. That being said, I mean, I know the start of the question is all about kind of the choppiness of the top-line. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say and Matt said it too, we continue to be pleased with people and customers\u2019 interest in technology. And while yes, obviously we\u2019re trying to take into account the tariffs, that is genuinely, continuously a very quickly evolving situation. And I just want to reiterate that our teams are doing excellent work with mitigation strategies and at the same time, we\u2019re already seeing a lot of our vendors make some moves and move considerably some of that products. I mean, we talk about our current percent of COGS. We think next year that percent of COGS could be more like 40%. And so, I think it\u2019s really important to note that while we\u2019re talking about a little bit of this choppiness for the back half, the teams and our vendor partners are working together hard to continue to mitigate the impact of those tariffs. And so, yes, we\u2019ll continue to work the SG&A, but I also want to be clear, we like where the strategy is going and we continue to have a really strong point of view that customers are interested in that we were coming to market and the products that we have.\nBrian Nagel: And then, a follow-up -- and I\u2019m going to apologize, because I think half the questions here, to some extent are better than what you\u2019ve got. So, I\u2019m going to add one more to that. But, if we look at the narrowing of the guidance for the year, and I know to a certain extent we\u2019re splitting hairs because we gave small numbers. But you narrowed more from the top end than you did in the bottom end. If tariffs were not an issue, if the tariffs were not something to consider, how would that guidance -- how could that guidance look or that how could the shift in guidance look?\nCorie Barry: So, this is the hardest question and almost nearly impossible for me to answer, because the tariffs aren\u2019t just about how they impact the individual SKUs, they\u2019re also about the consumer conditions, the macro conditions. And we\u2019ve seen -- I mean, tariff has been a point of conversation for almost 18 months now. And so, the constant morphing of tariffs and having that as part of the conversation, it\u2019s literally almost impossible for me to strip out and say just List 4 did this. It\u2019s more us trying to take that big step back and say, where do we see the implications, where do we see the consumer and how do we think that\u2019s going to impact the back half. And again, remember, part of the narrowing of the range is also just what we\u2019ve seen already in the first six months of the year. So, it\u2019s impossible to strip that out.\nBrian Nagel: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you. Before ending, thank you for the questions. I think that was our last. I would like to thank you, Matt, and congratulate you on your first earnings call, and thank you, Mike, for joining us. And I would also like to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Update meeting on September 25th from the New York Stock Exchange, where we will have the pleasure of sharing with you an update on our strategic progress. The event will be webcast live and additional details can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Mohan",
            "content": "Peter, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. It might be a little too early to give you specifics on those categories. But we're excited about all of them. And I think about what Corie talked about and how we've realigned our field structure to support our markets. And that gives us an opportunity, as technology needs to be either showcased in the store environment or actually in people's homes to leverage more resources and be able to have Best Buy partner with whomever it may be in this case with 5G; it's our carrier to show what the technology can do well beyond what it would do on a phone like it is today. We're quite excited about where the evolution in TVs is going because it plays into where Best Buy is historically done best showcasing technology and making sure we can get product to customers' homes. And while gaming is a drag this year, every time we've had a new console cycle, our ability to get products in consumers' hands in a way that matters to them and support them with solutions, and now in this case with Total Tech Support has us quite excited. But, we'll probably give a bit more color on those technologies as we get into our fiscal \u201821 guide. Hey, Michael. It's Mike. I'll start and then maybe Corie can chime in. When I look at -- to answer to your first question, yes, with all of our vendors, we have existing purchase orders forecast commitments and contracts around what we pay for items and how we bring them into the country. To give you color on what might be changing, it will be far too soon to tell you that because some of the stuff's already been on the water, some of the stuff's actually in the U.S., some of the stuff may not have price increases, some of these items may evolve to different models before there's any really significant price impact, whether they get sourced from another factory outside of China, or really wrap to something else that's got a different feature set that would warrant a price increase.

On a comment around appliances, there's very little to draw from that, and I'll let Corie add anything in between. Given we've been living with price increases from a variety of reasons for the last almost two years, that category is very driven to duress and replacement. And there's a different elasticity when you're not trying to drive demand for a natural purchase. So, we've got good understanding, but it doesn't apply a lot of go forward logic here. So, Corie? Hey, Ray. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. I feel very good, to answer your question about our TV assortment, now versus prior years. Best Buy has a history of leading innovation in this space, whether it's the connectivity of the device, the technology in the screen, or what size the TV is, and those are the three factors, I think people are looking at the most. Interestingly, as more people look for solutions with streaming services, I would hope you would see that by taking a leading role, helping explain what people can do that you didn't think was possible. And getting a unified experience across multiple steps in their homes or finding ways to perhaps save some money. And we're working on ideas that can take advantage of the fact that 25% of our customers use the Best Buy credit card, and how can you blend the fact that we can help making buying device easier, perhaps with what you want to do with it. So, I'll stop the comment with that there. When I think about our TV supply chain, yes, TVs are impacted on List 4A. Those are specifically TVs that are sourced out of China. And so, just as a reminder for the group listening that a bulk of Best Buy's business is on the large screen size, and those TVs are sourced out of Mexico. And those products are primarily 55-inch and larger TV sets. And we feel very good about those and where they're positioned and our inventory levels and the prices and the promotions we build and run on those. And when it comes to the products that are sourced out of China with an advanced lead time, I also feel good about what we have currently in inventory. And we'll look at our assortment as we move forward, based on where the demand signals are, if there's any pricing implications to them. Steve, it's Mike. Peter asked a pretty similar question around what we see for next year. The best way I'd characterize it is, there's a lot of technology that's on the forefront of becoming more mainstream for consumers with what we're seeing this year. 8K TV is a great example of the connectivity solutions with streaming. There is a couple of services that are going to go live later this year that will create excitement in this space. There's continued demand for people to want to stay connected. And I think this is the way we're building relationships and memberships around our Total Tech Support offer. But, put those all together, add them into things we're seeing with good tailwinds, like our appliance business, the places that we're competing very well. That's how I'd look at the landscape of categories right now. But again, it's too soon to give category specifics for our fiscal \u201821 guide."

            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Thanks, Corie. Good morning, and hello, everyone. It's a huge honor to be given the opportunity to help lead this Company forward as CFO. We have made tremendous progress in how we enrich people's lives through technology, and I am confident we will continue to build even deeper relationships with our customers as we serve them online, in stores and in their homes. During my 13 years at Best Buy, I've had the benefit of being in the field, working with the international team, and leading financial planning and analysis teams during the turnaround effort. Now, I'm excited to lead our world class finance organization, which has been instrumental to our success here at Best Buy. Now, on to Q2 financial details. Let me begin by talking about our results versus expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.54 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08. EPS results exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to strong expense management. A lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.7% to $9.54 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.6%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.17, or 19% to $1.08. This increase was driven by one, increased operating income dollars from both the higher operating income rate and higher revenue; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, a $0.04 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 2.1% to $8.82 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.9% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 13 format store closure -- large format store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both majors and small appliances, tablets and headphones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming and home theater categories. In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 10.7% versus last year. Part of the growth was due to the refinement of revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. In Q4 fiscal 2019, we refined the revenue recognition for a Total Tech Support offer because we had sufficient history of member utilization to move from recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the membership contract to recognizing revenue on a usage basis, therefore better matching the fulfillment costs with revenue. This results in more of the annual fee being recognized upfront as the customer usage of the program is heaviest when they first become members. This refinement of revenue recognition impacts new contracts created since the start of our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter on a prospective basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.42 billion was 16.1% of domestic revenue, up from 14% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 17.3% on top of 10.1% growth in the second quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $715 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 120 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by comparable sales in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23.9%. The domestic gross profit rate was 24% versus 23.8% last year. The 20 basis-point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall's higher gross profit rate, which was partially offset by higher supply chain costs. International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23.8%, primarily due to a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin from the services category. Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion, or 19.9% of revenue, which increased $24 million and decreased 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.74 billion or 19.7% of revenue versus 19.8% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars increased $23 million due to GreatCall's operating expenses and higher advertising expense, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense versus last year. International SG&A was $166 million, or 23.2% of revenue versus $165 million or 22.3% of revenue last year. The $1 million increase included an impairment charge for discontinued technology in Canada, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. During the quarter, we recorded $48 million of restructuring charges, the majority of which was driven by a retail operating model change as Corie mentioned earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to 25.4% last year. The favorability versus last year was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and a favorable resolution of certain tax matters. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of CST, which was funded with approximately $125 million of existing cash. The acquisition of CST is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year. We returned a total of $363 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $230 million and dividends of $133 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to prior year. As we previously announced, we still intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Finally, we now expect the capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our outlook reflects the strong earnings performance in the first half of the year, as well as our best estimate of the tariff impacts and consumer buying behaviors in a very fluid environment. To be clear, the guidance we are providing today incorporates the estimated impact of the List 4 tariffs that Corie described and also includes our assumptions related to List 3 moving from a 25% to a 30% tariff rate. Specifically, for the full year, we now expect enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.6 billion and enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.7% to 1.7%. As a reminder, this top-line growth expectation is on top of the best two-year stack in 14 years and reflects factor such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be flat to slightly up to fiscal 2019's rate of 4.6%, reflecting our continued focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range with the $5.60 to $5.75, which compares to our previous guidance $5.45 to $5.65. I would like to share a few of the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Consistent with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, we expect both gross profit and SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As a reminder, we have also shared there would be variations between the quarters. Our guidance today implies a higher year-over-year operating income rate in Q3 and a lower operating income rate in Q4. A lower year-over-year operating rate in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year and now also includes the tariff changes we have discussed today. For the third quarter specifically, we are expecting the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion; enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1 to $1.05; non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 26.5%l and the diluted weighted average share count of approximately 267 million shares. I would like to provide additional items of color for Q3. We expect our Q3 gross profit rate to expand versus last year. We expect the gross profit rate expansion to be higher than the year-over-year increase we reported in Q2. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the very low single digits. At this time, we do not expect the recent tariff announcements to have much of an impact on our Q3 performance. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Yes. Thanks for the question. So, for guidance purposes, I think what we're looking at for the rest of this year, one of the things that sequentially changes from the first part this year is a little bit more of a drag from the gaming category that we saw in the first part of the year. So, gaming was quite bit stronger in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And so, we are seeing a bit of -- a bit more weighted impact from that business being expected to be down a little bit more in the back half of this year. That's the biggest sequential probably change going forward as we look towards the back half of the year. Absolutely. So, Q4 lower rate is largely being driven by number of items we contemplated in the original guidance. It's primarily result of lower gross profit rate, compared to last year. And there are a number of factors that are driving that. But first, it might be helpful to point out, for the last three quarters, we've been seeing some sources of expansion that will lap in Q4 this year. The first one is the revenue recognition refinement to Total Tech Support offer last Q4. That's been expanding our margins a little bit since Q4 last year. The second is the acquisition of GreatCall, which we completed October last year, and we cycle that in Q4 of this year. So, that won't be a source of expansion. And on top of that, what we're seeing is slightly lower product margin rates in Q4. We're giving the teams a little bit of flexibility. It's important for them to have some to navigate through the holiday period. So, product rates are down a little bit in Q4. The second source of a little bit more pressure that we contemplated already was the services category. We're seeing -- we know we have a reduced profit share in Q4, because we had one last Q4. The other is in the area of supply, delivery and install where we're seeing a higher volume of large product that requires a little more install costs and delivery costs. And lastly, we knew that supply chain costs would continue to be a drag year-on-year in Q4. They're a little more of a drag in Q4 than they are going to be in Q3. Again, all of those things were contemplated as we went into the guidance at the beginning of the year. The one thing we did add was the expectation of the tariff impact, which Corie mentioned. So, that would be the new thing that we put in. But, we knew most of that pressure was coming when we started the year. Yes. The gaming cycle is well known, and as the years progressed what we've seen is as there is more visibility to a couple of new platforms that have yet to be announced, but are well regarded as they're coming into play by next holiday season. The demand on the current console business is just off slightly, more than we would have anticipated. And some of the things that are filling in the space that always happens when a gaming cycle happens, are coming in at lower price points. The demand is quite good but is coming in at lower ASP. So, based on those factors and looking at where the category is in this cycle in advance of its next route that would probably indicate why we see some softness more than we expected. No. The overall top-line, I think like we said, we see categories come up and down, like we always do. As we look at this point in the year, gaming is -- like we said is the biggest sequential drag as you look at the back half. I think, the rest of the categories as you look into Q3 are kind of like what we expected them to be, gaming be a little bit of a change. I think, there is also what Corie said earlier, there is always a level of caution as you look at the back half of the year with this type of market. Most of that is probably geared toward Q4, but there is also a little bit over in Q3 as well as we start to see and the tariffs start to come in."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported $9.54 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 20 basis points, and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08, which was up 19% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our comparable sales growth of 1.6% was on top of a very strong 6.2% last year and within our guidance range for the quarter. The international segment comparable sales declined 1.9%, driven primarily by continued soft macroeconomic conditions in Canada. Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 1.9% as we continue to drive the customer experience across online, stores and home. From a product category standpoint, the comparable sales were buoyed by strength in appliances, tablets and headphones, personally offset by declines in gaming and home theater. The Q2 profitability was better than expected, primarily driven by strong expense management. This points to the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. Before, I talk about the progress we have made on our Building the New Blue strategy and our continued excitement about our strategic opportunities, I would like to address the latest development on the topic of tariff. As you know, since our last earnings call, the administration finalized the products on List 4 and the timing of their implementation. We were a very active participant in the official comment process, and we are pleased, the administration decided to delay the effective date of many of the products on the List until December 15th. We believe this will mitigate some of the impact of higher prices for American consumers during the holiday season. So, List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date is September 1st, and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smart watches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. Given the trends, many of our vendors are in the process of migrating their manufacturing out of China. Our merchants are also addressing this new contest, with a view to minimize costs and risks while continuing to offer exciting technology products and solutions to our customers. As a result, while there will be some short-term volatility, we expect to adapt to this new environment. Let me say a few words about the updated annual fiscal \u201820 guidance we are providing today, and that Matt will expand on later in the call. On the topline, we narrowed the revenue range; on bottom-line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. This reflects the continued momentum of our strategic initiatives. It also includes our best estimate of the impact from the List 4 tariffs and the most recent announcement regarding List 3 moving to a 30% rate, net of the actions we are taking to mitigate their impact, including bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementation, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, promotional and pricing strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors. As others have noted, it is difficult to factor in the uncertainty related to overall customer buying behavior. It is hard to predict how at the macro level consumers will react to higher prices resulting from tariffs. As you would imagine, the general overall volatility in the financial markets adds a level of caution to our outlook. This is a rapidly evolving situation and our teams are doing an excellent job adapting on a daily basis. As we have said before, we are supportive of free and fair trade between the U.S. and China, and appreciate the delay on many products. And we're actively engaged in mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on consumers and our business. The tariffs do not change our excitement about our strategic opportunities, however. And I would now like to talk about the progress we are making on our Building the New Blue strategy. An example of our growing commitment to health, during Q2, we launched a new collection of connected fitness products from some of the world's most innovative exercise companies, including Hydrow, ProForm, Hyperice and NordicTrack. This new assortment includes a range of connected bikes and rowing machines and recovery system loved by many pro athletes. The collection is available now on bestbuy.com with a new dedicated fitness space coming to more than 100 stores by the end of the year. Our store employees and In-Home Advisors will receive special training to help customers discover, understand and purchase the equipment, whether in a store or in their home. And Best Buy and Geek Squad will manage delivery and installation. Meanwhile, we continue to make progress both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services, and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Last quarter, we updated you on our acquisition of a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST, to help more quickly scale the commercial monitoring business. Earlier this month, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, including the hiring of the Company's data science and engineering team based in Watertown, Massachusetts. These talented employees drive innovation through wearable sensor technology that addresses some of the biggest challenges faced by the aging population, such as falls. These tuck-in acquisitions together with GreatCall, complement our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better help seniors live longer in their homes, help reduce their healthcare costs, and bring greater peace of mind for their families and caregivers. We look forward to spending more time on our health strategy at our Investor update next month. Speaking of Geek Squad, during Q2, we continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We grew the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to continually improve the customer experience. Additionally, Best Buy is now fully certified chain-wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation's largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repairs. Nearly 10,000 of our Geek Squad agents have completed training for all Apple device repairs. And all of our nearly 1,000 stores are equipped with Apple authorized repair tools and parts. As you would imagine, consumers can schedule their repair by going to bestbuy.com, but what you might not know is that they can also go to Apple's own website to schedule a repair at Best Buy. More than 200 Best Buy stores across the U.S. have been Apple authorized service providers since 2017 and have enjoyed strong customer satisfaction scores. So, we are pleased to expand that partnership with Apple to provide even more consumers with convenient access to safe and reliable repairs. And it drives traffic. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or reengaged Best Buy customers. This is another great example of something we can do with our vendor partners that others cannot. In addition to tech services, we provide our customers with a number of financing options that help them acquire the products they need and also create stickiness over time with our brand. For example, sales transacted on our Best Buy credit card were 25% of total sales last year, and that number is growing. We always offer customers our branded credit card first. However, there are people who may not be interested in getting a credit card or are unable to qualify for it because of low credit scores, or in many cases, simply no credit history. And that's where our new lease-to-own program comes in. Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see customers use lease-to-own to acquire products across a wide variety of categories, with the largest being computing. We also continued to see a significant number of customers take advantage of the 90-day purchase option, which consists of an additional payment plus the retail price. Later this quarter, we expect to launch lease-to-own in nine more states, including California and New York, which will complete our full 45-state rollout. We believe that this program will build over time as our associates continue to get up to speed on the offer, consumer awareness if it grows and as we enhance the customer experience, both in our stores and online. As we continue to implement these important customer-facing initiatives, we're also taking steps to evolve our retail model. In Q2, we made strategic changes to our field operations, to accelerate growth, and to create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. We did this because we know that customers interact with us across all channels, but at times, it can be confusing or repetitive for them to navigate Best Buy as we were organized. At the same time, as we look at our penetration by geographic market, we see that it varies wildly, yet our tools and structure have been one size fits all for our local markets. So, we have reengineered retail in a way that puts the customer at the center and empowers the local leaders to serve their customers in ways that best suit them and take advantage of local opportunities. We have put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their market. We believe these changes will simplify processes and allow us to seize growth opportunities within individual markets. It will also create an environment for our employees to grow and allow our teams to collaborate more effectively and efficiently in service of our customers. One of the opportunities we continue to be the most excited about is home where we continue to increase the number of In-Home Advisors to meet consumer demand, and expect to be at around 700 advisors at year-end. With the changes we made to our operating model, there is more local leadership support to deepen the advisors development, customer expertise and performance. And we are focused on a seamless customer experience in the home, no matter how it's delivered. We also continue to focus on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. For example, for back-to-school, we are integrating influencers and YouTube into our advertising in an interactive way. Also this year, we have increased our use of digital videos that feature real life Best Buy associates, providing authentic tech insights. These videos celebrate the passion, expertise and knowledge of our people, highlighting the role they play as inspiring friends for our customers. This is driving increased trust among viewers, and the highest unique viewers and watch times we've seen across our YouTube channel. From a digital innovation standpoint, starting with the Samsung Note 10 launch, bestbuy.com launched the ability for customers to trade in their old phone to purchase a new one, something that was previously only available in physical stores. Since we have expanded this to a multichannel capability, a customer can put the full traded value of their previous phone towards the purchase of a new device instantly, thus improving the customer experience regardless of the channel. To improve the home theater shopping experience in the app, we launched augmented reality capabilities that can help customers select the right TV. This new capability allows customers to place three dimensional virtual TVs that are correctly scaled to size on a wall or table. This feature is driving higher customer confidence in choosing the right screen size and as a result, higher conversion, and we expect to also reduce returns. Supply chain is also an area where we have strong momentum. Since our last earnings call, we have automated three additional distribution centers across the country. And we will go live with another automated facility prior to the holiday season. We also relocated one of our local distribution centers to a larger facility to support our growth in major appliances. These changes support our strategy to offer enhanced speed of delivery to customers. As we have shared previously, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. And while same-day delivery is an important offer, we have found that our customers really value two things: They want free delivery and many want to be able to get it the next day. We offer next day delivery for thousands of products in 64 metro areas that reach 80% of Best Buy customers. This is free for orders over $35 and does not require a membership fee. Of course, you all know that we also provide our customers the extremely convenient option to pick up their products at one of our nearly 1,000 stores. What you may not realize is that we promise their items to be ready within one hour of placing their order and on average, those orders are ready within just 40 minutes. We also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and help offset pressures. During the second quarter, we achieved $155 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $730 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is toward our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. So, we've not only exceeded our goal, we did it over a year early. We have now successfully delivered on three considerable cost reduction targets in the last seven years, totaling more than $2 billion. We plan to provide a new long-term cost reduction and efficiency target at our Investor Update next month. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the first half of the year. And we're excited about the long-term opportunities ahead of us as we continue to make great progress on our Building the New Blue strategy. I want to thank our associates across the Company for their hard work and dedication every day to help deliver on our purpose to enrich lives through technology. At Best Buy, we strive to be a purposeful, value-driven human organization. With that in mind, we are very proud of the recognition we have received in recent months for being a top employer. We ranked number seven on Forbes list of America's best employers for women and for the first time earned a spot on the Indeed's list of the 50 top-rated workplaces. We were also named a best place to work for disability inclusion. And we are changing the world together as noted by Fortune magazine, which recently included us on its Change the World List. This list recognizes companies for using their business strategy and operations to make a positive human, social or environmental impact. All of these awards underscore our mission, which is to build a purposeful company that does good things for the world and great things for all our stakeholders. Now, before I turn the call over to him, I would first like to say a few words about our new CFO, Matt Bilunas. For obvious reasons, the search for a new CFO was a personal one. First, I was picking the person to take my old job and run a functioning and team I know and love. And second, any CEO will tell you that a strong finance partner is critical to their personal success and the success of the Company they lead. I worked closely with Matt for more than a decade. I trust him and I'm completely confident that his experience, skills and commitment to the Company's continued growth make him the perfect choice for this role. I will now turn the call over to Matt. Yes. So, there's a couple of things that sit under that. And they've been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. First, the first piece that is just overarchingly a little bit more spend, especially when it comes to some of our large cube and the growth that we've seen, frankly, online where we've been investing in speed. The second part of that is more the strategic side of the investments that we started talking about at our Investor Day two years ago. And we've been putting some capital into, especially as it relates to things we talked about today, around automating some of those metro ecommerce centers, and around investing in some of the incremental facilities that we need in order to support the large cube growth that we've seen. So, you've got a little bit of both things, both just systemically the higher volumes, and then secondarily, the more strategic investments, hence the reason we talked about those continuing throughout the rest of the year here. And to answer the other part of your question, Kate. The tariff impact is built in there; it is not exclusively related to the tariff impact. This is just taking into account some of the trends that Matt's talking about as well as some of our estimates around the impact of tariff. Yes. This is the most difficult place for us to make projections. I think, you understand better than anyone, and there's a bit of art and a bit of science to estimating this. And we don't exactly have a precedence for the quantity of moving pieces that we have in place right now. There's a few things we're trying to take into account here. So, first, you know this is -- there's a lot of changes still going on in terms of what exactly is on the List, when they're implemented and at what rate. And there's even some public comments around potentially some vendors being exempted. And so, we're watching that but there's a lot that's moving there. Second, as we've already seen, we believe many vendors are going to continue to migrate their manufacturing out of China. And so, we think the total prospect of business that's impacted is going to be materially less, even just next year, because you're seeing those supply chains already start to move. And then, third, the impacted -- what we think is really impacted in our business is actually substantially less than the overarching quantity that is affected by tariffs, meaning our teams are doing really excellent work. We talked about it in prepared remakes, with mitigating strategies to help offset some of the impacts here. And so, the piece that's impacted is actually substantially smaller than the overall affected quantity of SKUs. And so, we're working to understand what that looks like into next year. But, to get precise around exactly where it's going to result in price increases, where the promotional environment will land because we're only going to stay price competitive, and how that actually shows up next year, it's going to still take us some work from here. Yes. I'll start, and then Matt can follow. What I'm saying, first of all, is, the general cadence of the year is flowing exactly how we expected it. And so, that's good. And I think your estimate on that 20% -- or $0.20 plus, taking it down is on the high side. Because we saw early in the year, there would be some pressure to Q4. Matt will go into that a little bit. But, what I think overarchingly, what I would say is, it's less of a takedown than that. And it's more of what we were talking about before, us just trying to do our best to estimate what we think -- with all the mitigation strategies, what we think some of the implications might be in Q4, which we said on the call is a bit of a moving target. Matt, maybe you can provide some more color on what we see going into the year. So, first, I want to reinforce what you said, which is definitely we're seeing Canada lap now a few years of having their version of what we call Total Tech Support. But their version is quite different. So, I want to be clear about that. They -- and we've talked about this before. They started with different models than we have. In their case, most often, it's an offer that includes a warranty proposition with it, but also has support across the business. It's offered a little bit differently by category. So, I wouldn't say exactly what they're seeing is going to be perfectly replicated in the U.S. because we're looking at more of a pure support offer. But, at the same, time, we like what we're seeing there. We're trying to learn from what they're doing in Canada, and at the same time, figure out what's right for our customers. Obviously, we're not dying next year yet. But, like we said in our prepared remarks, we're happy with the ramp in TTS. And the best news is our customers clearly value having support across their devices, whether they bought them from us or somewhere else. And so that frankly, and the stickiness of those customers is what's most important to us here in the U.S. Yes. So, what I'd start with is that we said it last time, we're going to consistently say it, this is a great offer. It's great for our brand. It's great for our customers. And I think we said it out on the prepared remarks, financing options for our customers is really important. 25% of the business is done on our own branded card. You can see that it's important to have options. We always start with the Best Buy credit card, but now we have something additional that is available to customers who either might not want that as an option, or might not qualify. Lease-to-own is having a positive impact on our comps, but we're not going to show the exact details. And the reason is because this is a program we would expect to build over time. We're still really early in this one. I mean, we're only into the first quarter of having it rolled out into two thirds of our stores. Over time, we think our sales associates will get more and more comfortable with the offering for our customers. We think customer awareness will continue to increase. We need to continue to implement some experience improvements. And ideally, we want to make this available online next year, as well as obviously very important to have a digital offering. And then, to your point, we still have nine states to go, two of those being California and New York, some big ones. So, like we expected, we're definitely still seeing a number of customers use this program who are either new to Best Buy or that we haven't seen for a while. And so, we continue to like that. We'll give a little bit more color on this one at the Investor Update next month. But, in general, we definitely like how it's ramping and piecing. And most importantly, it's something that our customers seem to like. And the feedback we get from our associates is also that it's really nice to have this as a secondary financing option. Yes. What's really tricky, and we started on it with the earlier question. I mean, we think that of our total cost of goods sold about 60% comes from China. But, it's a massively smaller portion of that that is actually, we think affected by the tariffs because of some of the negotiating power, because of the mitigating strategies that we're putting in place. To your point about price elasticity, Q4 is also a really different quarter. I mean, keep in mind, this is a very promotional quarter and we will always be price competitive. So, the team is working through what stands from prior history of price elasticity, a little bit different in Q4. So, to Mike's point, we've got a team who's working with our vendors, doing a really excellent job with the various mitigating strategies that they have in place, and then frankly, positioning us for the holiday really well. We're not going to give the exact comps for Progressive, like we said before, and because mainly it's really early. We're still ramping. We're learning a lot. And ideally, over time, we continue to see better and better results from that. No. I would definitely not characterize us seeing anything that gives concern today. I mean, I think we're very pleased with an almost 2 comp domestically here in Q2. We're seeing good buying behavior and I think we continue to see -- consumer is really interested in the products that we sell. And so, that gives us confidence heading into the back half here. We definitely tightened the range, because A, we've just made it through half the year, and the result are there for the first half of the year; and then B, we're doing our best to look at specific category that we've actually mentioned at the beginning of the year, like gaming or like the slowdown in mobile and just making sure that we feel like we take those into account. And then, finally, doing our best in a very fluid and changing environment to think through what we think the implications are in our categories in the back half. Yes. I think Q4 -- I think, it's always a promotional period. And obviously, we've said it before, it is often used as a traffic driver as that eye catching price point. We would continue to expect that to be the case in this Q4. I think, we continue to expect the deals to start earlier and to last longer, I mean all of the things that we've pretty consistently been saying. I don't see anything that's wickedly out of the ordinary or anything in front of us that looks completely different. But, it's always a promotional period. And I give our teams a ton of credit for their ability to plan for and then really effectively manage through any great Q4. I'll start with the latter from an IHA perspective. We're not seeing really any changes in behavior as we continue to -- and that's why we made a point that we continue to ramp our IHAs, and we're matching that to the demand that we're seeing. And we continue to really like how that business is performing, so not really seeing anything there. Matt, I don't know if you have any comments on the overall top-line. We definitely are seeing some level of new customer. I mean, between the new customers that we're seeing and what I call reengaged or people we haven't seen very frequently, that's actually the majority of who we're seeing use the program. So, we like the fact that it's engaging for us a very different customer, maybe one that's been less frequent with us. Yes. I'm going to answer this in two ways. So, first of all, just to directly talk about SG&A, I mean, I think this quarter was a great example of our teams really being able to continue to find cost efficiencies in the business and to continue to manage the business really tightly. And I think, we have a pretty good track record of being able to flex with the business ebb and flow. And so, I feel really good heading into the back half that our teams are well set up, to be able to manage the SG&A in a way that makes sense. That being said, we've been very clear that we're going to continue to invest in the business in ways that are going to bring this strategy to life. And I want to be clear and say, we continue to invest in the business, and we believe strongly in the strategy that we're bringing. And we're going to -- we're going to make those choices as we go through quarter-to-quarter. And so, yes, we definitely can manage what's manageable behind the scenes, but we're also very thoughtfully trying to make sure that we invest. And you've seen the returns on those investments continue to improve. And so, I think, it feels like we're doing the right thing. That being said, I mean, I know the start of the question is all about kind of the choppiness of the top-line. Here's what I'd say and Matt said it too, we continue to be pleased with people and customers' interest in technology. And while yes, obviously we're trying to take into account the tariffs, that is genuinely, continuously a very quickly evolving situation. And I just want to reiterate that our teams are doing excellent work with mitigation strategies and at the same time, we're already seeing a lot of our vendors make some moves and move considerably some of that products. I mean, we talk about our current percent of COGS. We think next year that percent of COGS could be more like 40%. And so, I think it's really important to note that while we're talking about a little bit of this choppiness for the back half, the teams and our vendor partners are working together hard to continue to mitigate the impact of those tariffs. And so, yes, we'll continue to work the SG&A, but I also want to be clear, we like where the strategy is going and we continue to have a really strong point of view that customers are interested in that we were coming to market and the products that we have. So, this is the hardest question and almost nearly impossible for me to answer, because the tariffs aren't just about how they impact the individual SKUs, they're also about the consumer conditions, the macro conditions. And we've seen -- I mean, tariff has been a point of conversation for almost 18 months now. And so, the constant morphing of tariffs and having that as part of the conversation, it's literally almost impossible for me to strip out and say just List 4 did this. It's more us trying to take that big step back and say, where do we see the implications, where do we see the consumer and how do we think that's going to impact the back half. And again, remember, part of the narrowing of the range is also just what we've seen already in the first six months of the year. So, it's impossible to strip that out. Thank you. Before ending, thank you for the questions. I think that was our last. I would like to thank you, Matt, and congratulate you on your first earnings call, and thank you, Mike, for joining us. And I would also like to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Update meeting on September 25th from the New York Stock Exchange, where we will have the pleasure of sharing with you an update on our strategic progress. The event will be webcast live and additional details can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMollie O'Brien: Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO, Corie Barry, our CFO and Chief Transformation Officer and Mike Mohan, our U.S. Chief Operating Officer. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Hubert.\nHubert Joly: Thank you Mollie and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for what is my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. As you know, we made an exciting announcement last month. On June 11, Corie Barry will become the fifth CEO in Best Buy's 53 year history. At that time, I will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman of the Board. Also, Mike Mohan role will be elevated as he moves from being our domestic Chief Operating Officer to the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. I am very proud of the seamless transition we have decided to implement as it reflects positively on our momentum as well as on our focus on executive development and succession planning. It is clearly designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity and I am grateful to the members of our Board of Directors for their diligence and care in overseeing this critical process. Before I share more thoughts on our leadership transition, let me first review our quarterly performance and provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our financial results and outlook. So Q1 was a strong quarter and a good start to the year. We reported $9.14 billion in revenue and grew our enterprise comparable sales by 1.1%, which was at the high end of our guidance. We also delivered better-than-expected profitability. We expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 50 basis points and delivered on non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.02, which was up 24% compared to the first quarter of last year. I want to thank our associates across the company for their hard work and dedication in delivering these strong results. Before I discuss the progress we made on our Best Buy 2020 strategy, I would like to share some brief thoughts on tariffs on goods from China. First, let me say that the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. They have done this in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors. Second, -- [AUDIO GAP]\nOperator: Pardon the interruption. This is the operator. We are having a little bit of trouble hearing you, sir. Sir, we are still unable to hear you.\nHubert Joly: Okay.\nOperator: Sir, we are still having a little bit of trouble hearing you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing a temporary interruption in today's call. Please stand by and the call will recommence very shortly. Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. The conference will now recommence.\nHubert Joly: We are sorry for the interruption because of and I apologize for that, technical issue. I will recommence my comments with when I started to talk about tariffs and tariffs on goods from China. So what I was saying is that first, the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. And they have done is in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors. Second, no decision has been made by the administration at this point on the actual implementation of tariffs on additional product categories. There is a comprehensive process the administration will be going through to take inputs and we intend to be actively engaged in this process to help the administration continue to minimize the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers. In addition, there is time for the trade negotiations to progress before any decision gets made. As Corie will discuss, our fiscal 2020 guidance incorporates the estimated impact of the recent move from 10% to 25% tariffs on this List 3. As a reminder, we estimate that List 3, which is the $200 billion list that went into effect last September is only about 7% of our total annual cost of goods sold. Many of the products on this list are accessories. And while we understand List 4 as proposed is comprised of many consumer items, including many electronics, we think it is premature to speculate on the impact of further tariffs as it is unclear whether List 4 will actually be implemented, what products would ultimately be included, at what rates and when. But one thing is of course certain as other retailers have noted the impact of tariffs at 25% will result in price increases and will be shelled by U.S. consumers. We will of course continue to work to minimize the impact of the trade negotiations on U.S. consumers and will continue to update you on this matter. Now let me update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives with technology and further develop our competitive differentiation. In health, we continue to make progress, both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Our focus is to enable seniors to live longer in their homes and help reduce their healthcare costs. We believe that the combination of technology and our human touch provided through the ability to access and engage people in their home is a highly relevant and differentiated proposition. We are excited to continue to build our capabilities to support the growth of this business. First, we will be opening a third GreatCall caring center in October. The center, located in San Antonio, Texas with 400 care agents and provide 24x7 technical phone support, concierge services and urgent response services to customers. Second, this month we have required a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST to help scale the commercial monitoring business. CST has approximately 100,000 senior subscribers. Some of [indiscernible] services as a supplemental benefits under their Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage under Medicare Advantage plans is helpful to growing our commercial business because it allows us to engage with insurers and build our service into their plans as a way to both improve their member experience and help them save on costs. The acquisition of CST will thereby help facilitate our access to in penetration of the commercial market. We are excited about the prospects of combining CST's services and relationships with the existing GreatCall business. More broadly, this tuck-in acquisition, together with GreatCall, complements our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better serve both the seniors in their home and those who support them like payors and providers. During Q1, we also continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We continue to grow the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to drive the customer experience. Another first quarter example of how we are expanding what we do for customers is the rollout of our lease-to-own program. The financing provided through our Best Buy credit card is an important benefit we offer customers where there are people who are going to be interested in getting a credit card who are unable to quantify for it because of low credit scores or in many cases, simply no credit history. Our lease-to-own program provides another option for enabling customers to make periodic payments over a fixed period eventually leading to full ownership of the product once the agreement has been fulfilled. During the quarter, we launched the offer across 36 states or about 70% of our stores and expect to roll it out to another nine states later this year. Customers are using the option to acquire products across a wide variety of categories with the largest being computing. In addition, we found during the pilot that a significant number of customers are choosing to pick advantage of Progressive Leasing's 90-day purchase option, which consist of a $79 initial payment plus the retail price. The offering is consistent with our strategy to enrich lives through technology by opening up the experiences that we offer to new customers that might not otherwise have the chance to acquire the kind of solutions that we sell. In many cases, it will allow us to catch customers early on in their credit history and build a relationship with them over time. In addition to expanding what we do for customers, we are continuing to evolve the way we interact with our customers across their homes, our stores and digitally. As we mentioned during our last call, we are developing a holistic home strategy to leverage all of the ways we currently interact with customers in their home to create meaningful relationships and further differentiate Best Buy. Our in-home consultation program is one of the ways that we deliver experiences in the home today. The program continues to build and it is clear there is a real customer need we are addressing. And from a financial standpoint, we continue to see higher revenue per order and higher gross profit from these interactions in the store and online. We expect to add a similar number of advisors this year as we did last year, which would put us around 700 advisors at the end of the year. In addition, we are working to enhance the productivity of our advisors, but eliminating manual processes so that they can focus more time on their customers. For example, starting this quarter we will begin automating our proposal and client telling processes and enable the ability for customers to chat online real-time with their advisor. I would also like to say a few words about how we are transforming our supply chain to improve the experience for our customers. When we laid out a multiyear plan at our Investor Day in 2017, we shared our belief that the vast majority of our assortment need to be available anywhere you wanted the next day at the latest. Through a combination of initiatives including expanded partnerships, the deployment of metro e-commerce centers across key cities and automation, we continue to improve our speed of delivery to customers and expand next-day and same-day delivery options. As we shared last quarter, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. In addition, we offer next-day delivery options in 60 metro areas on orders over $35 for free with no membership fees. In fact, customers can order as late as 8 P.M. in Los Angeles and New York City and 5:30 P.M. in the other metro areas and will get their package delivered the next day. 77% of Best Buy customers are in a ZIP Code where we are able to offer this service today and thousands of SKUs are eligible. In addition to our various shipping options, all of our customers also have the extremely convenient option to pick up their products in our stores within one hour of placing their order. Even with all the improved shipping options and enhancements available to our customers, they are increasingly choosing to pick up their products in one of our nearly 1,000 stores. And so in-store pickup of online orders is now about 40% of our online revenue and growing. Automation is an important part of our supply chain transformation and starting in Q4 of last year, we have been rolling out new automating boxing technology in our distribution center that builds real-time custom boxes for products coming down a conveyor belt. Earlier this year, Barron's named Best Buy number one on its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies. And this cutting-edge boxing technology is an example of our sustainability efforts. In addition to driving productivity, it reduces environmental waste by eliminating excess corrugated cardboard and all-plastic packaging fillers. Overall our supply chain strategy is to leverage our assets of stores, distribution centers and metro e-commerce centers in a portfolio approach. That allows us to optimize speed, convenience and cost to meet customer needs at the right time and place. We are still in the midst of this multiyear transformation, but we like where we are and where we are going. Of course, we also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures. During the first quarter, we achieved $35 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $575 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. Before I turn the call over to Corie, I would now like to say a few words about our upcoming management transition and my excitement about the future of our company. The choice of timing of the CEO transition is probably more of an art than a science. I personally felt it was the right time for me to trigger this leadership transition for several reasons. First, I had felt we had achieved what I had hoped to accomplish when I joined on the company in 2012. I am proud of what we have delivered for customers, our employees, our vendors, our shareholders and our communities. Second, I felt we had built the depth and breadth of talent necessary to carry Best Buy into the future. Last September, we put in place a new leadership organization by elevating Corie and Mike to new roles with greater responsibilities. In the time since then, I have been very impressed by the effectiveness of our team and these leaders. Third, with a clear an exciting purpose to enrich lives with technology, we set out two years ago to implement a strategy focused on addressing key human needs in entertainment, productivity, communication, food, security and health and wellness. We have essentially achieved fiscal 2021 revenue and non-GAAP operating income target two years ahead of plan. And while we still have a lot to do from a transformation standpoint, it is clear that we are on the right path. Fourth, we have announced plans to host a meeting with the investment community later this year. I thought it was important that the leaders who stand in front of this audience to lay out our roadmap for the future with a team that is responsible for carrying that strategy forward. So in my new role, I will of course continue to lead the Board of Directors. I will also advise and support Corie on key matters such as strategy, capability building, M&A and external relationships. In addition, I will assume certain responsibilities at Corie's request in areas like government affairs, community relations and leadership development. In closing, let me say that I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us and confidence in the team we have built as well as our talents, culture, heart and soul. I look forward to continuing to work with Corie, the team and the Board in my new role manual to help them strategy and transformation with one goal in mind fulfilling our purpose to enrich lives with technology, doing well by doing good. And I want to thank you, our shareholders and journalists who cover, for your support over the past several years, I have thoroughly enjoyed our ongoing dialogue. Our interactions have not only been stimulating, but it has challenged us to be better as a management team and as a company. And likewise, I want to thank my colleagues for our collaboration and their friendship. Working together, we turned around and then began going this wonderful company. It has been the honor of my professional life to work with all of you as we did this. The company is in good hands with our new leadership and the best of talents we have. And I am confident that the journey we began in 2012 will continue well into the years ahead. And now, I am very excited to turn the call over to our CFO and future CEO, Corie Barry.\nCorie Barry: Good morning everyone. I am deeply grateful to Hubert and the rest of the Board of Directors for their confidence in me and their clear belief that this leadership evolution is in the best interests of Best Buy and all its stakeholders. Nearly seven years ago, the Board made a stunningly good decision when they asked a Frenchman with no retail experience to save this company and he brought his remarkable brain, boundless energy and deep passion to the job. My personal gratitude to Hubert knows no limits and I am delighted to have him nearby to call upon for advice and counsel in his new role as Executive Chair. As I think about my new role, I could not be more fortunate to have Mike Mohan at my side as our President and COO. I have worked closely with Mike for the past 15 years and I am so excited to continue to work with him and the rest of the leadership team in this next chapter as we implement the strategy that we helped build together. As far as my successor in the CFO role, we are in the midst of the search process for a new Chief Financial Officer. Now on to the Q1 financial details. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.14 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02. The EPS result exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the high end of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to a higher gross profit rate and strong expense management. The lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.03 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $9.14 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.1%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 24% to $1.02. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income, which was driven by lower incentive compensation and a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 0.8% to $8.48 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.3% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 105 Best Buy mobile and 12 large-format store code closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances which includes both major and small appliances, wearables and tablets. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our entertainment category. Domestic online revenue of $1.31 billion was 15.4% of domestic revenue, up from 13.6% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 14.5% on top of 12% growth in the first quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue decreased 5.2% to $661 million. This was primarily driven by approximately 390 basis points of negative foreign currency impact and a comparable sales decline of 1.2%. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by positive comparable sales in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 23.7%. The domestic gross profit rate was 23.7% versus 23.3% last year. The 40 basis point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall's higher gross profit rate and improved product margin rates, which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiative. These favorable items were partially offset by higher supply chain costs. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 80 basis points to 24.2%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which included improved gross profit rates in several product categories and increased revenue in the higher margin rate services category. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.82 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which decreased $5 million and 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.66 billion or 19.6% of revenue versus 19.7% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year as GreatCall operating expenses were primarily offset by lower incentive compensation expense. International non-GAAP SG&A was $158 million or 23.9% of revenue versus $164 million or 23.5% of revenue last year. The $6 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by the impact of new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 20.1% compared to 20% last year. Versus our guidance, the effective tax rate was approximately 250 basis point better than expected which was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the quarter in line with our expectations. We returned a total of $232 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $98 million and dividends of $134 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. As we announced last quarter, we intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. In the first quarter, we adopted a new standard for lease accounting. The most significant impact of adoption was the recognition of operating lease assets of $2.7 billion and operating lease liabilities of $2.8 billion, respectively. The standard does not materially affect our consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our original full year guidance provided last quarter reflected our estimated impact from the List 3 tariffs at 10%. Today, we are reiterating that guidance. It balances our better-than-expected Q1 earnings, the fact that it is early in the year and our best estimate of the impact associated with the recent increase in tariffs on goods imported from China. Specifically, I am referring to the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% on the products on the $200 billion List 3 that originally went into effect last September. Our fiscal 2020 guidance does not incorporate a List 4. As a reminder, our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes enterprise revenue in the range of $42.9 billion to $43.9 billion and enterprise comparable sales of 0.5% to 2.5%. This topline growth expectation is on top of the best two year stack in 14 years and reflects factors such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 4.6%, which is flat to fiscal 2019's rate and reflects our focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.65. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. I would like to reiterate the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance that we shared last quarter. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, technology and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. Although there will be variations between quarters, our outlook for the full year assumes gross profit as a percent of revenue will be approximately flat to fiscal 2019 as continued investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are offset by the higher margin rate of GreatCall. SG&A dollars are expected to grow as a percentage in the low single digits and be approximately flat as a percent of revenue to fiscal 2019. Increased expenses of GreatCall and continued investments in technology and wages are expected to be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2020 expectations. For the second quarter specifically, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.5 billion to $9.6 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.95 to $1, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 269 million shares. I would like to provide a few notes of color for Q2. We expect our Q2 gross profit rate to expand slightly versus last year. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the low to mid single digits. This increase in SG&A is expected to come primarily from the higher GreatCall operating expenses and increased advertising spend. Although the higher SG&A will be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, the benefit versus last year is anticipated to be considerably lower than the year-over-year benefit we realized in Q1. Lastly, the acquisition of CST closed during Q2 and was funded with existing cash. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nHubert Joly: Good morning Brian.\nBrian Nagel: First off, congratulations to everyone on their new roles. Very well deserved.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So I wanted to ask you one question. I just want to talk about the lease-to-own please program, Hubert, you mentioned in your prepared comments, but you have started to roll this out now. I guess the question is, if you look at this program, how big could it be? And the consumer that you are serving with this, is it truly an incremental consumer to Best Buy? And how should we think about any financial implications to Best Buy from these sales?\nCorie Barry: Yes. So I will start and Hubert can pile on. I think what I would start with first is what we want to offer is a variety of customer purchase options. So I think that's really important and you know that. But I think it's important to start with, our branded credit card is already 25% of the business that we do. You can see that in any of our filings. So that's kind of our starting point in terms of customer purchase options. What we like then is adding Progressive on top of that because it's what you are digging at, there is another suite of customers who just might not be able to qualify for the branded cards or frankly might not want to and would like to look at something that's a little bit different. We are seeing so far that the customers that engage with this program do think of the incremental to Best Buy and so they are not customers who would be necessarily, for the most part, maybe seen before or haven't certainly seen in a while. And you heard in our prepared remarks, we have now rolled out to almost 700 stores, 689. So that's two-thirds right now. We are hoping that by the end of the year, we can go out to another nine states before holiday. And so that will get us significantly across our store base. We are not sizing it right now and because we are still rolling, we are learning a lot even as we roll. Like we said in our prepared remarks, we rolled halfway through the quarter. And one of the things we know for sure is that as the stores are on the program longer, they become more and more proficient around the program. And so you know, we like what we are seeing. We feel like we really are addressing a customer need, very in line with the strategy and that we are providing a whole another suite of purchase option and we will continue to see how it grows over time.\nBrian Nagel: Perfect. Thank you very much. And congratulations.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joseph Feldman of Telsey.\nJoseph Feldman: Yes. Hi guys. Good morning and congratulations to everybody. I just wanted to ask, I noticed inventory was up a little bit. Is anything going on there that you can talk about? Maybe it's just bringing in goods ahead of the tariff list? Or just ready for the spring or anything with that?\nCorie Barry: Thank you Joe. A little bit more of the latter, honestly. Because if you think about when the tariffs going out, it was actually very close to the end of our quarter. And so this is really about us making sure we felt we have a good position heading into Memorial Day and then Father's Day and really light in a couple of spots last year. And so, as a team we had the opportunity to bring inventory to make sure we were well set. The other thing I would say, I am incredibly impressed by our merchant demand planning team and the health of the inventory is some of the best that we have ever seen. We have very low [indiscernible] left right now and we have been moving to the inventory nicely. So really nothing to read into there, just preparing for what is that string of kind of secondary holidays that happened during 2Q.\nJoseph Feldman: Got it. Thanks. And then, I know you mentioned that part of the SG&A maybe being up a little bit in the second quarter. You talked about ad expenses being a little higher. Is there a different strategy that you guys are employing this year ago to after some of those like Father's Day, graduation, holidays? Or what would be the reason for that?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I think we have liked so far what we have seen in some of our newer brand positioning. And you are absolutely right, if we are going to over-index in a quarter, Q2 makes a lot of sense given the string of secondary holidays we have. You have got Memorial Day. You have got Father's Day, the Fourth of July, even head into prime day later. And so you have got a whole string here and we feel like if we are going to over index and prefer a return on that spend, this is the right period of time for us to do it. And we can lift up some new and refreshed brand messaging. And so we felt like it is an important time of the year for us push a few more of our chips in on that.\nJoseph Feldman: That's helpful. Thanks and good luck with this quarter, guys.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. Mr. Baker. Your line is open. It appears Mr. Baker has stepped away from the phone. We will go to our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi. Good morning. Hubert, I have a feeling that my name gets like that. I think it happened on the first call that you did a long time ago. So my first question or I guess my only question is, anything surprised you about sales in the first quarter with regard to cadence, with regard to categories? And just drilling into the computing and mobile category, can we talk about laptops, desktop trends? And then anything with mobile as far as replacement rate, uptake in the category in general? Thank you.\nCorie Barry: So on the overall sales cadence, it actually played relatively closely to how we thought. If you remember, how we kind of set up the quarter we said, we felt like the consumer environment remains relatively favorable and I think most metrics would point to that continuing to be a good environment. We did have a little bit of pause around tax refunds that we mentioned. And if you remember, when we were into the quarter, refunds both quantity and amount were down about 40% and we said we were still gauging how much of that will come back. You ended up based on the IRS data with tax return total amount down about 2.4%. So we think that probably is like just a little bit of softness in this quarter, which again was kind of in line with how we guided for the quarter. And it is important to note, we also and we said we saw a softer than expected revenue in international. Now that's very much tied to the macro environment there. You can see that GDP is down in Canada and oil prices are struggling. And so you have got a bunch of things happening there that we think are more macro side. But in general, that wasn't anything that was an outlier. In terms of the computing and mobile business, I am going to take those a little bit separately. Computing, we kind of look at computing and tablets together. We talk about tablets as being an area of strength but it's a lot of the higher end, higher processing power, big gun kind of tablets which you can imagine you look at in light of computing. We didn't see a major change in trajectory there as we think about those categories together. A little bit more strength on the tablet side, a little bit less on the computing side. But we can see people making trade-offs between those two spaces. From our mobile perspective, that was actually just a slightly bit better than we thought it would be but it was still down year-over-year. And so again that's a category where we have said for a while, we kind of have some moderate expectations around growth there. It's definitely maturing and we continue to see a highly penetrated category, where there is a kind new reasons to buy.\nSimeon Gutman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So Total Tech Support seems to have some nice momentum lately in terms of enrollments and some healthy renewal rates based on our work. Could you just spend some time talking about the bigger picture here and the behavior of a typical Total Tech Support member since you rolled out the program acknowledging the fact that the initiative is still new? So when you are looking at the data, are you able to see a lift in the number of categories that these customers shop after joining or an increase in the number of visits to the store or better online engagement or anything along those trends? And I guess related to that, when do you typically see a ramp in any of these changes? Is it after they utilize the membership a few times or after they renew their membership or some other guidepost? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Absolutely. So first, I am just going to take one step back and say, the most important thing around Total Tech Support is, we strategically like the relationship it helps us build with our customers. Now what's tricky is that we are just now lapping our nationwide rollout of Total Tech Support. So we are just starting to see in a larger quantity what do renewal rates look like, what does customer behavior look like over a year. And again, with us, it's a little trickier because our customers tend to have lower frequency overall than some other retailers. So it takes us a long way to figure out what are the longer term customer behavioral implications. We talked a little bit about it on the last call. We are definitely seeing nice usage upfront in the program. And renewal rates have stuck at the levels we thought they would. And so we are seeing usage in line with what we thought. We are seeing renewal rates in line with what we thought. We are seeing a ton of surprises but we just don't have a lot of data on yet is, is it pushing more purchase behavior, is it keeping people engaged with Best Buy longer. We just need a little bit longer on the program to be able to give you some more information and data around that. In terms of what we see when we try to ramp programs like this, as you can imagine, it's not just about ramping the program because that has proficiency implications with how we sell at the store. Our associates have done an amazing job really learning about this program and then helping customers see the true benefit of it. It's a very different service sale than anything we have done historically. And I think our associates have learned a lot over the last year and continue to just get better and better helping a customer understand why this would be perfect for them. I think the other thing that we are also behind the scene were continuously trying to improve the customer experience, both from a digital perspective, how I can sell, how I can see what I have, how I can look up how to repair something myself, but also importantly from how we help you, how we prioritize your service visits and how we make sure we are helping you in the moment as quickly as possible. And so I think you are going to continue to see a ramp in performance here and it's not just proficiency. It's also how do we continue to add customer value propositions behind the scene that makes us more and more palatable for customers as a way to stay engaged with Best Buy.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gregory Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGregory Melich: Great. Thanks Hubert. Thanks for everything over the years. And Corie, my congratulations, well deserved.\nHubert Joly: Thank you.\nGregory Melich: So no good dead goes unpunished. Thank you for the tariff information. If you were to look at List 4 now, what percentage of your COGS would that be? It was nice to have the 7% on the current list, but could you help us on that front? And then I have a follow-up.\nCorie Barry: So I think the trick with List 4 is that it hasn't actually, it hasn't been defined. It hasn't even got into place yet. There's a lot of discussions that Hubert alluded to in his opening statement around what exactly will be included on that list and when it will go into implementation. And so it's very difficult right now, given the amount of change that's happening in that list for us to size it at this point and we haven't come out yet with any sizing on that list. I think Hubert, you might have something to add.\nHubert Joly: Yes. Greg, what I would highlight is that the administration is going to be going through a process of listening. And as said in my prepared remarks, no decision has been made. I think Secretary Mnuchin yesterday made a comment about the fact that he is going to be very attentive to the impact on consumers. So this is a complex discussion. No decision has been made. Even when decisions will be made, what rate will be applied, to what products, when, the when is going to be very important and then of course, we have always assumed that this negotiation process with China would not be linear. And so there is a meeting at the end of June and so rather than trying to forecast something, I think that our actions today are to be engaged in the discussion process. We would like to be as helpful as we can in support of the administration goals to minimize the impact on U.S. consumers. So expect us to be very active on this front in the future to be helpful.\nGregory Melich: Yes. Maybe given your experience with the washing machine and laundry product tariffs, maybe take us through what you think, how that played out and the impact on consumers and any sort of demand response? If you can glean anything from that, that would be helpful.\nCorie Barry: Yes. So the appliances tariff is tricky, specifically washing machines and definitely the price increases were certainly, to begin with, passed on directly. Units did decline, but that impact was offset somewhat by higher prices. The hard part is, I would not try to drive comparisons with that category, because that's a category, you go buy a washing machine because of duress or need and it doesn't have the same elasticity as some of the other products that we sell. And so I don't think that's a great indicator of how behaviorally people will respond, especially at the different levels of 10% to 25%, I think you are going to end up with potentially some different consumer buying behaviors.\nGregory Melich: And also across more categories, right, because ultimately people have to make decisions. All right. Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck to all of you and congrats.\nHubert Joly: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to talk about the demand you have seen over the years for appliances, home theater, smart home, et cetera? And could you walk us through just how much of your business you believe is related or tied to housing? Whether you see that as a headwind today? And maybe talk about how you see home services fitting into this ecosystem? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yes. So actually, we have done some correlations with how it, we actually don't have a super high correlation to housing. Some of those individual categories might have a slightly higher correlation, but we don't tend to have a very large one in total. In terms of how we see services playing with those categories, definitely as we have grown larger TV and large appliances, we have seen services like installation, delivery, those type of services expands materially as we have been able to grow those businesses. And so I think even part of what you are seeing and the reason people like Total Tech Support is, it can help them with some of those delivery and installation experiences as they are buying these larger products. And so the nice part is, we haven't seen kind of correlations right now in our business to housing and we continue to see nice results in those categories.\nHubert Joly: And what I would add, Corie, is it's above and beyond what the market does, which we continue to be very excited about and that's the essence of our strategy, the opportunity to deepen the relationships with our customers. We have highlighted at our Investor Day back in 2017 that our share of wallet of existing customers was around a quarter and a lot of the initiatives we have underway are designed to strengthen and deepen and broaden the relationship with these customers. And when you have a relatively low market share, which we think is our case, then you are excited about the upside from increasing that penetration which could very much outweigh any kind of short term situation in the underlying macro.\nZach Fadem: I appreciate the color and congratulations as well.\nHubert Joly: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Mushkin: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a question on, I guess more of a two-part. Sales drivers, I want to talk about the back half of the year. How you guys are thinking of what can maybe move the needle as we get into back half? But then I want to think more long term and kind of looking out how we should view some of the strategic initiatives like GreatCall, CST, In-Home Advisor, Total Tech Support, the move to 5G in relation to kind of how you guys are thinking about your longer term sales growth rate? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yes. So we will start with the back half. Definitely, some of the consistent sales drivers that we have even seen coming in to the first part of the year here, we continue to see appliances as an ongoing opportunity for us and feel very well situated there. There continues to be interesting innovation in some of the other categories like what we are seeing in smart home and what we are even seeing in innovation. And you can see the different categories at different times. A new wave of tablets creates new interest. Some of the new in-home automation products creates new interest. Some of the new TV even evolutions, continued penetration in 4K and even the ability to see 8K and some of the new technologies, that continue to drive interest. And so I think this combination of continued strength in some of the underlying categories like appliances and then a continued evolution of technology in a few of the other categories, we continue to see a lot of interest in the products that we carry. Importantly, as we look ahead, I will spend just a moment on health. And we have said from day one, even when we had our Investor Day, health is a bit of a longer term value driver for us. But we absolutely like what we are starting to see in health. And if I just take you back for a second to why is it that we think we are uniquely well-positioned in this space and why is it that we built the relationship with GreatCall, I think importantly, number one, we have always said, we feel like it's very in line with our strategy. It addresses that key human need question around health and wellness. And in particular for us, when we are really trying to get pointed around our purpose, this is a very important purpose question around helping older Americans live a more independent life in their homes with the help of technology which aligns very well to what we are trying to accomplish overall. That space is exciting. There are 50 million people over 65 and that number is going to grow more than 50% in the next 20 years. And so you have a real population of people who would like to have some help. And then with GreatCall, we felt like we really acquired a great asset with already 900,000 members and already a good profitable business. I think importantly, between the two companies now what we are seeing is that, we jointly bring to life a number of really interesting value creation opportunities. We are the only place that has that a nationwide footprint of in-home capabilities around technology as well as importantly the support backbone that keep those things running over time. We are agnostic across ecosystems. So we will help you with whatever technology you already have or whatever technology you want to put in. And as we bring on GreatCall's assets, their ability to help us with the human touch combined with more predictive analytics, it becomes very powerful because then you not only start to see major medical events might happen, but we have some of that human intervention that also is helpful. And so I think we are continuing to build on that thesis and I think you can hear us every time we talk to, we get a little bit more clear about the space that we play in that we feel like no one else can. That being said, it's going to take us some time to continue to build the capabilities and then to build the footprint. Right now we just have a few small kind of publicly announced partnerships with Senior Whole Health of Massachusetts and long-term care insurance of CNA, which is one of the largest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurance companies. So those are couple of small proof points and we are going to continue to try to build on those over time. I think that's likely a longer term thesis for us, but a very exciting one in terms of a unique space where we have capabilities. As I think about other growth mechanisms like 5G, I might actually turn it over to Mike and ask him to add a little color to what we think that could do for us.\nMike Mohan: Hi Scott, it's Mike. You brought up IHA and 5G and they both apply in different ways, but we think there's some good excitement. I will start with IHA. We already know it's an incremental part to our business and it just helps us build a deeper relationship with our customers and expand the share of wallet. And so as I look at that going forward, it's an area we think we just started, we are in the first few innings of what that could look like to drive a longer and deeper relationships with customers across a whole host of products and services. When I think about 5G, it's a place where we are really in a good spot to help our carrier partners and OEMs bring new technology solutions to life, because this one's being roll out market by market and you are going to need an environment where you can actually get into people's homes, get into people's businesses with qualified and trained teams and then use our stores for opportunities to showcase what's possible with a higher network speed. So we are optimistic about it. It's just starting and we think it's going to be a great journey to be participating.\nHubert Joly: And then of course in terms of specific numbers, that's why we have this meeting in September in Q3, where the team will have the opportunity to try to update long term prospects and that's something we had announced on our call at the end of February.\nScott Mushkin: Great guys. I look forward to the meeting. It sounds like we could see some sales acceleration. So I do look forward to the meeting. And I offer my congratulations too. It's just a wonderful group of people and look forward to the next chapter. Thanks.\nHubert Joly: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Unfortunately, I do have another tariff question. Corie, you have highlighted that tariffs were expected to impact about 7% of your COGS. I guess what I am trying to figure out is, of that 7% exposure, can you help us understand how much of your mitigation process was handled or managed through vendor negotiation basically pushing that price increase, if you will, back on to vendors? And how much was handled through you guys having to increase prices, just so we can kind of think about how the forward tariffs may work? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yes. So I will try to give some color. We talked last time about some of the ways that we are going to try to mitigate tariff. And we broke that into a few buckets. In some cases, we obviously have worldwide vendors, who might make some decisions to push that across their whole worldwide business. In some cases, we also know that we have vendors who would absorb costs as a way to retain some of the business. And then in some cases, we have people are already moving supply chains, moving the business around, finding other ways to bring things. And then finally, there is the question of increasing cost. I think what's difficult is at 10% for that List 3, you have a much greater ability to influence using a variety of methods and even the absorbing method becomes easier because at 10% and you are not sure if it's an extended period of time or a limited period of time, you might be willing to absorb that. As you move to 25%, the discussion becomes quite different because there is a much lower likelihood that you can absorb that as a vendor completely and you have to really think differently about how quickly you can actually move your distribution. And it takes longer in the consumer electronic space. And so I wouldn't say that what we have seen in the 10% where I think we haven't seen as much of an impact is applicable to the 25%, Hubert said at the prepared remarks, at 25% level, there will be higher prices for consumers. Now it's tricky and I think you have heard it from variety of retailers is figuring out SKU by SKU, vendor by vendor which of those tactics are going to work and which aren't and then how that will actually play into the back half. So that's the work the team is doing and definitely we did our very best to try to size it. But there's still a lot of work to do there.\nHubert Joly: And I certainly want to comment the skills of our merchant teams. Of course, given the size of the U.S. market, size of Best Buy in those markets, these teams do a wonderful job of navigating these waters and that's one of the, when I talked about the depths and breadth of talent at the company, that's clearly one of the areas where we have wonderful assets. And looking at the clock and this is not only my last call as CEO, but the last minutes of my last call as CEO and before we have to call it, I will quickly say this, I am clearly passing the baton, which is a French word, to Corie and our team with a very happy and full heart and with a strong conviction that the right team is in place for this pivotal moment in Best Buy's history and I very much look forward to watching Corie and her team do their magic. And so my thanks to all of you. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hubert Joly",
            "content": "Thank you Mollie and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for what is my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. As you know, we made an exciting announcement last month. On June 11, Corie Barry will become the fifth CEO in Best Buy's 53 year history. At that time, I will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman of the Board. Also, Mike Mohan role will be elevated as he moves from being our domestic Chief Operating Officer to the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. I am very proud of the seamless transition we have decided to implement as it reflects positively on our momentum as well as on our focus on executive development and succession planning. It is clearly designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity and I am grateful to the members of our Board of Directors for their diligence and care in overseeing this critical process. Before I share more thoughts on our leadership transition, let me first review our quarterly performance and provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our financial results and outlook. So Q1 was a strong quarter and a good start to the year. We reported $9.14 billion in revenue and grew our enterprise comparable sales by 1.1%, which was at the high end of our guidance. We also delivered better-than-expected profitability. We expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 50 basis points and delivered on non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.02, which was up 24% compared to the first quarter of last year. I want to thank our associates across the company for their hard work and dedication in delivering these strong results. Before I discuss the progress we made on our Best Buy 2020 strategy, I would like to share some brief thoughts on tariffs on goods from China. First, let me say that the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. They have done this in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors. Second, -- [AUDIO GAP] Okay. We are sorry for the interruption because of and I apologize for that, technical issue. I will recommence my comments with when I started to talk about tariffs and tariffs on goods from China. So what I was saying is that first, the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. And they have done is in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors. Second, no decision has been made by the administration at this point on the actual implementation of tariffs on additional product categories. There is a comprehensive process the administration will be going through to take inputs and we intend to be actively engaged in this process to help the administration continue to minimize the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers. In addition, there is time for the trade negotiations to progress before any decision gets made. As Corie will discuss, our fiscal 2020 guidance incorporates the estimated impact of the recent move from 10% to 25% tariffs on this List 3. As a reminder, we estimate that List 3, which is the $200 billion list that went into effect last September is only about 7% of our total annual cost of goods sold. Many of the products on this list are accessories. And while we understand List 4 as proposed is comprised of many consumer items, including many electronics, we think it is premature to speculate on the impact of further tariffs as it is unclear whether List 4 will actually be implemented, what products would ultimately be included, at what rates and when. But one thing is of course certain as other retailers have noted the impact of tariffs at 25% will result in price increases and will be shelled by U.S. consumers. We will of course continue to work to minimize the impact of the trade negotiations on U.S. consumers and will continue to update you on this matter. Now let me update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives with technology and further develop our competitive differentiation. In health, we continue to make progress, both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Our focus is to enable seniors to live longer in their homes and help reduce their healthcare costs. We believe that the combination of technology and our human touch provided through the ability to access and engage people in their home is a highly relevant and differentiated proposition. We are excited to continue to build our capabilities to support the growth of this business. First, we will be opening a third GreatCall caring center in October. The center, located in San Antonio, Texas with 400 care agents and provide 24x7 technical phone support, concierge services and urgent response services to customers. Second, this month we have required a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST to help scale the commercial monitoring business. CST has approximately 100,000 senior subscribers. Some of [indiscernible] services as a supplemental benefits under their Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage under Medicare Advantage plans is helpful to growing our commercial business because it allows us to engage with insurers and build our service into their plans as a way to both improve their member experience and help them save on costs. The acquisition of CST will thereby help facilitate our access to in penetration of the commercial market. We are excited about the prospects of combining CST's services and relationships with the existing GreatCall business. More broadly, this tuck-in acquisition, together with GreatCall, complements our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better serve both the seniors in their home and those who support them like payors and providers. During Q1, we also continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We continue to grow the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to drive the customer experience. Another first quarter example of how we are expanding what we do for customers is the rollout of our lease-to-own program. The financing provided through our Best Buy credit card is an important benefit we offer customers where there are people who are going to be interested in getting a credit card who are unable to quantify for it because of low credit scores or in many cases, simply no credit history. Our lease-to-own program provides another option for enabling customers to make periodic payments over a fixed period eventually leading to full ownership of the product once the agreement has been fulfilled. During the quarter, we launched the offer across 36 states or about 70% of our stores and expect to roll it out to another nine states later this year. Customers are using the option to acquire products across a wide variety of categories with the largest being computing. In addition, we found during the pilot that a significant number of customers are choosing to pick advantage of Progressive Leasing's 90-day purchase option, which consist of a $79 initial payment plus the retail price. The offering is consistent with our strategy to enrich lives through technology by opening up the experiences that we offer to new customers that might not otherwise have the chance to acquire the kind of solutions that we sell. In many cases, it will allow us to catch customers early on in their credit history and build a relationship with them over time. In addition to expanding what we do for customers, we are continuing to evolve the way we interact with our customers across their homes, our stores and digitally. As we mentioned during our last call, we are developing a holistic home strategy to leverage all of the ways we currently interact with customers in their home to create meaningful relationships and further differentiate Best Buy. Our in-home consultation program is one of the ways that we deliver experiences in the home today. The program continues to build and it is clear there is a real customer need we are addressing. And from a financial standpoint, we continue to see higher revenue per order and higher gross profit from these interactions in the store and online. We expect to add a similar number of advisors this year as we did last year, which would put us around 700 advisors at the end of the year. In addition, we are working to enhance the productivity of our advisors, but eliminating manual processes so that they can focus more time on their customers. For example, starting this quarter we will begin automating our proposal and client telling processes and enable the ability for customers to chat online real-time with their advisor. I would also like to say a few words about how we are transforming our supply chain to improve the experience for our customers. When we laid out a multiyear plan at our Investor Day in 2017, we shared our belief that the vast majority of our assortment need to be available anywhere you wanted the next day at the latest. Through a combination of initiatives including expanded partnerships, the deployment of metro e-commerce centers across key cities and automation, we continue to improve our speed of delivery to customers and expand next-day and same-day delivery options. As we shared last quarter, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. In addition, we offer next-day delivery options in 60 metro areas on orders over $35 for free with no membership fees. In fact, customers can order as late as 8 P.M. in Los Angeles and New York City and 5:30 P.M. in the other metro areas and will get their package delivered the next day. 77% of Best Buy customers are in a ZIP Code where we are able to offer this service today and thousands of SKUs are eligible. In addition to our various shipping options, all of our customers also have the extremely convenient option to pick up their products in our stores within one hour of placing their order. Even with all the improved shipping options and enhancements available to our customers, they are increasingly choosing to pick up their products in one of our nearly 1,000 stores. And so in-store pickup of online orders is now about 40% of our online revenue and growing. Automation is an important part of our supply chain transformation and starting in Q4 of last year, we have been rolling out new automating boxing technology in our distribution center that builds real-time custom boxes for products coming down a conveyor belt. Earlier this year, Barron's named Best Buy number one on its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies. And this cutting-edge boxing technology is an example of our sustainability efforts. In addition to driving productivity, it reduces environmental waste by eliminating excess corrugated cardboard and all-plastic packaging fillers. Overall our supply chain strategy is to leverage our assets of stores, distribution centers and metro e-commerce centers in a portfolio approach. That allows us to optimize speed, convenience and cost to meet customer needs at the right time and place. We are still in the midst of this multiyear transformation, but we like where we are and where we are going. Of course, we also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures. During the first quarter, we achieved $35 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $575 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. Before I turn the call over to Corie, I would now like to say a few words about our upcoming management transition and my excitement about the future of our company. The choice of timing of the CEO transition is probably more of an art than a science. I personally felt it was the right time for me to trigger this leadership transition for several reasons. First, I had felt we had achieved what I had hoped to accomplish when I joined on the company in 2012. I am proud of what we have delivered for customers, our employees, our vendors, our shareholders and our communities. Second, I felt we had built the depth and breadth of talent necessary to carry Best Buy into the future. Last September, we put in place a new leadership organization by elevating Corie and Mike to new roles with greater responsibilities. In the time since then, I have been very impressed by the effectiveness of our team and these leaders. Third, with a clear an exciting purpose to enrich lives with technology, we set out two years ago to implement a strategy focused on addressing key human needs in entertainment, productivity, communication, food, security and health and wellness. We have essentially achieved fiscal 2021 revenue and non-GAAP operating income target two years ahead of plan. And while we still have a lot to do from a transformation standpoint, it is clear that we are on the right path. Fourth, we have announced plans to host a meeting with the investment community later this year. I thought it was important that the leaders who stand in front of this audience to lay out our roadmap for the future with a team that is responsible for carrying that strategy forward. So in my new role, I will of course continue to lead the Board of Directors. I will also advise and support Corie on key matters such as strategy, capability building, M&A and external relationships. In addition, I will assume certain responsibilities at Corie's request in areas like government affairs, community relations and leadership development. In closing, let me say that I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us and confidence in the team we have built as well as our talents, culture, heart and soul. I look forward to continuing to work with Corie, the team and the Board in my new role manual to help them strategy and transformation with one goal in mind fulfilling our purpose to enrich lives with technology, doing well by doing good. And I want to thank you, our shareholders and journalists who cover, for your support over the past several years, I have thoroughly enjoyed our ongoing dialogue. Our interactions have not only been stimulating, but it has challenged us to be better as a management team and as a company. And likewise, I want to thank my colleagues for our collaboration and their friendship. Working together, we turned around and then began going this wonderful company. It has been the honor of my professional life to work with all of you as we did this. The company is in good hands with our new leadership and the best of talents we have. And I am confident that the journey we began in 2012 will continue well into the years ahead. And now, I am very excited to turn the call over to our CFO and future CEO, Corie Barry. Good morning Brian. Thank you. Yes. Greg, what I would highlight is that the administration is going to be going through a process of listening. And as said in my prepared remarks, no decision has been made. I think Secretary Mnuchin yesterday made a comment about the fact that he is going to be very attentive to the impact on consumers. So this is a complex discussion. No decision has been made. Even when decisions will be made, what rate will be applied, to what products, when, the when is going to be very important and then of course, we have always assumed that this negotiation process with China would not be linear. And so there is a meeting at the end of June and so rather than trying to forecast something, I think that our actions today are to be engaged in the discussion process. We would like to be as helpful as we can in support of the administration goals to minimize the impact on U.S. consumers. So expect us to be very active on this front in the future to be helpful. Thank you. And what I would add, Corie, is it's above and beyond what the market does, which we continue to be very excited about and that's the essence of our strategy, the opportunity to deepen the relationships with our customers. We have highlighted at our Investor Day back in 2017 that our share of wallet of existing customers was around a quarter and a lot of the initiatives we have underway are designed to strengthen and deepen and broaden the relationship with these customers. And when you have a relatively low market share, which we think is our case, then you are excited about the upside from increasing that penetration which could very much outweigh any kind of short term situation in the underlying macro. Thank you. And then of course in terms of specific numbers, that's why we have this meeting in September in Q3, where the team will have the opportunity to try to update long term prospects and that's something we had announced on our call at the end of February. Thank you. And I certainly want to comment the skills of our merchant teams. Of course, given the size of the U.S. market, size of Best Buy in those markets, these teams do a wonderful job of navigating these waters and that's one of the, when I talked about the depths and breadth of talent at the company, that's clearly one of the areas where we have wonderful assets. And looking at the clock and this is not only my last call as CEO, but the last minutes of my last call as CEO and before we have to call it, I will quickly say this, I am clearly passing the baton, which is a French word, to Corie and our team with a very happy and full heart and with a strong conviction that the right team is in place for this pivotal moment in Best Buy's history and I very much look forward to watching Corie and her team do their magic. And so my thanks to all of you. Have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning everyone. I am deeply grateful to Hubert and the rest of the Board of Directors for their confidence in me and their clear belief that this leadership evolution is in the best interests of Best Buy and all its stakeholders. Nearly seven years ago, the Board made a stunningly good decision when they asked a Frenchman with no retail experience to save this company and he brought his remarkable brain, boundless energy and deep passion to the job. My personal gratitude to Hubert knows no limits and I am delighted to have him nearby to call upon for advice and counsel in his new role as Executive Chair. As I think about my new role, I could not be more fortunate to have Mike Mohan at my side as our President and COO. I have worked closely with Mike for the past 15 years and I am so excited to continue to work with him and the rest of the leadership team in this next chapter as we implement the strategy that we helped build together. As far as my successor in the CFO role, we are in the midst of the search process for a new Chief Financial Officer. Now on to the Q1 financial details. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.14 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02. The EPS result exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the high end of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to a higher gross profit rate and strong expense management. The lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.03 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $9.14 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.1%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 24% to $1.02. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income, which was driven by lower incentive compensation and a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 0.8% to $8.48 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.3% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 105 Best Buy mobile and 12 large-format store code closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances which includes both major and small appliances, wearables and tablets. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our entertainment category. Domestic online revenue of $1.31 billion was 15.4% of domestic revenue, up from 13.6% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 14.5% on top of 12% growth in the first quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue decreased 5.2% to $661 million. This was primarily driven by approximately 390 basis points of negative foreign currency impact and a comparable sales decline of 1.2%. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by positive comparable sales in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 23.7%. The domestic gross profit rate was 23.7% versus 23.3% last year. The 40 basis point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall's higher gross profit rate and improved product margin rates, which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiative. These favorable items were partially offset by higher supply chain costs. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 80 basis points to 24.2%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which included improved gross profit rates in several product categories and increased revenue in the higher margin rate services category. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.82 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which decreased $5 million and 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.66 billion or 19.6% of revenue versus 19.7% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year as GreatCall operating expenses were primarily offset by lower incentive compensation expense. International non-GAAP SG&A was $158 million or 23.9% of revenue versus $164 million or 23.5% of revenue last year. The $6 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by the impact of new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 20.1% compared to 20% last year. Versus our guidance, the effective tax rate was approximately 250 basis point better than expected which was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the quarter in line with our expectations. We returned a total of $232 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $98 million and dividends of $134 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. As we announced last quarter, we intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. In the first quarter, we adopted a new standard for lease accounting. The most significant impact of adoption was the recognition of operating lease assets of $2.7 billion and operating lease liabilities of $2.8 billion, respectively. The standard does not materially affect our consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our original full year guidance provided last quarter reflected our estimated impact from the List 3 tariffs at 10%. Today, we are reiterating that guidance. It balances our better-than-expected Q1 earnings, the fact that it is early in the year and our best estimate of the impact associated with the recent increase in tariffs on goods imported from China. Specifically, I am referring to the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% on the products on the $200 billion List 3 that originally went into effect last September. Our fiscal 2020 guidance does not incorporate a List 4. As a reminder, our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes enterprise revenue in the range of $42.9 billion to $43.9 billion and enterprise comparable sales of 0.5% to 2.5%. This topline growth expectation is on top of the best two year stack in 14 years and reflects factors such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 4.6%, which is flat to fiscal 2019's rate and reflects our focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.65. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. I would like to reiterate the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance that we shared last quarter. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, technology and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. Although there will be variations between quarters, our outlook for the full year assumes gross profit as a percent of revenue will be approximately flat to fiscal 2019 as continued investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are offset by the higher margin rate of GreatCall. SG&A dollars are expected to grow as a percentage in the low single digits and be approximately flat as a percent of revenue to fiscal 2019. Increased expenses of GreatCall and continued investments in technology and wages are expected to be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2020 expectations. For the second quarter specifically, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.5 billion to $9.6 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.95 to $1, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 269 million shares. I would like to provide a few notes of color for Q2. We expect our Q2 gross profit rate to expand slightly versus last year. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the low to mid single digits. This increase in SG&A is expected to come primarily from the higher GreatCall operating expenses and increased advertising spend. Although the higher SG&A will be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, the benefit versus last year is anticipated to be considerably lower than the year-over-year benefit we realized in Q1. Lastly, the acquisition of CST closed during Q2 and was funded with existing cash. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Yes. So I will start and Hubert can pile on. I think what I would start with first is what we want to offer is a variety of customer purchase options. So I think that's really important and you know that. But I think it's important to start with, our branded credit card is already 25% of the business that we do. You can see that in any of our filings. So that's kind of our starting point in terms of customer purchase options. What we like then is adding Progressive on top of that because it's what you are digging at, there is another suite of customers who just might not be able to qualify for the branded cards or frankly might not want to and would like to look at something that's a little bit different. We are seeing so far that the customers that engage with this program do think of the incremental to Best Buy and so they are not customers who would be necessarily, for the most part, maybe seen before or haven't certainly seen in a while. And you heard in our prepared remarks, we have now rolled out to almost 700 stores, 689. So that's two-thirds right now. We are hoping that by the end of the year, we can go out to another nine states before holiday. And so that will get us significantly across our store base. We are not sizing it right now and because we are still rolling, we are learning a lot even as we roll. Like we said in our prepared remarks, we rolled halfway through the quarter. And one of the things we know for sure is that as the stores are on the program longer, they become more and more proficient around the program. And so you know, we like what we are seeing. We feel like we really are addressing a customer need, very in line with the strategy and that we are providing a whole another suite of purchase option and we will continue to see how it grows over time. Thank you. Thank you Joe. A little bit more of the latter, honestly. Because if you think about when the tariffs going out, it was actually very close to the end of our quarter. And so this is really about us making sure we felt we have a good position heading into Memorial Day and then Father's Day and really light in a couple of spots last year. And so, as a team we had the opportunity to bring inventory to make sure we were well set. The other thing I would say, I am incredibly impressed by our merchant demand planning team and the health of the inventory is some of the best that we have ever seen. We have very low [indiscernible] left right now and we have been moving to the inventory nicely. So really nothing to read into there, just preparing for what is that string of kind of secondary holidays that happened during 2Q. Yes. I think we have liked so far what we have seen in some of our newer brand positioning. And you are absolutely right, if we are going to over-index in a quarter, Q2 makes a lot of sense given the string of secondary holidays we have. You have got Memorial Day. You have got Father's Day, the Fourth of July, even head into prime day later. And so you have got a whole string here and we feel like if we are going to over index and prefer a return on that spend, this is the right period of time for us to do it. And we can lift up some new and refreshed brand messaging. And so we felt like it is an important time of the year for us push a few more of our chips in on that. Thank you. So on the overall sales cadence, it actually played relatively closely to how we thought. If you remember, how we kind of set up the quarter we said, we felt like the consumer environment remains relatively favorable and I think most metrics would point to that continuing to be a good environment. We did have a little bit of pause around tax refunds that we mentioned. And if you remember, when we were into the quarter, refunds both quantity and amount were down about 40% and we said we were still gauging how much of that will come back. You ended up based on the IRS data with tax return total amount down about 2.4%. So we think that probably is like just a little bit of softness in this quarter, which again was kind of in line with how we guided for the quarter. And it is important to note, we also and we said we saw a softer than expected revenue in international. Now that's very much tied to the macro environment there. You can see that GDP is down in Canada and oil prices are struggling. And so you have got a bunch of things happening there that we think are more macro side. But in general, that wasn't anything that was an outlier. In terms of the computing and mobile business, I am going to take those a little bit separately. Computing, we kind of look at computing and tablets together. We talk about tablets as being an area of strength but it's a lot of the higher end, higher processing power, big gun kind of tablets which you can imagine you look at in light of computing. We didn't see a major change in trajectory there as we think about those categories together. A little bit more strength on the tablet side, a little bit less on the computing side. But we can see people making trade-offs between those two spaces. From our mobile perspective, that was actually just a slightly bit better than we thought it would be but it was still down year-over-year. And so again that's a category where we have said for a while, we kind of have some moderate expectations around growth there. It's definitely maturing and we continue to see a highly penetrated category, where there is a kind new reasons to buy. Absolutely. So first, I am just going to take one step back and say, the most important thing around Total Tech Support is, we strategically like the relationship it helps us build with our customers. Now what's tricky is that we are just now lapping our nationwide rollout of Total Tech Support. So we are just starting to see in a larger quantity what do renewal rates look like, what does customer behavior look like over a year. And again, with us, it's a little trickier because our customers tend to have lower frequency overall than some other retailers. So it takes us a long way to figure out what are the longer term customer behavioral implications. We talked a little bit about it on the last call. We are definitely seeing nice usage upfront in the program. And renewal rates have stuck at the levels we thought they would. And so we are seeing usage in line with what we thought. We are seeing renewal rates in line with what we thought. We are seeing a ton of surprises but we just don't have a lot of data on yet is, is it pushing more purchase behavior, is it keeping people engaged with Best Buy longer. We just need a little bit longer on the program to be able to give you some more information and data around that. In terms of what we see when we try to ramp programs like this, as you can imagine, it's not just about ramping the program because that has proficiency implications with how we sell at the store. Our associates have done an amazing job really learning about this program and then helping customers see the true benefit of it. It's a very different service sale than anything we have done historically. And I think our associates have learned a lot over the last year and continue to just get better and better helping a customer understand why this would be perfect for them. I think the other thing that we are also behind the scene were continuously trying to improve the customer experience, both from a digital perspective, how I can sell, how I can see what I have, how I can look up how to repair something myself, but also importantly from how we help you, how we prioritize your service visits and how we make sure we are helping you in the moment as quickly as possible. And so I think you are going to continue to see a ramp in performance here and it's not just proficiency. It's also how do we continue to add customer value propositions behind the scene that makes us more and more palatable for customers as a way to stay engaged with Best Buy. Thanks. So I think the trick with List 4 is that it hasn't actually, it hasn't been defined. It hasn't even got into place yet. There's a lot of discussions that Hubert alluded to in his opening statement around what exactly will be included on that list and when it will go into implementation. And so it's very difficult right now, given the amount of change that's happening in that list for us to size it at this point and we haven't come out yet with any sizing on that list. I think Hubert, you might have something to add. Yes. So the appliances tariff is tricky, specifically washing machines and definitely the price increases were certainly, to begin with, passed on directly. Units did decline, but that impact was offset somewhat by higher prices. The hard part is, I would not try to drive comparisons with that category, because that's a category, you go buy a washing machine because of duress or need and it doesn't have the same elasticity as some of the other products that we sell. And so I don't think that's a great indicator of how behaviorally people will respond, especially at the different levels of 10% to 25%, I think you are going to end up with potentially some different consumer buying behaviors. Yes. So actually, we have done some correlations with how it, we actually don't have a super high correlation to housing. Some of those individual categories might have a slightly higher correlation, but we don't tend to have a very large one in total. In terms of how we see services playing with those categories, definitely as we have grown larger TV and large appliances, we have seen services like installation, delivery, those type of services expands materially as we have been able to grow those businesses. And so I think even part of what you are seeing and the reason people like Total Tech Support is, it can help them with some of those delivery and installation experiences as they are buying these larger products. And so the nice part is, we haven't seen kind of correlations right now in our business to housing and we continue to see nice results in those categories. Yes. So we will start with the back half. Definitely, some of the consistent sales drivers that we have even seen coming in to the first part of the year here, we continue to see appliances as an ongoing opportunity for us and feel very well situated there. There continues to be interesting innovation in some of the other categories like what we are seeing in smart home and what we are even seeing in innovation. And you can see the different categories at different times. A new wave of tablets creates new interest. Some of the new in-home automation products creates new interest. Some of the new TV even evolutions, continued penetration in 4K and even the ability to see 8K and some of the new technologies, that continue to drive interest. And so I think this combination of continued strength in some of the underlying categories like appliances and then a continued evolution of technology in a few of the other categories, we continue to see a lot of interest in the products that we carry. Importantly, as we look ahead, I will spend just a moment on health. And we have said from day one, even when we had our Investor Day, health is a bit of a longer term value driver for us. But we absolutely like what we are starting to see in health. And if I just take you back for a second to why is it that we think we are uniquely well-positioned in this space and why is it that we built the relationship with GreatCall, I think importantly, number one, we have always said, we feel like it's very in line with our strategy. It addresses that key human need question around health and wellness. And in particular for us, when we are really trying to get pointed around our purpose, this is a very important purpose question around helping older Americans live a more independent life in their homes with the help of technology which aligns very well to what we are trying to accomplish overall. That space is exciting. There are 50 million people over 65 and that number is going to grow more than 50% in the next 20 years. And so you have a real population of people who would like to have some help. And then with GreatCall, we felt like we really acquired a great asset with already 900,000 members and already a good profitable business. I think importantly, between the two companies now what we are seeing is that, we jointly bring to life a number of really interesting value creation opportunities. We are the only place that has that a nationwide footprint of in-home capabilities around technology as well as importantly the support backbone that keep those things running over time. We are agnostic across ecosystems. So we will help you with whatever technology you already have or whatever technology you want to put in. And as we bring on GreatCall's assets, their ability to help us with the human touch combined with more predictive analytics, it becomes very powerful because then you not only start to see major medical events might happen, but we have some of that human intervention that also is helpful. And so I think we are continuing to build on that thesis and I think you can hear us every time we talk to, we get a little bit more clear about the space that we play in that we feel like no one else can. That being said, it's going to take us some time to continue to build the capabilities and then to build the footprint. Right now we just have a few small kind of publicly announced partnerships with Senior Whole Health of Massachusetts and long-term care insurance of CNA, which is one of the largest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurance companies. So those are couple of small proof points and we are going to continue to try to build on those over time. I think that's likely a longer term thesis for us, but a very exciting one in terms of a unique space where we have capabilities. As I think about other growth mechanisms like 5G, I might actually turn it over to Mike and ask him to add a little color to what we think that could do for us. Thank you. Yes. So I will try to give some color. We talked last time about some of the ways that we are going to try to mitigate tariff. And we broke that into a few buckets. In some cases, we obviously have worldwide vendors, who might make some decisions to push that across their whole worldwide business. In some cases, we also know that we have vendors who would absorb costs as a way to retain some of the business. And then in some cases, we have people are already moving supply chains, moving the business around, finding other ways to bring things. And then finally, there is the question of increasing cost. I think what's difficult is at 10% for that List 3, you have a much greater ability to influence using a variety of methods and even the absorbing method becomes easier because at 10% and you are not sure if it's an extended period of time or a limited period of time, you might be willing to absorb that. As you move to 25%, the discussion becomes quite different because there is a much lower likelihood that you can absorb that as a vendor completely and you have to really think differently about how quickly you can actually move your distribution. And it takes longer in the consumer electronic space. And so I wouldn't say that what we have seen in the 10% where I think we haven't seen as much of an impact is applicable to the 25%, Hubert said at the prepared remarks, at 25% level, there will be higher prices for consumers. Now it's tricky and I think you have heard it from variety of retailers is figuring out SKU by SKU, vendor by vendor which of those tactics are going to work and which aren't and then how that will actually play into the back half. So that's the work the team is doing and definitely we did our very best to try to size it. But there's still a lot of work to do there."

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experience often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today we\u2019re reporting strong Q4 financial results which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%. We continue to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales, as almost two thirds of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38% and even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376% and our employees delivered more than 1 million units. From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theatre. As you recall, this year we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts to manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and evened out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3 after reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February. As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issue the industry has been seeing all year, we continue to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstripped supply across the industry as is well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter. As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial result. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shopped with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year. To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepared to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisors and video chats with our store associates. In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping support and fulfillment. This drove not only new users of the app, but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first time launches of the app were up almost 80% and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%. During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continue to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who were working on the front lines, and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leaves, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring, reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3-year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S employees will receive $500 as full time and $200 as part time or occasional seasonal. In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that weren't there needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. In all, the COVID related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic, support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they were working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds. We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. And we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed the climate pledge committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month, when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1000 largest public companies on five key stakeholder categories, shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet.  Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, help employees experiencing hardship, and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top five and the second time we have been in the number one position. As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the things we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It's too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our domestic -- online sales worth 43% of our domestic sales in fiscal '21. And we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor model, and how we spend our investment dollars. Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve four shopping needs; inspiration, research, convenience, and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big box retailer with a strong omni-channel presence to an omni-channel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment. Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them. In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs. As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance urgency for teams with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiatives. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results consolidating volume, using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time. In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse grade packaging station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduce selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market. As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal. As we look to the near-term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs, and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years, or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large format locations each of the past 2 years, and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates, and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This too was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes. Since the pandemic began, our overall headcount has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we have brought back about two thirds of them. As we approached the fourth quarter any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who were on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%. Even though headcount across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full time and part time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full time and not enough part time employees. As part of the process, part time roles were offered to many of the displaced full time employees who were interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 employees, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change and how customers want to shop with us. It is important to add that we are intent on rescaling and retraining employees wherever possible, so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy. As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there's been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking, and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs both online and in our stores. The proliferation of health related devices has become so great. We created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work-at-home as well. There's an influx of products around all aspects, from high tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor roadmaps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working at home experience. Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone. Of course our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator and advisors are inspiring technology solutions by a customer consultations happening in homes, digitally in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisors while shopping on samsung.com. On the support side, our Total Tech Support program continues to receive very strong customer rating, and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully press pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year. I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians have been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long-term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail, and build to connecting patients and physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease for example. The second area is active ageing, which includes device based emergency response and other services for generation A, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active ageing builds on the GreatCall CST and Biosensics acquisitions. The third focus area is virtual care, and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring, and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician. Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health we mean curated monitoring devices, packaged with the consumer in mind with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician. In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active ageing business and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform and our data analytics and intelligence engines. In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million towards this goal. In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose, and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined. And I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan both strategically and financially much further than we expected. While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online. All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21s 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic, while investing in our strategy as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic, so we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22.\nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning. Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leaving fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet and we -- than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made, throughout the year we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans. Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rates had a $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. In our domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, we had broad based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theatre. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined to 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain costs, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales, and a lower sales mix from the higher margin services category. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year, and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments which also included support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying tasks in our stores, and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our healthcare offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more headcount in-house versus using contract workers. Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several or key categories. During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21. As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first three weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact of customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions, and the risk of continued higher unemployment. With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year, and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year if needed, and there's more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our x in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year. From an SG&A standpoint, we are expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation -- in depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21 even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the CARES Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next. But the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives, as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21. Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and move to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1. We expect SG&A dollar -- dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation, as we suspended all expense during Q1 last year for corporate and field employees, as well as the gratitude and vaccination related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items combined are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health, as well as higher variable expenses associated with expected growth. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We can now take our first question from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Chukumba: Good morning, and congratulations on a strong finish to a -- to an incredible year, particularly given the COVID-19 dystopia that we're all living through. So my question was on the competitive landscape. I mean, it sounds like or I would guess that you're expecting things to be more competitive in 2021, as you said, as the world sort of returns to normal compared to maybe what you saw in 2020. But just would love to have your perspectives on that. That's my one question. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Yes, I'll start and Matt can add color. I think we would expect that we actually set it as Matt provided the outlook there to be a higher level of promotionality as we start to lap some of the strengths, obviously, from last year and we start to get into more normalized inventory positions throughout the year. And so part of the color I think that Matt provided for next year would imply that. We likely are going to have to invest a bit more to remain price competitive, which of course, since the beginning has been our priority. So, Anthony, I think your intuition is right there that we would expect things to normalize a bit in terms of promotionality.\nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. Keep up the good work.\nCorie Barry: Thanks so much, Anthony.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Horvers: Thank you. Starting with a longer term question and then have a follow-up on something more near-term. As you think about migrating to the new model, obviously, in the consumer electronics, business warranties and accessory attachment are really important. So can you talk about the -- how you see those attachment rates, in-store versus a BOPUS and versus online. Are you building an expectation that you can improve that attachment rate as the consumer becomes more digital?\nCorie Barry: So I'm going to take a little bit of a step back here in that. I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channels -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee, or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that. We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break, fix support, although that's still important and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about is my printer staying on my network? Or is my content streaming the way that I want it to? And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like Total Tech Support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them. And so it's not just about now from -- for your question, specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience, it's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working and we are continuing to work and if you think about the investments that Matt mentioned, in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app, this is still all empowered by our amazing Blue Shirts [ph] who are actually creating these experiences, we're just creating them digitally. And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact Total Tech Support or digital consultations, we're seeing more in-home advisor leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that expertise and support you get by visiting our stores. But we are seeing customers get more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly what channels have happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you. We are constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make the buying decisions in a digital environment.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. And then, on the first quarter gross margin and inventory and promotional environment, I guess, you have a very strong comp guide in the first quarter. And it doesn't sound like you're fully in stock on items. So why would you expect a more promotional environment in the first quarter? I would -- is that something you're seeing already and sort of early? I would certainly expect that to be the case as you progress through the year, but it would seem like all the pieces put together, it wouldn't seem like the promotional environment would really change year-over-year?\nMatthew Bilunas: Yes, I will start and Mike or Corie can add. Yes, I think, despite the fact that we do expect some elevated sales in Q1, as we start to enter in especially the latter part of Q1, we're going to be seeing a competitive environment where a lot of our competitors are comping some big numbers of themselves. And so we're just aware of where that might take technology and how we need to stay competitive in that environment. So you're right. There's the tale of Q1 is going to be leading up to the time we close our stores. And then we close our stores for a bit of time, the last other week. So there's a lot of different areas within Q1 and we do think towards the tail end of it, we'll start to see a bit more promotions and competitiveness as we start to see competitors react to their own situations.\nChristopher Horvers: Understood. Thanks for all the great information.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. When you laid out your comp guidance for the year, how did you factor in the potential for demand being pulled forward, not just the tougher compares you're going to face in the back half? And do you think the potential for demand being pulled forward exists for a multiyear period or is that unfold because of this wallet to shift back to leisure categories it'll happen pretty quickly and be sustained just for a short period of time? And then I\u2019ve one follow-up on your longer term guidance.\nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning. This is Matt. I'll take that and Corie or Mike can jump in. I think, fundamentally if we step all the way back, we believe the role of technology in people's lives is only intensified as a result of the pandemic and the proliferation of devices in people's lives will continue to support advancement as innovation continues. So that -- and the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year, when we think about it being probably a tale of two halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives. Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get to towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hits. So we wouldn't characterize the pullback, but just a changing of people deciding to use their wallet.\nCorie Barry: I think no matter what, Michael, people use of technology in their homes, in particular has changed forever. You have more proliferation and you're going to have more people upgrading more products and more people trying to make different ecosystems all try to work together in their homes, which I think regardless of the puts and takes in any one given year is a good thing strategically for us over the longer term.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. And my follow-up is on the comments around your expectation for your operating margin being above 5%, or the level that you had laid out at your analyst meeting a couple of years ago. And obviously at that time, it was impossible to predict that e-commerce penetration in your business would be as high as it is today this quickly. But presumably now that's a drag relative to what you expected for your profitability back then, is the offset or the entirety of the offset and even more, this new model where you're going to operate a little more efficiently at the store level, or is there other factors that are driving this expectation that your profitability is going to be higher than what you expected a couple of years ago. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: So I'm going to start with a bit of a strategic lens on that. And then I think Matt can chime in a little bit on the profitability of the [indiscernible] kind of question. When we set that target in 2019, the good news is our strategic hypothesis was spot on. The interesting part is we have made a massive amount of progress even faster, the customer has made a massive amount of progress. We knew digital penetration was going to grow pretty substantially. What we didn't know is that it was going to double in the span of a year. And so we need to take and we are taking the appropriate time to think about the longer term, given these seismic changes that we've seen. And there are lots of uncertainties including the fact we're still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we're testing and piloting a number of different models that are going to balance this kind of urgency for change, with the need to learn how the customer is changing their behavior. But what we can see in front of us, and then what we can see based on the plans we have in places is that we do think there is that room for operating rate expansion. And Matt will talk a little bit about what we're seeing even in the profitability of the channels.\nMatthew Bilunas: Yes. If you think about the channels, which are increasingly hard to kind of pull apart, as you see elevated levels of online sales, you see a lot more SG&A leverage because there's a lower fixed cost basis to that. And so, while the gross margins are tend to be lower because they don't -- our stores provide an expert service and support that only our people can give. We do see a SG&A cost structure that is less. And so our job is to actually how to optimize both those channels together to provide the same level of expertise and support, but also allow the support and convenience as they work together. But that fixed cost leverage that you get online is important as you start to look further in the year-end with elevated levels of online mix.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much and good luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. It's actually [indiscernible] on for Peter. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your full year gross margin guidance, expectations to be down a little bit. I was wondering can you just discuss some of the puts and takes there, strategy down a little bit out there 60 basis points of decline this year, and expectations for online next to moderate that. So just wondering any detail there. Thank you.\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. So the thing about gross profit next year, what we said was it would be slightly down. I think the biggest part of that are a belief that, like we said that there'll be a bit more promotionality and competitive environment as we start to get into the latter half of Q1 going forward. There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed, we did -- we were able to offer all of our services or installation delivery, there's a little bit of pressure there. In addition, I think, online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is that a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the [indiscernible] years. I also think within there, you've got a little bit of -- a promotional favorability was offset by a little bit of category mix changes that'll happen throughout the year. So fundamentally it's that assumption that online mix which stays pretty much the same.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Matt. Appreciate that. Maybe just separately, quickly, turning on the semiconductor charges that have been reported recently. Can you discuss how this might be impacting price availability currently, or perhaps in the coming quarters?\nMichael Mohan: Yes. Now it's Mike Mohan in here. Thanks for the question. I think it was around semiconductor availability [indiscernible] , which is clearly a lot of that in the news right now because we need semiconductors in almost everything that's being made. We feel pretty good because we have long-term plans with our vendors upstream for finished goods, whether they're coming from Asia or parts of the rest of the world. And there's sporadic shortages just based on demand peaks right now. Our online of sight to the incoming inventory feels good on where we're at. I think there will some impacts in other industries, but I wouldn't be the expert to speak about it here.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. Appreciate the color.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nJoe Feldman: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on inventory, how we should think about inventory through this year? It sounded like we're still -- you're still a little chasing in some categories, or where there's some lightness. But I was thinking, you do get back into stock and inventory was up maybe half percent or so this past quarter, which seemed like in a better position. Maybe you can just take us through the year how to think about it, like, should we end the year or come through the year up a little bit inventory, down a little bit? How do we think about it?\nMichael Mohan: Hey, Joe. It's Mike. I will start and Matt or Corie can chime in. We feel better about our inventory position now versus the last four calls we've had. So I'll start with that, because we've finally gotten back into better stock. That That said, we still have constraints in parts of our business that we don't think we will solve themselves in the first half of this year. Gaming is a good example. We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores, we anticipate to do that soon. But we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained and is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at home experiences. Other categories like printing have been constrained since the sort of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think it was some of the bigger categories around computing and home theatre, we're going through some natural time transitions. This would be our second home theatre transition as an example during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions, and then what do they use for demand generation. So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this, but we work so far upstream [ph] with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which then actually help us give us help -- give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and percent to fill and I feel really good about what I can see going forward and then the rest is based on consumer demand. And I think Matt talked about there's some things on the back half of this year that we have to plan for two different vectors on and I know our teams will be ready.\nJoe Feldman: Got it. Thanks. And then, if I could ask a follow-up on a separate topic. With regard to digital in the stores and fulfillment, like I guess, when you were talking about retraining re-skilling, is that related to having to teach the employees to do a better job of fulfilling orders and shipping and doing things beyond [technical difficulty] servicing the electronics, support when people come in? Like is it more about the digital support than the in-person support?\nCorie Barry: Thanks for the question, Joe. It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can in many cases opt into gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the four walls of the store. I might opt into garnering more skills in home theatre and computing, I might opt into garnering more skills around services, therefore I am more flexible throughout the store. In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work, fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders, or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility. And then there are some real digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt into being able to answer calls from a national call queue, while I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question by a call, or I might opt into being more of a -- an expert that's virtual, that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're rescaling. And then you can imagine on top of that, there might be flexibility to go work in a supply chain location, or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely. And so in all of those different vectors, we are actually starting to create training modules and create opportunities for our employees, not just for us to them flexibly, but for them to flexibly opt into different roles and different hours in a way that might meet their lives with a little bit more flexibility and progress their careers, frankly.\nJoe Feldman: That's helpful. It makes a lot of sense. And good luck this quarter. Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And we can now take our next question from Karen Short.\nKaren Short: [Technical difficulty] fiscal '22 in terms of operating margins with respect to that 5% target. So when I look at the ranges that you provided, I kind of back into a range of EBIT margins of 4.2% to 4.7%. And so I guess, in the context of that 5% target remaining intact, that does seem like a fairly, at least on the low end, big leap to make to get that to the 5% target. So I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit on that. And correct me if I'm wrong in terms of the math on that range? And then I had a follow-up.\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. I think for the full year, if we think about the top -- if we use the top end of the range, zero comp, we're likely -- our math would indicate a range that's a little bit higher than that, about 5%. That's assuming a 3%-ish sales, our SG&A increase and slight moderation or decline in operating or gross profit rate. So we -- the top end of the range should imply something that's a little north of five. Now certainly as you start to slip towards the bottom of that range, we'll look at decisions that we need to make to see if we -- where we want to end the year from an operating rate perspective. We do believe we're in a very strong position financially and we probably would resist making short-term decisions to overly manufacturer rate when we know we need to invest for our future so, but the top end of our guidance should imply something north of 5%.\nKaren Short: Okay. And then wondering just generally speaking, I know you gave a lot of details on the number of employees. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you think the optimal full time versus part time mix was? And as you said, obviously, you skewed or you had, I think a higher percent of full time but not by -- not that much. So wondering how you're thinking about that optimal mix with 102,000 in mind?\nCorie Barry: Yes, it's a little hard for me to say what's optimal when we're still striking the balance between learning about what we think the right operating model is for the future and where we are today. And so I don't -- I would hesitate to comment on what we think the optimal mix is. I think what's important for us right now is we are trying to build in flexibility that will allow us to meet the customer wherever they're deciding to interact with us across those channels. And we'll bring a little less about exactly what the optimal mix is and instead really trying to figure out how best can we use that and play our space across all the things that we need to do, and therefore staff appropriately against that. So I -- optimal, I don't think we know yet, given that we're still in the midst of a pandemic, we still have a lot of unknowns in front of us. But we do feel pretty strongly that we are now set up in a better position to be able to flex with the changing customer dynamic.\nKaren Short: Great. Thanks very much.\nCorie Barry: Thank you. Oh, and with that, I think that was our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you as we continue to progress against our strategies. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning. Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leaving fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet and we -- than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made, throughout the year we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans. Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rates had a $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. In our domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, we had broad based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theatre. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined to 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain costs, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales, and a lower sales mix from the higher margin services category. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year, and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were: one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments which also included support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying tasks in our stores, and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our healthcare offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more headcount in-house versus using contract workers. Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several or key categories. During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21. As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first three weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact of customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions, and the risk of continued higher unemployment. With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year, and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year if needed, and there's more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our x in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year. From an SG&A standpoint, we are expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation -- in depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21 even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the CARES Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next. But the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives, as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21. Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and move to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1. We expect SG&A dollar -- dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation, as we suspended all expense during Q1 last year for corporate and field employees, as well as the gratitude and vaccination related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items combined are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health, as well as higher variable expenses associated with expected growth. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Yes, I will start and Mike or Corie can add. Yes, I think, despite the fact that we do expect some elevated sales in Q1, as we start to enter in especially the latter part of Q1, we're going to be seeing a competitive environment where a lot of our competitors are comping some big numbers of themselves. And so we're just aware of where that might take technology and how we need to stay competitive in that environment. So you're right. There's the tale of Q1 is going to be leading up to the time we close our stores. And then we close our stores for a bit of time, the last other week. So there's a lot of different areas within Q1 and we do think towards the tail end of it, we'll start to see a bit more promotions and competitiveness as we start to see competitors react to their own situations. Good morning. This is Matt. I'll take that and Corie or Mike can jump in. I think, fundamentally if we step all the way back, we believe the role of technology in people's lives is only intensified as a result of the pandemic and the proliferation of devices in people's lives will continue to support advancement as innovation continues. So that -- and the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year, when we think about it being probably a tale of two halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives. Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get to towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hits. So we wouldn't characterize the pullback, but just a changing of people deciding to use their wallet. Yes. If you think about the channels, which are increasingly hard to kind of pull apart, as you see elevated levels of online sales, you see a lot more SG&A leverage because there's a lower fixed cost basis to that. And so, while the gross margins are tend to be lower because they don't -- our stores provide an expert service and support that only our people can give. We do see a SG&A cost structure that is less. And so our job is to actually how to optimize both those channels together to provide the same level of expertise and support, but also allow the support and convenience as they work together. But that fixed cost leverage that you get online is important as you start to look further in the year-end with elevated levels of online mix. Sure. So the thing about gross profit next year, what we said was it would be slightly down. I think the biggest part of that are a belief that, like we said that there'll be a bit more promotionality and competitive environment as we start to get into the latter half of Q1 going forward. There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed, we did -- we were able to offer all of our services or installation delivery, there's a little bit of pressure there. In addition, I think, online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is that a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the [indiscernible] years. I also think within there, you've got a little bit of -- a promotional favorability was offset by a little bit of category mix changes that'll happen throughout the year. So fundamentally it's that assumption that online mix which stays pretty much the same. Sure. I think for the full year, if we think about the top -- if we use the top end of the range, zero comp, we're likely -- our math would indicate a range that's a little bit higher than that, about 5%. That's assuming a 3%-ish sales, our SG&A increase and slight moderation or decline in operating or gross profit rate. So we -- the top end of the range should imply something that's a little north of five. Now certainly as you start to slip towards the bottom of that range, we'll look at decisions that we need to make to see if we -- where we want to end the year from an operating rate perspective. We do believe we're in a very strong position financially and we probably would resist making short-term decisions to overly manufacturer rate when we know we need to invest for our future so, but the top end of our guidance should imply something north of 5%."

            "name": "Michael Mohan",
            "content": "Yes. Now it's Mike Mohan in here. Thanks for the question. I think it was around semiconductor availability [indiscernible] , which is clearly a lot of that in the news right now because we need semiconductors in almost everything that's being made. We feel pretty good because we have long-term plans with our vendors upstream for finished goods, whether they're coming from Asia or parts of the rest of the world. And there's sporadic shortages just based on demand peaks right now. Our online of sight to the incoming inventory feels good on where we're at. I think there will some impacts in other industries, but I wouldn't be the expert to speak about it here. Hey, Joe. It's Mike. I will start and Matt or Corie can chime in. We feel better about our inventory position now versus the last four calls we've had. So I'll start with that, because we've finally gotten back into better stock. That That said, we still have constraints in parts of our business that we don't think we will solve themselves in the first half of this year. Gaming is a good example. We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores, we anticipate to do that soon. But we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained and is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at home experiences. Other categories like printing have been constrained since the sort of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think it was some of the bigger categories around computing and home theatre, we're going through some natural time transitions. This would be our second home theatre transition as an example during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions, and then what do they use for demand generation. So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this, but we work so far upstream [ph] with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which then actually help us give us help -- give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and percent to fill and I feel really good about what I can see going forward and then the rest is based on consumer demand. And I think Matt talked about there's some things on the back half of this year that we have to plan for two different vectors on and I know our teams will be ready."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experience often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today we're reporting strong Q4 financial results which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%. We continue to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales, as almost two thirds of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38% and even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376% and our employees delivered more than 1 million units. From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theatre. As you recall, this year we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts to manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and evened out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3 after reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February. As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issue the industry has been seeing all year, we continue to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstripped supply across the industry as is well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter. As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial result. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shopped with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year. To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepared to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisors and video chats with our store associates. In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping support and fulfillment. This drove not only new users of the app, but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first time launches of the app were up almost 80% and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%. During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continue to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who were working on the front lines, and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leaves, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring, reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3-year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S employees will receive $500 as full time and $200 as part time or occasional seasonal. In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that weren't there needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. In all, the COVID related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic, support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they were working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds. We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. And we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed the climate pledge committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month, when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1000 largest public companies on five key stakeholder categories, shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet.  Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, help employees experiencing hardship, and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top five and the second time we have been in the number one position. As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the things we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It's too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our domestic -- online sales worth 43% of our domestic sales in fiscal '21. And we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor model, and how we spend our investment dollars. Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve four shopping needs; inspiration, research, convenience, and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big box retailer with a strong omni-channel presence to an omni-channel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment. Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them. In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs. As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance urgency for teams with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiatives. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results consolidating volume, using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time. In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse grade packaging station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduce selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market. As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal. As we look to the near-term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs, and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years, or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large format locations each of the past 2 years, and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates, and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This too was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes. Since the pandemic began, our overall headcount has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we have brought back about two thirds of them. As we approached the fourth quarter any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who were on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%. Even though headcount across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full time and part time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full time and not enough part time employees. As part of the process, part time roles were offered to many of the displaced full time employees who were interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 employees, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change and how customers want to shop with us. It is important to add that we are intent on rescaling and retraining employees wherever possible, so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy. As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there's been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking, and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs both online and in our stores. The proliferation of health related devices has become so great. We created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work-at-home as well. There's an influx of products around all aspects, from high tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor roadmaps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working at home experience. Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone. Of course our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator and advisors are inspiring technology solutions by a customer consultations happening in homes, digitally in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisors while shopping on samsung.com. On the support side, our Total Tech Support program continues to receive very strong customer rating, and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully press pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year. I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians have been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long-term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail, and build to connecting patients and physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease for example. The second area is active ageing, which includes device based emergency response and other services for generation A, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active ageing builds on the GreatCall CST and Biosensics acquisitions. The third focus area is virtual care, and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring, and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician. Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health we mean curated monitoring devices, packaged with the consumer in mind with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician. In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active ageing business and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform and our data analytics and intelligence engines. In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million towards this goal. In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose, and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined. And I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan both strategically and financially much further than we expected. While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online. All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21s 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic, while investing in our strategy as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic, so we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22. Yes, I'll start and Matt can add color. I think we would expect that we actually set it as Matt provided the outlook there to be a higher level of promotionality as we start to lap some of the strengths, obviously, from last year and we start to get into more normalized inventory positions throughout the year. And so part of the color I think that Matt provided for next year would imply that. We likely are going to have to invest a bit more to remain price competitive, which of course, since the beginning has been our priority. So, Anthony, I think your intuition is right there that we would expect things to normalize a bit in terms of promotionality. Thanks so much, Anthony. So I'm going to take a little bit of a step back here in that. I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channels -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee, or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that. We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break, fix support, although that's still important and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about is my printer staying on my network? Or is my content streaming the way that I want it to? And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like Total Tech Support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them. And so it's not just about now from -- for your question, specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience, it's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working and we are continuing to work and if you think about the investments that Matt mentioned, in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app, this is still all empowered by our amazing Blue Shirts [ph] who are actually creating these experiences, we're just creating them digitally. And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact Total Tech Support or digital consultations, we're seeing more in-home advisor leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that expertise and support you get by visiting our stores. But we are seeing customers get more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly what channels have happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you. We are constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make the buying decisions in a digital environment. I think no matter what, Michael, people use of technology in their homes, in particular has changed forever. You have more proliferation and you're going to have more people upgrading more products and more people trying to make different ecosystems all try to work together in their homes, which I think regardless of the puts and takes in any one given year is a good thing strategically for us over the longer term. So I'm going to start with a bit of a strategic lens on that. And then I think Matt can chime in a little bit on the profitability of the [indiscernible] kind of question. When we set that target in 2019, the good news is our strategic hypothesis was spot on. The interesting part is we have made a massive amount of progress even faster, the customer has made a massive amount of progress. We knew digital penetration was going to grow pretty substantially. What we didn't know is that it was going to double in the span of a year. And so we need to take and we are taking the appropriate time to think about the longer term, given these seismic changes that we've seen. And there are lots of uncertainties including the fact we're still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we're testing and piloting a number of different models that are going to balance this kind of urgency for change, with the need to learn how the customer is changing their behavior. But what we can see in front of us, and then what we can see based on the plans we have in places is that we do think there is that room for operating rate expansion. And Matt will talk a little bit about what we're seeing even in the profitability of the channels. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Joe. It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can in many cases opt into gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the four walls of the store. I might opt into garnering more skills in home theatre and computing, I might opt into garnering more skills around services, therefore I am more flexible throughout the store. In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work, fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders, or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility. And then there are some real digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt into being able to answer calls from a national call queue, while I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question by a call, or I might opt into being more of a -- an expert that's virtual, that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're rescaling. And then you can imagine on top of that, there might be flexibility to go work in a supply chain location, or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely. And so in all of those different vectors, we are actually starting to create training modules and create opportunities for our employees, not just for us to them flexibly, but for them to flexibly opt into different roles and different hours in a way that might meet their lives with a little bit more flexibility and progress their careers, frankly. Thanks, Joe. Yes, it's a little hard for me to say what's optimal when we're still striking the balance between learning about what we think the right operating model is for the future and where we are today. And so I don't -- I would hesitate to comment on what we think the optimal mix is. I think what's important for us right now is we are trying to build in flexibility that will allow us to meet the customer wherever they're deciding to interact with us across those channels. And we'll bring a little less about exactly what the optimal mix is and instead really trying to figure out how best can we use that and play our space across all the things that we need to do, and therefore staff appropriately against that. So I -- optimal, I don't think we know yet, given that we're still in the midst of a pandemic, we still have a lot of unknowns in front of us. But we do feel pretty strongly that we are now set up in a better position to be able to flex with the changing customer dynamic. Thank you. Oh, and with that, I think that was our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you as we continue to progress against our strategies. Have a great day."

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong Q3 results. Our comparable sales grew a remarkable 23% as we leveraged our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model, and ability to shift quickly to digital, to meet what is clearly elevated demand for products that help customers work, learn, cook, entertain, and connect in their homes. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when, and where they shop with us to ensure it met their definition of safe retailing. The current environment has underscored our purpose to enrich lives through technology, and the capabilities we are flexing and strengthening now will benefit us going forward as we execute our strategy. Our teams showed empathy, ingenuity, and extraordinary execution throughout the quarter. Best Buy has always had a very strong culture. Over the past several years, we have been pairing that strong culture with a purpose-driven approach, and that is showing up in the way we are responding to the current environment. This pandemic as well as the natural disasters and civil unrest of the past several months has been difficult for so many people, physically, financially, and emotionally. I am incredibly proud of the way our teammates are helping not only our customers, but each other and their communities. Customers continue to shop and interact with us differently than pre-pandemic. Online sales increased 174% and comprised 35% of our total domestic sales, which we view as a testament to our strength as a multi-channel retailer. Our interactions with customers via phone and chat were significantly higher than last year, and we continue to evolve our consultation program as our advisors conducted a much higher mix of customer consultations digitally and in stores than last year when consultations were predominantly in customers\u2019 homes. We have seen elevated growth in new customers since the beginning of the pandemic. In Q3, we also saw strong growth in customers we haven\u2019t seen in a while, who have re-engaged with us as well as sales growth from our current engaged customers. As we shared on our last call, sales were up 20% for the first three weeks of the third quarter. Ultimately, as you can see in our results today, our sales growth remained elevated throughout the quarter as we continued to benefit from stay-at-home and the shift in consumer spending away from areas like travel and dining out. In addition, October included the benefit of our Prime Day-related sales, which shifted out of July this year and an earlier start to holiday promotions. From a product category perspective, consistent with last quarter, we saw strong growth across most categories, especially computing and appliances, both large and small. In addition, our home theater category returned to growth and was a significant contributor to our comparable sales increase. We were experiencing supply constraints as we entered the third quarter, and our teams worked closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. While we did see our inventory positions improve through the quarter, we experienced continued inventory constraints in a number of categories which moderated our sales growth. The high level of global demand simply continued to outstrip supply in a number of categories, particularly large appliances and computing. Our supply chain team was amazing in moving the sheer volume of product into and across the country. In addition, our speed and quality of product delivery in customer homes improved throughout the quarter with October showing our fastest ship-to-home stats since the beginning of the pandemic, despite more than 200% growth in online revenue. From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and non-GAAP EPS growth of 80% over the same period last year. This strong financial performance is allowing us to share our success with the community, our shareholders, and importantly our employees. In the quarter, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. And today, we announced we are resuming our share repurchase program. For our employees, during the quarter, we structurally raised our starting wage to $15 per hour, paid discretionary recognition bonuses to field employees, and reinstated our short-term incentive compensation. In addition, in recent weeks, we have resumed our 401(k) employer match and invested significantly in our employee well-being strategy. Some examples include expanding our Caregiver Pay program, so it can now be used to care for in-laws, siblings, and grandchildren, expanding our backup childcare benefit so employees can now use the services of someone they already know and trust and providing tutoring reimbursement for employees\u2019 children. In the early days of the pandemic, we established an employee hardship fund that continues to provide emergency funds to our employees who are sick, have loved ones who are sick, or experiencing financial hardship. As we managed through the pandemic, nothing remains more important to us than the safety of our customers and employees. As you would expect, we follow a variety of safety procedures, including requiring customers and employees to wear face coverings, requiring employees to complete daily wellness checks, frequent cleaning protocols, and more. As has been the case throughout the entire pandemic, we are also limiting the number of customers inside our stores to allow for CDC recommended social distancing. During the third quarter, customers continued to give us high marks for safe interactions as 97% of those surveyed said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes. We are constantly adjusting our operations and piloting experiences to emphasize safety and build on our ability to flexibly respond as the course of the virus changes. For example, we recently extended curbside hours to allow customers to pickup their curbside order prior to store open hours or after store close hours. Additionally, in almost all stores, while customers are still welcomed to come in and shop freely, we have transitioned all store pickup orders to curbside pickup orders. This will help reduce the people in our stores who simply need to pickup their order and will allow more customers inside who want to shop or talk to an expert. And for the much anticipated gaming console launch earlier this month, we provided our pre-order customers who had chosen the store pickup option, the ability to schedule a specific time to pickup their product. This resulted in fewer crowds and lines and was hugely successful. Both customers and employees loved it. Despite the disruption and uncertainty related to the pandemic and our current environment, we remain focused on executing Our Building the New Blue strategy. Our current way of life in our homes, reliance on technology has only reinforced our belief in our strategic direction and purpose. Many of the strategic themes we discussed at our investor update last September have come to life in a very accelerated way over the last year. These can be summed up in the following three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as a result of the pandemic, we expect it will be higher than it has been historically. Two, our work force will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers, while providing more flexible opportunities for our people. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people\u2019s lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in bringing text to life for both customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are as quickly as possible both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our business. As you will see, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the very best path forward. In line with our other strategic priorities, we continue to see opportunity for efficiencies, which will allow us to reinvest in the business and build on our experiential differentiation in the future. Now I would like to share some examples of the work we are doing as it relates to our stores and labor model. Starting with stores. Our stores provide customers the opportunity to see and touch product, ask questions, get advice and receive support. As we have discussed many times, they also serve an important role in the fulfillment of online sales. We have created what we believe to be an industry-leading store pickup experience that our customers value and now expect from us. So our stores will look different over time in terms of function, size and possibly even quantity, but they remain incredibly valuable at a cornerstone of our strategy. As we mentioned last quarter, we have started to evolve the way we use our stores for fulfillment. We are pleased with the progress of our 250 ship-from-store hub locations that we first piloted in September. In fact, we are adding about 90 locations for the holiday period. All our stores will continue to ship online orders, but these locations are positioned to ship out significantly more volume and utilize dedicated labor aimed at fulfilling orders originating online. These locations required minimal capital investment as we had the technology in place and were chosen due to their available warehouse space and proximity to carrier partners. Our expectation is that these 340 locations will ship more than 70% of our ship-from-store units during Q4. A significant benefit of our hub model is that it allows us to extend the online order cut-off to 8 p.m. for next day delivery, enabling more speed to customers. We are also testing new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs. In four Minneapolis locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to approximately 15,000 square feet from an average of 27,000. The product assortment on the sales floor will still include the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandised SKU count will be reduced, focusing on the most popular items. The remodels will result in incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship-from-store transactions as well as provide the ability to stage inventory for items that may not be on the sales floor. In one of the four locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Normally, we would not remodel any stores this close to the holiday season, but we feel it\u2019s imperative to move quickly to gain the learnings about how the store format may complement our omni-channel strategy within a particular market. In another store pilot, we are testing the financial return of reorienting the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. From a labor operating model, we are working to provide our employees opportunities to learn new skills and have more flexibility in their jobs. During the quarter, we continued to advance our flexible workforce initiative, which allow store employees to become certified to perform tasks outside their primary job function. This initiative helps employees develop their careers by giving them an opportunity to learn new skills to broaden their experience. It also gives team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the tasks performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. This in turn reduces turnover and improve satisfaction. At the start of November, over half of our associates were eligible to flex into different work zones and almost 20% of associates were scheduled in more than one department. For example, an associate who is historically a computing specialist could take a shift in the mobile department either because he or she wanted the change of pace or perhaps we needed extra labor in the department to support a launch or an associate who want additional hours can grab an extra shift making deliveries to customers\u2019 homes. In the near future, employees will also be able to easily take shifts in different store locations. Over time, we believe in place will continue to gain additional skill sets and be able to fulfill multiple roles, which will lead to additional scheduling, eligibility and flexibility for them and also drive efficiencies in labor planning and cost. This initiative works in concert with our focus on evolving the way we position employees to serve customers based on needs irrespective of channel. An example of this is the way we are supporting our customers who want to interact with us by a phone or online chat instead of coming into a store. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen demand for phone and chat interactions skyrocket during the pandemic. We have moved quickly to get about 450 dedicated store associates cross-trained to help customers via phone and chat and are skill setting another 5,000 people to flex into digital sales, if needed based on demand. These 5,000 people could hop online at the stores slow or be utilized in high volume periods during the holiday. We are looking to utilize this staff during Thanksgiving as our stores will be closed this year. In addition to phone and online chat, we have just added the ability for customers to launch a live video chat with one of these store sales associates from the comfort and safety of their own home. As it relates to our customer consultation program, our advisors continue to leverage their flexibility and skill set in meeting customer demand whether that is digitally in our stores or in homes. While the majority of consultations are still in customers\u2019 homes, the number of digital consultations is becoming a meaningful percentage of the mix. As we improve the technology and experience for digital interactions, it opens up the opportunity for our advisors to reach even more customers. Fundamentally, our strategy and competitive advantage depends heavily on our people and a differentiated service we provide our customers. It is true that due to rapidly evolving operating models and escalating demand in the first half of the year, we saw a considerable leverage on lower labor costs. We learned a lot, some which will inform ongoing leverage and efficiencies. We also learned what may not be sustainable for our strategy and the experience we want to provide our customers. We are both implementing change and piloting tests that will define our long-term working model, balancing our customer experience expectations and efficiencies. As you can see, we have been examining our business model from top to bottom to determine where we maybe able to accelerate our strategic efforts. We have also reviewed areas where we might scale back. Importantly, we viewed it as critical that the outcome of this analysis would ensure our focus and resources are closely aligned with the opportunities we see in front of us. As a result, during the quarter, we made the difficult decision to exit our operations in Mexico. I want to thank the teams in Mexico for their tremendous work over the past several years. They should all be incredibly proud of their accomplishments. Now let\u2019s talk about holiday. 2020 has truly been a year unlike any other, and that\u2019s certainly true for this year\u2019s holiday shopping season. First, we launched our Black Friday deals earlier than ever in mid-October and have had several other sales events since that time. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. We also decided to close our stores on Thanksgiving Day. In addition to our existing in-store safety measures, we have added a digital queue for customers who are waiting for assistance from an employee so they can socially distance outside in their cars or within the store while they wait. And we now have a dedicated customer experience host at every store to help guide shoppers, answer questions and manage any lines. We have also extended our store hours to close at 8:00 p.m. from 6:00 p.m. And similar to prior years, we\u2019ll add additional hours as we move through the holiday season. Meanwhile, customers who shop online now have more choices for how to get their order. Contactless curbside pickup is available at all of our stores. Online customers using our app to pickup their orders can plan their trip by viewing high and low traffic times. With first time launches of our app up 40% in Q3 compared to last year, customers are using the app more than ever and it is increasingly becoming a great self-help tool in addition to a compelling shopping experience. Of course, our online customers can also choose next day or same-day delivery. In addition to our diverse network of third party partners, we expect to have about 450 stores set-up with dedicated labor and vehicles so that our own Best Buy employees can make deliveries to our customers. Almost all Best Buy stores now offer same-day delivery on thousands of products. If the customer places an order by 1:00 p.m. local time, they\u2019ll get it by 9:00 p.m. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to update you on our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity in our community. As we have discussed before, we are committed to doing all that we can to further economic and social justice in our communities. This effort takes form in several ways, including our signature Teen Tech Centers. Currently, we have more than 30 of these locations, each of which typically operates year round in service of hundreds of teens helping them learn the technology skills necessary to be successful in the modern economy. The data on this effort is clear. We are making a measurable difference in the lives of teens who might not otherwise have this chance. By the end of 2025, we will have more than 100 of these Teen Tech Centers, serving more than 30,000 teens a year. In a related effort, we are also dedicating sizable resources to scholarships with historically black colleges and universities around the country that will of course be available to our Teen Tech Center graduates. At the same time, we are looking to do more closer to home, and are proud to announce that going forward, we plan to have one out of three non-hourly open corporate positions filled by someone who is black, indigenous or a person of color. In the field, we also plan to have one out of three non-hourly open roles filled by women. At the same time, our intention is to create over the next few years\u2019 parity and retention rates among all of these groups. In support of these initiatives, we have transferred $40 million in Q3 to the Best Buy Foundation. The senior leadership team and I are proud of the work our company has done on these initiatives, and are pleased we could increase funding on this one-time basis in support of our efforts. Earlier this month, we helped empower our employees to vote by opening our stores at noon local time on election day to ensure our store employees had the time they needed to cast a ballot in person if they chose to do so. We also gave paid time off to employees who volunteered to work at the polls on election day. We also remain committed to our broader environmental, social and corporate governance efforts, including those related to sustainability. To that end, we recently signed the Climate Pledge, a commitment to be carbon-neutral across our business by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050. This commitment is supported by the recent completion of our second solar field investment. In conclusion, we delivered very strong Q3 financial results. We are executing well and clearly benefiting from the need for people to connect, work, learn, cook and entertain at home. Throughout the pandemic, we have been confident that we will emerge an even stronger company than we were before. In the near-term, of course, much uncertainty still remains around the depth and duration of the pandemic as well as economic impacts of sustained high unemployment rates. We continue to be encouraged by our clarity of purpose and our momentum, which has guided and will continue to guide our operating model changes and investments. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant than it has ever been. And we are confident regarding our execution, adaptability and the opportunities ahead.  In many ways, our response to the impacts of the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate our strategy. And there remain many aspects of the strategy that require investment to remain relevant with customers in this very competitive omni-channel environment, such as our digital experience, supply chain, and critically important in-store and in-home associates. In fact, having the foresight to invest in these omni-channel experiences for the past several years was essential in delivering our results during this pandemic. We will continue to invest in those capabilities that focus on the customer experience over the long-term and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q3 financial results.\nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning. The demand for our products and services has remained incredibly strong for the past several months, and our Q3 sales were better than our expectations. As Corie highlighted, technology has taken on an increased importance in all of our lives. And while we are clearly seeing sales growth from consumers looking for ways to navigate through the pandemic, the fundamental reliance on technology has also grown and strengthened our purpose. On enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.06 or an increase of 82% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.1% increased 190 basis points as we saw leverage from the higher sales volume on our fixed expenses. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter increased 21% to $10.9 billion. The increase was driven by comparable sales growth of 23%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. As Corie mentioned, October included the benefit of our Prime Day-related sales, which shifted out of July this year and an earlier start to holiday promotions. This helped push October comp sales up to 33%, our highest monthly comparable sales growth of the quarter. From a merchandising perspective, we saw broad-based strength across most of our categories with the largest comparable growth coming from computing, home theater and appliances. This growth was partially offset by decline in the mobile phone category. In addition, comparable sales in our services category grew 13% during the third quarter. Similar to the broad-based strength in our product categories, our services category had positive revenue growth from both Total Tech Support and our Warranty business. In our International segment, revenue increased 25% to $1 billion. The increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 27%, which was partially offset by 140 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The growth was primarily driven by Canada where we experienced similar trends as our Domestic segment from a consumer demand standpoint. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate declined 30 basis points to 24%. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with higher mix of online revenue. As Corie noted, our online sales were 35% of our overall domestic sales in the quarter, which compared to 16% last year. We also saw lower profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. These pressures were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to both last year and our expectations going into the quarter. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 22.6%, primarily due to a less promotional environment, partially offset by increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $146 million compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased 210 basis points. On our last call, we shared our expectation that SG&A dollars in Q3 would be similar to the prior year. The largest drivers of expense increase versus last year were also the areas that were higher than our expectations at the start of the quarter. These were; one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $75 million; two, increased variable cost associated with the higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. Let me share a little additional color on the lower store payroll expense, which was driven by a fewer labor hours for our associates. This was primarily due to lower store revenue, our reduced store operating hours and efficiencies in our labor model, which were partially offset by additional hours needed to support the fulfillment of online orders. This decline in labor hours was partially offset by higher hourly wage rates as the increase in our starting wage to $15 an hour went into effect at the start of Q3. I would point out that although our Q3 store channel revenue was down approximately 8% to last year, when including the online revenue for store and curbside pickup and ship-from-store, the revenue supported by our stores labor actually increased on a year-over-year basis. On our last earnings call, we shared that about two-thirds of our original 51,000 furloughed employees had returned to work. Any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. Let me next provide more context on the restructuring charges from this quarter. As Corie mentioned, we made the decision during the quarter to close down operations in Mexico. In our Domestic segment, we also took actions to more broadly align our corporate organizational structure in support of our strategy. As a result of these decisions, we incurred approximately $111 million in restructuring charges and an additional $36 million of inventory markdowns in Mexico that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. For context on our Mexico business, its fiscal 2020 annual revenue was approximately $400 million with slightly negative operating income. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the third quarter, we completed a public bond offering for $650 million in 1.95% notes due in October 2030. The net proceeds from the sales will be used to replace the $650 million in 5.5% notes that mature in March 2021, which we expect to retire during Q4 by exercising to park off. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was approximately 1.5% lower than last year\u2019s comparable period, whereas our accounts payable balance increased 26%. We ended the quarter with inventory down 21% to last year. And although trends progressively improved throughout the quarter, as Corie stated, we still experienced constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will first reinvest in the business to drive growth and remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. We will then look to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During the third quarter, we paid $142 million in dividends. We suspended share repurchases last March in order to conserve liquidity in light of the COVID-related uncertainties, but we now plan to resume share repurchase this month. We anticipate the level of share repurchases in Q4 to be similar to last year\u2019s comparable quarter. As we look to next year, assuming business trends remained favorable, we would expect to spend a higher amount on share repurchases than we have in more recent fiscal years. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we now expect to spend approximately $725 million during fiscal 2021. Lastly, let me finish by sharing a few comments about the fourth quarter. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty, we are not providing financial guidance today. However, I would like to provide some insight into how we are thinking about Q4. As we start the fourth quarter, the demand for the products and services we sell remains at elevated levels. But similar to last quarter, it continues to be difficult for us to predict how sustainable these trends will be. In fact, we are seeing COVID cases surge throughout the U.S. and Canada at the time of significant holiday volume through our stores, online and supply chain. There continue to be other factors to consider, such as potential future government stimulus actions, the current shift in personal consumption expenditures from areas like travel and dining out, the risk of continued higher unemployment and the availability of inventory to match customer demand. From a revenue standpoint, we believe our Q4 sales growth will be positive, but we don\u2019t expect sales trends to remain at the levels we experienced during Q3. While our sales in the first few weeks of November have remained strong, they include the launch of the new gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft, and also likely a pull forward of sales from later in the holiday season. In addition, inventory constraints are expected to continue in certain key categories. We anticipate that our Q4 gross profit rate will continue to be pressured, and we expect the year-over-year rate decline in Q4 to be higher than it was in Q3. This is due to an expectation that a higher mix of online sales will continue to drive higher supply chain costs, including the increased parcel surcharges from our carrier partners. In addition, we anticipate a higher sales mix from lower margin gaming consoles to negatively impact our rate. As it relates to the promotional environment, while we expect to see continued favorability on a year-over-year basis, we expect it to be less of a tailwind than it has been in the first three quarters of this year. We expect our Q4 SG&A dollars versus the prior year to increase as a percentage in the mid to high single-digit range. The increase in SG&A is expected to be driven by incentive compensation, increased variable costs from the higher expected sales and investments in both our health business and in technology. We expect these increases to be partially offset by slightly lower store payroll expense. I will now turn the call over to operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karen Short of Barclays.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just follow-up on your last comments there. I think in 2Q, you had commented that the second half would potentially benefit from a lower or less promotional environment on the gross margin front. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about that as you look to 4Q given the comments you just made on the gross margin. And then also, wondering if you could just give very high-level puts and takes as we look to 2021, because obviously there\u2019s so many moving parts on both the gross margin and the SG&A side. So if you could just give high-level comments on how we should think about both of those into 2021 that would be helpful?\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. So for promotions, Q3 was definitely less promotional than last year, but a little bit more than we saw earlier in the year due in part to the early start to the holiday, which occurred in October. Due to the continued demand for products and industry-wide inventory strains, we're still seeing promotionality be less on a year-over-year basis. Our assumption would be that in Q4 promotionality increases a bit relative to Q3, but considering the elevated level of demand and continued constraints in some areas of inventory, we don't expect it to be a year-over-year pressure. So looking into next year from a cost perspective, from a margin and SG&A, I think it's a bit early to know exactly how that manifests next year. We're clearly going to be looking at next year quarter-by-quarter, every quarter this year was a bit different than the others. And so as we enter next year, it's likely that the trends that we're seeing continue on from a demand perspective, at least on the start. And so, we'll look at the early part of the year a little differently probably than the rest. And we'll obviously remain competitive from a pricing perspective throughout the year, but we'll also look to leverage the efficiencies and the learnings we've made this year in terms of the SG&A structure.\nKaren Short: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question, I'll make it in two parts. Maybe first for Corie, thinking about the margin structure of the business over the medium-term. I think you outlined all of those steps you're taking and the experimentation with the stores and the different labor models. I'm wondering you're doing that because you think the margin of the business could end up north of that non-GAAP goal of 5% or are these changes in order to uphold it? And then just the second question is, I think Matt mentioned, look, we still expect comp store sales to be positive for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of us expect that. But given some of the pull forward that you're seeing today, is there any reason we should see a sharp slowdown and do you have a sense of how much that pull forward is affecting the business given how early some of the Black Friday sales have started? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, Simeon. As we go back to the update that we provided last year, you could hear it in the remarks, we feel like the strategy is spot-on, and in fact more relevant than ever. And obviously, the proliferation of consumer electronics is as high as it's ever been. People are just getting more comfortable using connected devices and living a connected life, frankly, across their home. Obviously, you can appreciate we're not going to update the financial targets. I think what we would say is, in the many ways we're ahead of where we thought we would be at this time, we\u2019ve accelerated a massive amount of learnings and investments. And I think you'd also argue many retailers are ahead of where they thought they'd be at this time. I think right now we believe that's all the more reason we need to double down on what makes us unique. Therefore, we're testing, we're learning, and then probably have some suite of investing to do once we understand better the results of those tests and those hypotheses. What's most important, what remains most important is building those fundamentally sound relationships with our customers that keeps us relevant in their consideration set over time. And so, we will continue to make investments around technology, stores, membership. Could we see an EBIT rate higher than the 5% we laid out? Maybe, but that's not the goal. The goal right now is to figure out how customers are shopping differently; and therefore, the role we need to play to build those foundationally sound relationships over time.\nMatthew Bilunas: And maybe from Q3, a pull forward question that you had, I think, clearly, we outlined October sales benefited from earlier start to the holiday season. It also benefited from a shift of Prime Day from July into October. It's really difficult to predict exactly how much was pulled into Q3 from Q4, but there are a few considerations, and we talked about October being 33% growth in the month. We also talked about the start of the quarter was about 20% growth in the first few weeks. So, clearly with the elevated level of demand in October, it clearly points to a period in between those two that is around 20% or slightly lower, so that's why when we look at Q4, we don't necessarily expect the trend of Q4 to continue on at that Q3 pace. Although, we wouldn't necessarily say we're signaling sharp declines, we're just very thoughtful about the rest of the quarter coming and that we're pulling sales further into October and in November, and we have some pretty significant days ahead in terms of Thanksgiving Day being closed, but also Cyber week and the week before Christmas. So, just a lot of factors still there to think through.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thank you both.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nBradley Thomas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Great results. Question on inventory. Could you just talk a little bit more about where you're seeing shortages? Maybe how much do you think that hurt you in 3Q and how much it might hurt you in 4Q? And when do you think the supply chain may start to catch up with the strong demand? Thank you.\nMatthew Bilunas: Hey Brad. Thanks for the question. As we announced in our prepared remarks, we started the quarter with the inventory down pretty significantly versus prior year a least matched against our sales trends. And the team and I just need to call it out, did remarkable work. We see more merchandise in our fiscal third quarter I think in the history of Best Buy, which is a feat in itself. The pressures are still in the long lead time categories. Domestically, major appliances saw impacts both on inconsistent demand and then factories shutting down for COVID-related issues. And clearly, there's consumer demand with the housing market that we see as a long tail play. We're excited about being back into the inventory position we need, but we think it's going to remain constrained probably into early next year. The demand in computing has been sustained right since the start of the COVID crisis. And right in the middle of the crisis, we had a back-to-school event. Normally you guys would be asking questions about our back-to-school season. It's been back-to-school or back to work-at-home or back to educating-at-home since March. We're really happy with the supply chain model there. We have great relationships with all of the world's top OEMs and we work with them literally everyday to fulfill the needs, but I think we're going to be \u2013 we'll be tighter there than we would appreciate, but it will be enough inventory to support our sales. As we transitioned into next year, I don't see any long tail things. There's some real constraints, obviously, part of this what I was saying on the new gaming consoles, and that will probably be sustained through the holiday season. But there are long product cycle, and I see us getting in a good position fairly quickly after the holiday. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks. My question was about the one area that was down in the quarter, mobile phones. Just curious if that is simply a function of the delay of the iPhone versus a year-ago or is there something else there in terms of replacement cycles that you're seeing in consumer demand?\nMatthew Bilunas: Hey Greg. Thanks for that question. I think you kind of hit it on the head. There has been a year-over-year change on when new products were launched versus when they were in 2019. That's probably the biggest transition that you have to think about. What we're excited about is on the new devices, the demand for the higher capacity, larger screen and the phones that are purely ready to be 5G enabled are quite good. And the vast majority of the products we are selling are actually 5G enabled. So we like the demand signals going into what the new devices will look like. I think the replacement cycle on phones has been forever changed. And so the role we will play will continually help customers who are seeking out the newest technology to get the best out of their experience. And that's what we're excited about going forward.\nGreg Melich: And then a follow-up to the same question is on services. How many new customers did you get in Total Tech Services and Home Advisor? You mentioned you had more. So if you could give us a number, that would be great.\nCorie Barry: Yes. For Total Tech Support, we did grow the member count after holding pretty steady in the first half of the year. We haven't been updating that number quarterly and we're not going to now. But for reference, the last we shared was about 2.3 million members at the end of fiscal 2020. We definitely saw usage of the remote support offering continue to increase during the pandemic. And we also saw improved trends compared to earlier in the year as it relates to things like installation and repair. And we expect that usage to continue to ramp up as the stores are fully open and we're back in homes providing the more fulsome suite of services. To underscore what Mike said, I'd like to give our teams a ton of credit for the work that they have done to creatively find ways to help our customers, who in some cases are pretty desperate to make sure their devices are working together.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Great job, and have a happy Thanksgiving holidays everyone.\nMatthew Bilunas: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask about kind of the changes to the operating model, just in terms of shrinking your physical space and some of the shifts you've made to the labor model. And I guess what I'm wondering is, has the shift resulted in lower sales so lower market share, but higher returns and profitability? Is that a win or is that go-forward strategy or do you have to win on both of those fronts? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yes. Thanks for the question, Scot. The point of \u2013 so there is kind of two different subjects here. One is a very small test that we're doing right now, four stores are on square footage. And it's more about stores as a real fulfillment hub that can act as a convenient and easy place for our customers to come and get what they want, and both a more limited SKU assortment that is merchandised, but frankly a wide assortment that's available for pickup in the store as well as some services. That's really early, it's small and we're learning. On what we're trying to achieve with our operating model changes, it's interesting. What we're actually trying to achieve is a better customer experience at the end of the day that is enabled through a more flexible and more educated workforce. And the idea in that \u2013 the win is actually that we can provide more flexible expertise across the store that you might have one teammate who can work with you across the entire store that we developed the best-in-class curbside and in-store pickup capabilities. But the concept is not about pull out as much cost as possible. The concept is about creating a workforce that is more flexible and can be used across departments and frankly across customer needs. So it's not quite funky moving around in the store. Success then is actually you have a more fulsome in-store experience and your associates have the ability to garner more skills to opt into more flexible schedules and to be able to potentially at some point even move new between stores depending on their availability.\nScot Ciccarelli: So we would characterize it as more qualitative rather than quantitative in terms of the scorecard?\nCorie Barry: I think it's both, honestly, Scot. So I mean, Matt hit on in his prepared remarks, there are some efficiencies that you're able to build in, in terms of hours, but again, that's not the goal in and of itself. The goal is to provide more seamless customer experiences, better employee experiences that actually then continue to create that relationship over time, which also is a quantitative measure. It's just that it's more of a quantitative measure over time.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thanks. Have a great holiday.\nCorie Barry: Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson.\nMichael Baker: Hi. Thanks. So a product related question, but two parts, if I could. First, an update on your healthcare initiative, which really hasn't come up too much in this call. Can you talk about products in the GreatCall business, then also, where you are on the commercial side of that as the pandemic slow down discussions with insurance companies? And then the second product question is on gaming. So you said consoles, there is some concerns that that was strong in October and will that continue \u2013 excuse the dog in the background. My question is will that continue into the fourth quarter as well? Another question gaming consoles also be very strong in the fourth quarter. And so why would that slow down? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Absolutely. I'll start with some color around the health business. I think it's obvious, but it bears repeating what we're living through right now with the pandemic completely underscores our strategy and what we're trying to do, and that is to help seniors live more independently with the help of technology. I think we do that through this unique combination of technology and touch and our ability to both have the right products, to your point, but also have the services wrapper cycle around it. The consumer business was impacted earlier in the pandemic with the closure of the stores. Obviously, we sell a lot of those devices through the stores where you have a chance to really interact with the customer and explain the unique capabilities of those products. Obviously, as we've opened the stores more broadly, those trends have improved materially and we're definitely seeing that kind of GreatCall consumer side of the business ramp up. There is also just a question of broader health and fitness kind of writ large. And again, you probably know it from your own life, there are more people using technology devices whether it's at home fitness, whether it's monitoring and tracking your own fitness, there are more people using those devices. So we continue to like our positioning in the kind of broader health and fitness arena beyond just the kind of aging side of things. And then obviously, we continue to work on our relationships on the commercial side of the business where we work directly with the payers and providers. There continues to be significant interest. But you can imagine, there's a lot going on that side of the business just given the pandemic that we're working through, but the adoption of things like telehealth, the ability and frankly pull from consumers to use more tools like that only underscores the potential in that market we believe from here. Mike, maybe you want to comment on gaming?\nMichael Mohan: Yes, certainly. Mike, good question on gaming. I think maybe just some clarification. In Q3, we didn't call it out specifically that the gaming category high growth was driven from legacy devices, primarily products from Nintendo, peripherals and accessories. As we moved into Q4, the two new console launches from Microsoft and Sony are off to a great start and they reflected in the comments that Matt had at the start of the quarter. I think the only thing I'm giving perspective on is, there are going to be constrained through the quarter. And there will be more demand than there will be devices, which has been sort of a reoccurring occurrence every six or seven years. This year it's more heightened because more people I think than ever need something to do with their families at home. What we're excited about is the customer experience, steps we took to create the best experience on something constrained. These are two world-class partners, but bless their hearts, they didn't do us any favors the way they launched products. And so when we had pre-order demand, we set up everything from how you queue for it, how you booked an appointment so you wouldn't wait in line when you got your products. And as we get additional inventory during the holiday season, we were at least seeking of the way that you can find it on bestbuy.com and our digital channels and you can actually get it as a customer. We're trying to protect the experience so people who are trying to buy it and resell it or bought, I can't get through our site as easily as perhaps other places. It's a lot of work our technology and customer experience and operations teams are doing, but our goal is to get as many of these products into consumers' hands to delight them. What we can't tell you is how many we'll sell, because I actually don't know how many we're going to get, and that's probably indicative of everybody else you guys cover. I think the long-tail on this is going be pretty strong given the fact people want these devices at home and the early signs on people who are buying from Best Buy are new customers to us, slightly younger and we're excited about their ability to come back and visit us for peripherals and accessories. Hope that helps, Mike?\nMichael Baker: That does. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around the store model test that you're doing first in Minneapolis and then secondly with piloted the warehouse adjacent or the drive-up. Can you give us some color as to the timing associated with measuring the ROI on that and the potential for rolling that out in 2021 to a broader group of stores?\nCorie Barry: I think we're going to need to give this one a little bit of time, obviously. And we said in the remarks, this is about a market working together to serve customers in the most effective way possible. And so this is the very first foray into fulfillment stores like this. And my guess \u2013 not my guess, I know. We will continue to try additional formats and additional ways that we will approach the market as we head into next year. And so we'll keep you apprised as we learn more, but we definitely want to give this one enough time, especially in a pandemic world where operations are different than what steady state might look like over time. So we are urgent with it, but at the same time, we want to make sure we give it enough time so that we capture as many learnings as possible in this real market-tailored approach.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Just to clarify, enough time, is that a six or 12-month type timeframe that you're measuring or even longer?\nCorie Barry: I don't see it being something that looks like three years, certainly. And I think a little bit of this depends on how the business normalizes back through the pandemic, through some of the economic implications. So it's not just about the timeline we set, it's also about making sure that we feel like we're getting accurate and real results for where the business is going to go from here.\nSeth Basham: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.\nCurtis Nagle: Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe just following up on Mike's question on gaming and just kind of how to think about what that business looks like for the rest of the quarter. Clearly, demand for these new consoles is out to control, good, although I think basically sold out at this point. So I guess with those consoles at least in kind of very limited stocks, do you think that suppresses demand or do you think that just booked as a category that people are obviously living into now and will remain maybe a hot gifting category and things remain good. How do you think about that going through the rest of 4Q?\nMichael Mohan: Hey, Curt. I'll start. I think it's a good question and it's not an easy one to give you an answer on other than the category itself and the desire for people to entertain their families and themselves with gaming type solutions is extremely strong, and that's applicable to things that are constrained like the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But we're still seeing incredibly strong demand for all the legacy products that you could argue have been in the market for a year and a half to two years. And what I think you're going to see is, as allocations continue to improve, we've always focused on the customer experience and execution of making sure those who need these devices get them as fast as possible that you could turns into the ability for us to get more products sooner, but this is one of those items that are hard to predict. I don't think you're going to see this pull any drag on demand. I think it will be the highest demand item for this holiday and we're going to work our best to get our unfair share of allocation to take care of as many customers as possible. Corie, would you add anything else to this?\nCorie Barry: No, that was perfect.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay. And then maybe just one other quick one. One other quick category question. Just thinking about health and exercise equipment, it's something I think you guys have focused on a little bit more this year for obvious reasons. How they're performing? How do you think that category looks through the holiday and next year? Is that an area of I guess continued expansion?\nMichael Mohan: That is another great question. We're excited about the category. We talked about it a couple of quarters ago, rolling out some products to our stores as the pandemic had started. As we think about the ability to communicate to consumers in this digital first world, we're more excited right now about expanding the assortment and working on logistics of getting some of these bigger products into people's homes, helping them get set up, in some cases getting stuff out of their homes. That's one of the big paying points people are seeing. I think we've got some excitement in this space, not just for this quarter, but as it moves forward into next year. And I think it's applicable to all these other kind of consumer connected health products that we might think of them as simply as a watch or the Fitbit that you're wearing today. But as you start to put them in concert with other devices that help you live a healthier lifestyle, we're working really hard to help show customers the various options and solutions you can get with a complete suite of things to help with your fitness and wellness needs. So we're very excited about the category.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay. Thanks, and good luck for the holiday.\nMichael Mohan: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. So I was just wondering if you could talk about how you guys are thinking about next year as you're trying to comp this comp? What you can do to make it easier to go over?\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. I'll start and Corie or Mike can jump in. I think overarching Corie kind of said this a little earlier, I think it's far too early for us to really comment on sales next year. Right now we're very, very focused on helping our customers meet their demand right now with the premium on safety for both them and our employees. So that's our first objective right now. I think there's still going to be a lot of factors for us to weigh as we move into the beginning of next year. Certainly, there is a continuation of elevated demand for things to work and learn and cook and entertain for home. And it's likely that some of that continues on as we go into the beginning of next year, but may start to subside a bit. There is still a heightened level of unemployment right now and likely to continue into next year as well. And clearly, we're not totally sure on how the vaccine starts to get distributed out to everyone. So there's a lot of factors that we're continuing to weigh in, which is primarily to \u2013 as well we have a whole holiday quarter ahead of us. And so we've got to see how that shakes out in addition to that. So I think what we can see, like I said earlier, is I think these elevated trends will likely continue a bit as we go into next year, but we'll likely have to take each quarter individually and look at the demand trends that we saw this year and try to understand what they look like next year. I think fundamentally, we are seeing that role of technology only intensifying people's lives, we've said this before. I think it's really proliferated \u2013 we've proliferated devices in people's homes and those devices need to continue to be supported. Those devices needed additional advancement and innovation as we go forward. And so we see a lot of opportunities ahead of us. Each quarter will present its own unique challenges and we'll work through that and we'll give more update on next year as we get towards the end of the year.\nScott Mushkin: And kind of along that lines, how are you thinking about the inflation, both from a product perspective, but also from a wage perspective? And I'll yield. Thank you.\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. Maybe starting with the wage perspective, this year, we clearly went to move to $15 an hour with our sales within our stores. And so we'll continue to approach increases based on our processes as we go forward. So we've taken a fairly large step forward this year in terms of setting our minimum wage to $15 an hour. So from a wage perspective, we feel like we're very competitive with the wage and all the other benefits that we offer our associates. From a macro perspective, a little early to know exactly how inflation takes hold next year. There is always some level that we're factoring in, but overarchingly, it's not something that we are too worried about at this point.\nCorie Barry: I think structurally what the team has done an excellent job with is investing in our employees and then finding ways for us to meet the customer needs in the most flexible way possible. I think about this kind of like as efficiencies that are in service of the customer. So whatever the inflation kind of environment looks like, what we're focused on is making sure we find the balance between what we need to do for our people and how we can best operate the business.\nCorie Barry: And so with that, I'm going to end where we started. I want to thank all of our customers, our employees for the amazing work that they've been doing and the effort that they put forth through really incredibly different and challenging times. And thank you to all of you for joining us today. We hope you have a safe and happy holiday.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning. The demand for our products and services has remained incredibly strong for the past several months, and our Q3 sales were better than our expectations. As Corie highlighted, technology has taken on an increased importance in all of our lives. And while we are clearly seeing sales growth from consumers looking for ways to navigate through the pandemic, the fundamental reliance on technology has also grown and strengthened our purpose. On enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.06 or an increase of 82% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.1% increased 190 basis points as we saw leverage from the higher sales volume on our fixed expenses. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter increased 21% to $10.9 billion. The increase was driven by comparable sales growth of 23%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. As Corie mentioned, October included the benefit of our Prime Day-related sales, which shifted out of July this year and an earlier start to holiday promotions. This helped push October comp sales up to 33%, our highest monthly comparable sales growth of the quarter. From a merchandising perspective, we saw broad-based strength across most of our categories with the largest comparable growth coming from computing, home theater and appliances. This growth was partially offset by decline in the mobile phone category. In addition, comparable sales in our services category grew 13% during the third quarter. Similar to the broad-based strength in our product categories, our services category had positive revenue growth from both Total Tech Support and our Warranty business. In our International segment, revenue increased 25% to $1 billion. The increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 27%, which was partially offset by 140 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The growth was primarily driven by Canada where we experienced similar trends as our Domestic segment from a consumer demand standpoint. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate declined 30 basis points to 24%. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with higher mix of online revenue. As Corie noted, our online sales were 35% of our overall domestic sales in the quarter, which compared to 16% last year. We also saw lower profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. These pressures were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to both last year and our expectations going into the quarter. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 22.6%, primarily due to a less promotional environment, partially offset by increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $146 million compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased 210 basis points. On our last call, we shared our expectation that SG&A dollars in Q3 would be similar to the prior year. The largest drivers of expense increase versus last year were also the areas that were higher than our expectations at the start of the quarter. These were; one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $75 million; two, increased variable cost associated with the higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. Let me share a little additional color on the lower store payroll expense, which was driven by a fewer labor hours for our associates. This was primarily due to lower store revenue, our reduced store operating hours and efficiencies in our labor model, which were partially offset by additional hours needed to support the fulfillment of online orders. This decline in labor hours was partially offset by higher hourly wage rates as the increase in our starting wage to $15 an hour went into effect at the start of Q3. I would point out that although our Q3 store channel revenue was down approximately 8% to last year, when including the online revenue for store and curbside pickup and ship-from-store, the revenue supported by our stores labor actually increased on a year-over-year basis. On our last earnings call, we shared that about two-thirds of our original 51,000 furloughed employees had returned to work. Any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. Let me next provide more context on the restructuring charges from this quarter. As Corie mentioned, we made the decision during the quarter to close down operations in Mexico. In our Domestic segment, we also took actions to more broadly align our corporate organizational structure in support of our strategy. As a result of these decisions, we incurred approximately $111 million in restructuring charges and an additional $36 million of inventory markdowns in Mexico that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. For context on our Mexico business, its fiscal 2020 annual revenue was approximately $400 million with slightly negative operating income. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the third quarter, we completed a public bond offering for $650 million in 1.95% notes due in October 2030. The net proceeds from the sales will be used to replace the $650 million in 5.5% notes that mature in March 2021, which we expect to retire during Q4 by exercising to park off. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was approximately 1.5% lower than last year's comparable period, whereas our accounts payable balance increased 26%. We ended the quarter with inventory down 21% to last year. And although trends progressively improved throughout the quarter, as Corie stated, we still experienced constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will first reinvest in the business to drive growth and remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. We will then look to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During the third quarter, we paid $142 million in dividends. We suspended share repurchases last March in order to conserve liquidity in light of the COVID-related uncertainties, but we now plan to resume share repurchase this month. We anticipate the level of share repurchases in Q4 to be similar to last year's comparable quarter. As we look to next year, assuming business trends remained favorable, we would expect to spend a higher amount on share repurchases than we have in more recent fiscal years. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we now expect to spend approximately $725 million during fiscal 2021. Lastly, let me finish by sharing a few comments about the fourth quarter. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty, we are not providing financial guidance today. However, I would like to provide some insight into how we are thinking about Q4. As we start the fourth quarter, the demand for the products and services we sell remains at elevated levels. But similar to last quarter, it continues to be difficult for us to predict how sustainable these trends will be. In fact, we are seeing COVID cases surge throughout the U.S. and Canada at the time of significant holiday volume through our stores, online and supply chain. There continue to be other factors to consider, such as potential future government stimulus actions, the current shift in personal consumption expenditures from areas like travel and dining out, the risk of continued higher unemployment and the availability of inventory to match customer demand. From a revenue standpoint, we believe our Q4 sales growth will be positive, but we don't expect sales trends to remain at the levels we experienced during Q3. While our sales in the first few weeks of November have remained strong, they include the launch of the new gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft, and also likely a pull forward of sales from later in the holiday season. In addition, inventory constraints are expected to continue in certain key categories. We anticipate that our Q4 gross profit rate will continue to be pressured, and we expect the year-over-year rate decline in Q4 to be higher than it was in Q3. This is due to an expectation that a higher mix of online sales will continue to drive higher supply chain costs, including the increased parcel surcharges from our carrier partners. In addition, we anticipate a higher sales mix from lower margin gaming consoles to negatively impact our rate. As it relates to the promotional environment, while we expect to see continued favorability on a year-over-year basis, we expect it to be less of a tailwind than it has been in the first three quarters of this year. We expect our Q4 SG&A dollars versus the prior year to increase as a percentage in the mid to high single-digit range. The increase in SG&A is expected to be driven by incentive compensation, increased variable costs from the higher expected sales and investments in both our health business and in technology. We expect these increases to be partially offset by slightly lower store payroll expense. I will now turn the call over to operator for questions. Sure. So for promotions, Q3 was definitely less promotional than last year, but a little bit more than we saw earlier in the year due in part to the early start to the holiday, which occurred in October. Due to the continued demand for products and industry-wide inventory strains, we're still seeing promotionality be less on a year-over-year basis. Our assumption would be that in Q4 promotionality increases a bit relative to Q3, but considering the elevated level of demand and continued constraints in some areas of inventory, we don't expect it to be a year-over-year pressure. So looking into next year from a cost perspective, from a margin and SG&A, I think it's a bit early to know exactly how that manifests next year. We're clearly going to be looking at next year quarter-by-quarter, every quarter this year was a bit different than the others. And so as we enter next year, it's likely that the trends that we're seeing continue on from a demand perspective, at least on the start. And so, we'll look at the early part of the year a little differently probably than the rest. And we'll obviously remain competitive from a pricing perspective throughout the year, but we'll also look to leverage the efficiencies and the learnings we've made this year in terms of the SG&A structure. And maybe from Q3, a pull forward question that you had, I think, clearly, we outlined October sales benefited from earlier start to the holiday season. It also benefited from a shift of Prime Day from July into October. It's really difficult to predict exactly how much was pulled into Q3 from Q4, but there are a few considerations, and we talked about October being 33% growth in the month. We also talked about the start of the quarter was about 20% growth in the first few weeks. So, clearly with the elevated level of demand in October, it clearly points to a period in between those two that is around 20% or slightly lower, so that's why when we look at Q4, we don't necessarily expect the trend of Q4 to continue on at that Q3 pace. Although, we wouldn't necessarily say we're signaling sharp declines, we're just very thoughtful about the rest of the quarter coming and that we're pulling sales further into October and in November, and we have some pretty significant days ahead in terms of Thanksgiving Day being closed, but also Cyber week and the week before Christmas. So, just a lot of factors still there to think through. Hey Brad. Thanks for the question. As we announced in our prepared remarks, we started the quarter with the inventory down pretty significantly versus prior year a least matched against our sales trends. And the team and I just need to call it out, did remarkable work. We see more merchandise in our fiscal third quarter I think in the history of Best Buy, which is a feat in itself. The pressures are still in the long lead time categories. Domestically, major appliances saw impacts both on inconsistent demand and then factories shutting down for COVID-related issues. And clearly, there's consumer demand with the housing market that we see as a long tail play. We're excited about being back into the inventory position we need, but we think it's going to remain constrained probably into early next year. The demand in computing has been sustained right since the start of the COVID crisis. And right in the middle of the crisis, we had a back-to-school event. Normally you guys would be asking questions about our back-to-school season. It's been back-to-school or back to work-at-home or back to educating-at-home since March. We're really happy with the supply chain model there. We have great relationships with all of the world's top OEMs and we work with them literally everyday to fulfill the needs, but I think we're going to be \u2013 we'll be tighter there than we would appreciate, but it will be enough inventory to support our sales. As we transitioned into next year, I don't see any long tail things. There's some real constraints, obviously, part of this what I was saying on the new gaming consoles, and that will probably be sustained through the holiday season. But there are long product cycle, and I see us getting in a good position fairly quickly after the holiday. Thanks for the question. Hey Greg. Thanks for that question. I think you kind of hit it on the head. There has been a year-over-year change on when new products were launched versus when they were in 2019. That's probably the biggest transition that you have to think about. What we're excited about is on the new devices, the demand for the higher capacity, larger screen and the phones that are purely ready to be 5G enabled are quite good. And the vast majority of the products we are selling are actually 5G enabled. So we like the demand signals going into what the new devices will look like. I think the replacement cycle on phones has been forever changed. And so the role we will play will continually help customers who are seeking out the newest technology to get the best out of their experience. And that's what we're excited about going forward. Thank you. Sure. I'll start and Corie or Mike can jump in. I think overarching Corie kind of said this a little earlier, I think it's far too early for us to really comment on sales next year. Right now we're very, very focused on helping our customers meet their demand right now with the premium on safety for both them and our employees. So that's our first objective right now. I think there's still going to be a lot of factors for us to weigh as we move into the beginning of next year. Certainly, there is a continuation of elevated demand for things to work and learn and cook and entertain for home. And it's likely that some of that continues on as we go into the beginning of next year, but may start to subside a bit. There is still a heightened level of unemployment right now and likely to continue into next year as well. And clearly, we're not totally sure on how the vaccine starts to get distributed out to everyone. So there's a lot of factors that we're continuing to weigh in, which is primarily to \u2013 as well we have a whole holiday quarter ahead of us. And so we've got to see how that shakes out in addition to that. So I think what we can see, like I said earlier, is I think these elevated trends will likely continue a bit as we go into next year, but we'll likely have to take each quarter individually and look at the demand trends that we saw this year and try to understand what they look like next year. I think fundamentally, we are seeing that role of technology only intensifying people's lives, we've said this before. I think it's really proliferated \u2013 we've proliferated devices in people's homes and those devices need to continue to be supported. Those devices needed additional advancement and innovation as we go forward. And so we see a lot of opportunities ahead of us. Each quarter will present its own unique challenges and we'll work through that and we'll give more update on next year as we get towards the end of the year. Sure. Maybe starting with the wage perspective, this year, we clearly went to move to $15 an hour with our sales within our stores. And so we'll continue to approach increases based on our processes as we go forward. So we've taken a fairly large step forward this year in terms of setting our minimum wage to $15 an hour. So from a wage perspective, we feel like we're very competitive with the wage and all the other benefits that we offer our associates. From a macro perspective, a little early to know exactly how inflation takes hold next year. There is always some level that we're factoring in, but overarchingly, it's not something that we are too worried about at this point."

            "name": "Michael Mohan",
            "content": "Yes, certainly. Mike, good question on gaming. I think maybe just some clarification. In Q3, we didn't call it out specifically that the gaming category high growth was driven from legacy devices, primarily products from Nintendo, peripherals and accessories. As we moved into Q4, the two new console launches from Microsoft and Sony are off to a great start and they reflected in the comments that Matt had at the start of the quarter. I think the only thing I'm giving perspective on is, there are going to be constrained through the quarter. And there will be more demand than there will be devices, which has been sort of a reoccurring occurrence every six or seven years. This year it's more heightened because more people I think than ever need something to do with their families at home. What we're excited about is the customer experience, steps we took to create the best experience on something constrained. These are two world-class partners, but bless their hearts, they didn't do us any favors the way they launched products. And so when we had pre-order demand, we set up everything from how you queue for it, how you booked an appointment so you wouldn't wait in line when you got your products. And as we get additional inventory during the holiday season, we were at least seeking of the way that you can find it on bestbuy.com and our digital channels and you can actually get it as a customer. We're trying to protect the experience so people who are trying to buy it and resell it or bought, I can't get through our site as easily as perhaps other places. It's a lot of work our technology and customer experience and operations teams are doing, but our goal is to get as many of these products into consumers' hands to delight them. What we can't tell you is how many we'll sell, because I actually don't know how many we're going to get, and that's probably indicative of everybody else you guys cover. I think the long-tail on this is going be pretty strong given the fact people want these devices at home and the early signs on people who are buying from Best Buy are new customers to us, slightly younger and we're excited about their ability to come back and visit us for peripherals and accessories. Hope that helps, Mike? Hey, Curt. I'll start. I think it's a good question and it's not an easy one to give you an answer on other than the category itself and the desire for people to entertain their families and themselves with gaming type solutions is extremely strong, and that's applicable to things that are constrained like the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But we're still seeing incredibly strong demand for all the legacy products that you could argue have been in the market for a year and a half to two years. And what I think you're going to see is, as allocations continue to improve, we've always focused on the customer experience and execution of making sure those who need these devices get them as fast as possible that you could turns into the ability for us to get more products sooner, but this is one of those items that are hard to predict. I don't think you're going to see this pull any drag on demand. I think it will be the highest demand item for this holiday and we're going to work our best to get our unfair share of allocation to take care of as many customers as possible. Corie, would you add anything else to this? That is another great question. We're excited about the category. We talked about it a couple of quarters ago, rolling out some products to our stores as the pandemic had started. As we think about the ability to communicate to consumers in this digital first world, we're more excited right now about expanding the assortment and working on logistics of getting some of these bigger products into people's homes, helping them get set up, in some cases getting stuff out of their homes. That's one of the big paying points people are seeing. I think we've got some excitement in this space, not just for this quarter, but as it moves forward into next year. And I think it's applicable to all these other kind of consumer connected health products that we might think of them as simply as a watch or the Fitbit that you're wearing today. But as you start to put them in concert with other devices that help you live a healthier lifestyle, we're working really hard to help show customers the various options and solutions you can get with a complete suite of things to help with your fitness and wellness needs. So we're very excited about the category. Thank you."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong Q3 results. Our comparable sales grew a remarkable 23% as we leveraged our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model, and ability to shift quickly to digital, to meet what is clearly elevated demand for products that help customers work, learn, cook, entertain, and connect in their homes. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when, and where they shop with us to ensure it met their definition of safe retailing. The current environment has underscored our purpose to enrich lives through technology, and the capabilities we are flexing and strengthening now will benefit us going forward as we execute our strategy. Our teams showed empathy, ingenuity, and extraordinary execution throughout the quarter. Best Buy has always had a very strong culture. Over the past several years, we have been pairing that strong culture with a purpose-driven approach, and that is showing up in the way we are responding to the current environment. This pandemic as well as the natural disasters and civil unrest of the past several months has been difficult for so many people, physically, financially, and emotionally. I am incredibly proud of the way our teammates are helping not only our customers, but each other and their communities. Customers continue to shop and interact with us differently than pre-pandemic. Online sales increased 174% and comprised 35% of our total domestic sales, which we view as a testament to our strength as a multi-channel retailer. Our interactions with customers via phone and chat were significantly higher than last year, and we continue to evolve our consultation program as our advisors conducted a much higher mix of customer consultations digitally and in stores than last year when consultations were predominantly in customers' homes. We have seen elevated growth in new customers since the beginning of the pandemic. In Q3, we also saw strong growth in customers we haven't seen in a while, who have re-engaged with us as well as sales growth from our current engaged customers. As we shared on our last call, sales were up 20% for the first three weeks of the third quarter. Ultimately, as you can see in our results today, our sales growth remained elevated throughout the quarter as we continued to benefit from stay-at-home and the shift in consumer spending away from areas like travel and dining out. In addition, October included the benefit of our Prime Day-related sales, which shifted out of July this year and an earlier start to holiday promotions. From a product category perspective, consistent with last quarter, we saw strong growth across most categories, especially computing and appliances, both large and small. In addition, our home theater category returned to growth and was a significant contributor to our comparable sales increase. We were experiencing supply constraints as we entered the third quarter, and our teams worked closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. While we did see our inventory positions improve through the quarter, we experienced continued inventory constraints in a number of categories which moderated our sales growth. The high level of global demand simply continued to outstrip supply in a number of categories, particularly large appliances and computing. Our supply chain team was amazing in moving the sheer volume of product into and across the country. In addition, our speed and quality of product delivery in customer homes improved throughout the quarter with October showing our fastest ship-to-home stats since the beginning of the pandemic, despite more than 200% growth in online revenue. From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and non-GAAP EPS growth of 80% over the same period last year. This strong financial performance is allowing us to share our success with the community, our shareholders, and importantly our employees. In the quarter, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. And today, we announced we are resuming our share repurchase program. For our employees, during the quarter, we structurally raised our starting wage to $15 per hour, paid discretionary recognition bonuses to field employees, and reinstated our short-term incentive compensation. In addition, in recent weeks, we have resumed our 401(k) employer match and invested significantly in our employee well-being strategy. Some examples include expanding our Caregiver Pay program, so it can now be used to care for in-laws, siblings, and grandchildren, expanding our backup childcare benefit so employees can now use the services of someone they already know and trust and providing tutoring reimbursement for employees' children. In the early days of the pandemic, we established an employee hardship fund that continues to provide emergency funds to our employees who are sick, have loved ones who are sick, or experiencing financial hardship. As we managed through the pandemic, nothing remains more important to us than the safety of our customers and employees. As you would expect, we follow a variety of safety procedures, including requiring customers and employees to wear face coverings, requiring employees to complete daily wellness checks, frequent cleaning protocols, and more. As has been the case throughout the entire pandemic, we are also limiting the number of customers inside our stores to allow for CDC recommended social distancing. During the third quarter, customers continued to give us high marks for safe interactions as 97% of those surveyed said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes. We are constantly adjusting our operations and piloting experiences to emphasize safety and build on our ability to flexibly respond as the course of the virus changes. For example, we recently extended curbside hours to allow customers to pickup their curbside order prior to store open hours or after store close hours. Additionally, in almost all stores, while customers are still welcomed to come in and shop freely, we have transitioned all store pickup orders to curbside pickup orders. This will help reduce the people in our stores who simply need to pickup their order and will allow more customers inside who want to shop or talk to an expert. And for the much anticipated gaming console launch earlier this month, we provided our pre-order customers who had chosen the store pickup option, the ability to schedule a specific time to pickup their product. This resulted in fewer crowds and lines and was hugely successful. Both customers and employees loved it. Despite the disruption and uncertainty related to the pandemic and our current environment, we remain focused on executing Our Building the New Blue strategy. Our current way of life in our homes, reliance on technology has only reinforced our belief in our strategic direction and purpose. Many of the strategic themes we discussed at our investor update last September have come to life in a very accelerated way over the last year. These can be summed up in the following three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as a result of the pandemic, we expect it will be higher than it has been historically. Two, our work force will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers, while providing more flexible opportunities for our people. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in bringing text to life for both customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are as quickly as possible both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our business. As you will see, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the very best path forward. In line with our other strategic priorities, we continue to see opportunity for efficiencies, which will allow us to reinvest in the business and build on our experiential differentiation in the future. Now I would like to share some examples of the work we are doing as it relates to our stores and labor model. Starting with stores. Our stores provide customers the opportunity to see and touch product, ask questions, get advice and receive support. As we have discussed many times, they also serve an important role in the fulfillment of online sales. We have created what we believe to be an industry-leading store pickup experience that our customers value and now expect from us. So our stores will look different over time in terms of function, size and possibly even quantity, but they remain incredibly valuable at a cornerstone of our strategy. As we mentioned last quarter, we have started to evolve the way we use our stores for fulfillment. We are pleased with the progress of our 250 ship-from-store hub locations that we first piloted in September. In fact, we are adding about 90 locations for the holiday period. All our stores will continue to ship online orders, but these locations are positioned to ship out significantly more volume and utilize dedicated labor aimed at fulfilling orders originating online. These locations required minimal capital investment as we had the technology in place and were chosen due to their available warehouse space and proximity to carrier partners. Our expectation is that these 340 locations will ship more than 70% of our ship-from-store units during Q4. A significant benefit of our hub model is that it allows us to extend the online order cut-off to 8 p.m. for next day delivery, enabling more speed to customers. We are also testing new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs. In four Minneapolis locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to approximately 15,000 square feet from an average of 27,000. The product assortment on the sales floor will still include the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandised SKU count will be reduced, focusing on the most popular items. The remodels will result in incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship-from-store transactions as well as provide the ability to stage inventory for items that may not be on the sales floor. In one of the four locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Normally, we would not remodel any stores this close to the holiday season, but we feel it's imperative to move quickly to gain the learnings about how the store format may complement our omni-channel strategy within a particular market. In another store pilot, we are testing the financial return of reorienting the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. From a labor operating model, we are working to provide our employees opportunities to learn new skills and have more flexibility in their jobs. During the quarter, we continued to advance our flexible workforce initiative, which allow store employees to become certified to perform tasks outside their primary job function. This initiative helps employees develop their careers by giving them an opportunity to learn new skills to broaden their experience. It also gives team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the tasks performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. This in turn reduces turnover and improve satisfaction. At the start of November, over half of our associates were eligible to flex into different work zones and almost 20% of associates were scheduled in more than one department. For example, an associate who is historically a computing specialist could take a shift in the mobile department either because he or she wanted the change of pace or perhaps we needed extra labor in the department to support a launch or an associate who want additional hours can grab an extra shift making deliveries to customers' homes. In the near future, employees will also be able to easily take shifts in different store locations. Over time, we believe in place will continue to gain additional skill sets and be able to fulfill multiple roles, which will lead to additional scheduling, eligibility and flexibility for them and also drive efficiencies in labor planning and cost. This initiative works in concert with our focus on evolving the way we position employees to serve customers based on needs irrespective of channel. An example of this is the way we are supporting our customers who want to interact with us by a phone or online chat instead of coming into a store. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen demand for phone and chat interactions skyrocket during the pandemic. We have moved quickly to get about 450 dedicated store associates cross-trained to help customers via phone and chat and are skill setting another 5,000 people to flex into digital sales, if needed based on demand. These 5,000 people could hop online at the stores slow or be utilized in high volume periods during the holiday. We are looking to utilize this staff during Thanksgiving as our stores will be closed this year. In addition to phone and online chat, we have just added the ability for customers to launch a live video chat with one of these store sales associates from the comfort and safety of their own home. As it relates to our customer consultation program, our advisors continue to leverage their flexibility and skill set in meeting customer demand whether that is digitally in our stores or in homes. While the majority of consultations are still in customers' homes, the number of digital consultations is becoming a meaningful percentage of the mix. As we improve the technology and experience for digital interactions, it opens up the opportunity for our advisors to reach even more customers. Fundamentally, our strategy and competitive advantage depends heavily on our people and a differentiated service we provide our customers. It is true that due to rapidly evolving operating models and escalating demand in the first half of the year, we saw a considerable leverage on lower labor costs. We learned a lot, some which will inform ongoing leverage and efficiencies. We also learned what may not be sustainable for our strategy and the experience we want to provide our customers. We are both implementing change and piloting tests that will define our long-term working model, balancing our customer experience expectations and efficiencies. As you can see, we have been examining our business model from top to bottom to determine where we maybe able to accelerate our strategic efforts. We have also reviewed areas where we might scale back. Importantly, we viewed it as critical that the outcome of this analysis would ensure our focus and resources are closely aligned with the opportunities we see in front of us. As a result, during the quarter, we made the difficult decision to exit our operations in Mexico. I want to thank the teams in Mexico for their tremendous work over the past several years. They should all be incredibly proud of their accomplishments. Now let's talk about holiday. 2020 has truly been a year unlike any other, and that's certainly true for this year's holiday shopping season. First, we launched our Black Friday deals earlier than ever in mid-October and have had several other sales events since that time. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. We also decided to close our stores on Thanksgiving Day. In addition to our existing in-store safety measures, we have added a digital queue for customers who are waiting for assistance from an employee so they can socially distance outside in their cars or within the store while they wait. And we now have a dedicated customer experience host at every store to help guide shoppers, answer questions and manage any lines. We have also extended our store hours to close at 8:00 p.m. from 6:00 p.m. And similar to prior years, we'll add additional hours as we move through the holiday season. Meanwhile, customers who shop online now have more choices for how to get their order. Contactless curbside pickup is available at all of our stores. Online customers using our app to pickup their orders can plan their trip by viewing high and low traffic times. With first time launches of our app up 40% in Q3 compared to last year, customers are using the app more than ever and it is increasingly becoming a great self-help tool in addition to a compelling shopping experience. Of course, our online customers can also choose next day or same-day delivery. In addition to our diverse network of third party partners, we expect to have about 450 stores set-up with dedicated labor and vehicles so that our own Best Buy employees can make deliveries to our customers. Almost all Best Buy stores now offer same-day delivery on thousands of products. If the customer places an order by 1:00 p.m. local time, they'll get it by 9:00 p.m. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to update you on our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity in our community. As we have discussed before, we are committed to doing all that we can to further economic and social justice in our communities. This effort takes form in several ways, including our signature Teen Tech Centers. Currently, we have more than 30 of these locations, each of which typically operates year round in service of hundreds of teens helping them learn the technology skills necessary to be successful in the modern economy. The data on this effort is clear. We are making a measurable difference in the lives of teens who might not otherwise have this chance. By the end of 2025, we will have more than 100 of these Teen Tech Centers, serving more than 30,000 teens a year. In a related effort, we are also dedicating sizable resources to scholarships with historically black colleges and universities around the country that will of course be available to our Teen Tech Center graduates. At the same time, we are looking to do more closer to home, and are proud to announce that going forward, we plan to have one out of three non-hourly open corporate positions filled by someone who is black, indigenous or a person of color. In the field, we also plan to have one out of three non-hourly open roles filled by women. At the same time, our intention is to create over the next few years' parity and retention rates among all of these groups. In support of these initiatives, we have transferred $40 million in Q3 to the Best Buy Foundation. The senior leadership team and I are proud of the work our company has done on these initiatives, and are pleased we could increase funding on this one-time basis in support of our efforts. Earlier this month, we helped empower our employees to vote by opening our stores at noon local time on election day to ensure our store employees had the time they needed to cast a ballot in person if they chose to do so. We also gave paid time off to employees who volunteered to work at the polls on election day. We also remain committed to our broader environmental, social and corporate governance efforts, including those related to sustainability. To that end, we recently signed the Climate Pledge, a commitment to be carbon-neutral across our business by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050. This commitment is supported by the recent completion of our second solar field investment. In conclusion, we delivered very strong Q3 financial results. We are executing well and clearly benefiting from the need for people to connect, work, learn, cook and entertain at home. Throughout the pandemic, we have been confident that we will emerge an even stronger company than we were before. In the near-term, of course, much uncertainty still remains around the depth and duration of the pandemic as well as economic impacts of sustained high unemployment rates. We continue to be encouraged by our clarity of purpose and our momentum, which has guided and will continue to guide our operating model changes and investments. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant than it has ever been. And we are confident regarding our execution, adaptability and the opportunities ahead.  In many ways, our response to the impacts of the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate our strategy. And there remain many aspects of the strategy that require investment to remain relevant with customers in this very competitive omni-channel environment, such as our digital experience, supply chain, and critically important in-store and in-home associates. In fact, having the foresight to invest in these omni-channel experiences for the past several years was essential in delivering our results during this pandemic. We will continue to invest in those capabilities that focus on the customer experience over the long-term and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q3 financial results. Good morning, Simeon. As we go back to the update that we provided last year, you could hear it in the remarks, we feel like the strategy is spot-on, and in fact more relevant than ever. And obviously, the proliferation of consumer electronics is as high as it's ever been. People are just getting more comfortable using connected devices and living a connected life, frankly, across their home. Obviously, you can appreciate we're not going to update the financial targets. I think what we would say is, in the many ways we're ahead of where we thought we would be at this time, we've accelerated a massive amount of learnings and investments. And I think you'd also argue many retailers are ahead of where they thought they'd be at this time. I think right now we believe that's all the more reason we need to double down on what makes us unique. Therefore, we're testing, we're learning, and then probably have some suite of investing to do once we understand better the results of those tests and those hypotheses. What's most important, what remains most important is building those fundamentally sound relationships with our customers that keeps us relevant in their consideration set over time. And so, we will continue to make investments around technology, stores, membership. Could we see an EBIT rate higher than the 5% we laid out? Maybe, but that's not the goal. The goal right now is to figure out how customers are shopping differently; and therefore, the role we need to play to build those foundationally sound relationships over time. Thank you. Yes. For Total Tech Support, we did grow the member count after holding pretty steady in the first half of the year. We haven't been updating that number quarterly and we're not going to now. But for reference, the last we shared was about 2.3 million members at the end of fiscal 2020. We definitely saw usage of the remote support offering continue to increase during the pandemic. And we also saw improved trends compared to earlier in the year as it relates to things like installation and repair. And we expect that usage to continue to ramp up as the stores are fully open and we're back in homes providing the more fulsome suite of services. To underscore what Mike said, I'd like to give our teams a ton of credit for the work that they have done to creatively find ways to help our customers, who in some cases are pretty desperate to make sure their devices are working together. Thank you. You too. Yes. Thanks for the question, Scot. The point of \u2013 so there is kind of two different subjects here. One is a very small test that we're doing right now, four stores are on square footage. And it's more about stores as a real fulfillment hub that can act as a convenient and easy place for our customers to come and get what they want, and both a more limited SKU assortment that is merchandised, but frankly a wide assortment that's available for pickup in the store as well as some services. That's really early, it's small and we're learning. On what we're trying to achieve with our operating model changes, it's interesting. What we're actually trying to achieve is a better customer experience at the end of the day that is enabled through a more flexible and more educated workforce. And the idea in that \u2013 the win is actually that we can provide more flexible expertise across the store that you might have one teammate who can work with you across the entire store that we developed the best-in-class curbside and in-store pickup capabilities. But the concept is not about pull out as much cost as possible. The concept is about creating a workforce that is more flexible and can be used across departments and frankly across customer needs. So it's not quite funky moving around in the store. Success then is actually you have a more fulsome in-store experience and your associates have the ability to garner more skills to opt into more flexible schedules and to be able to potentially at some point even move new between stores depending on their availability. I think it's both, honestly, Scot. So I mean, Matt hit on in his prepared remarks, there are some efficiencies that you're able to build in, in terms of hours, but again, that's not the goal in and of itself. The goal is to provide more seamless customer experiences, better employee experiences that actually then continue to create that relationship over time, which also is a quantitative measure. It's just that it's more of a quantitative measure over time. Thanks. You too. Absolutely. I'll start with some color around the health business. I think it's obvious, but it bears repeating what we're living through right now with the pandemic completely underscores our strategy and what we're trying to do, and that is to help seniors live more independently with the help of technology. I think we do that through this unique combination of technology and touch and our ability to both have the right products, to your point, but also have the services wrapper cycle around it. The consumer business was impacted earlier in the pandemic with the closure of the stores. Obviously, we sell a lot of those devices through the stores where you have a chance to really interact with the customer and explain the unique capabilities of those products. Obviously, as we've opened the stores more broadly, those trends have improved materially and we're definitely seeing that kind of GreatCall consumer side of the business ramp up. There is also just a question of broader health and fitness kind of writ large. And again, you probably know it from your own life, there are more people using technology devices whether it's at home fitness, whether it's monitoring and tracking your own fitness, there are more people using those devices. So we continue to like our positioning in the kind of broader health and fitness arena beyond just the kind of aging side of things. And then obviously, we continue to work on our relationships on the commercial side of the business where we work directly with the payers and providers. There continues to be significant interest. But you can imagine, there's a lot going on that side of the business just given the pandemic that we're working through, but the adoption of things like telehealth, the ability and frankly pull from consumers to use more tools like that only underscores the potential in that market we believe from here. Mike, maybe you want to comment on gaming? I think we're going to need to give this one a little bit of time, obviously. And we said in the remarks, this is about a market working together to serve customers in the most effective way possible. And so this is the very first foray into fulfillment stores like this. And my guess \u2013 not my guess, I know. We will continue to try additional formats and additional ways that we will approach the market as we head into next year. And so we'll keep you apprised as we learn more, but we definitely want to give this one enough time, especially in a pandemic world where operations are different than what steady state might look like over time. So we are urgent with it, but at the same time, we want to make sure we give it enough time so that we capture as many learnings as possible in this real market-tailored approach. I don't see it being something that looks like three years, certainly. And I think a little bit of this depends on how the business normalizes back through the pandemic, through some of the economic implications. So it's not just about the timeline we set, it's also about making sure that we feel like we're getting accurate and real results for where the business is going to go from here. No problem. No, that was perfect. Thank you. I think structurally what the team has done an excellent job with is investing in our employees and then finding ways for us to meet the customer needs in the most flexible way possible. I think about this kind of like as efficiencies that are in service of the customer. So whatever the inflation kind of environment looks like, what we're focused on is making sure we find the balance between what we need to do for our people and how we can best operate the business. And so with that, I'm going to end where we started. I want to thank all of our customers, our employees for the amazing work that they've been doing and the effort that they put forth through really incredibly different and challenging times. And thank you to all of you for joining us today. We hope you have a safe and happy holiday."

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong quarterly results and we are encouraged to see the customer demand for our products and services. I'm proud of the amazing execution of our teams to these unprecedented times. However, we have not lost sight of the fact that people continue to suffer and we extend our sympathy to all those who have lost someone to the virus, are sick with COVID-19 or are facing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. From the very start of this crisis, we've been focused on the guiding the business with two goals in mind. First, ensuring the health and safety of our customers and employees while protecting the employee experience as much as possible; and second, making certain we come out of this moment, a strong, innovative company. The results we are reporting today would not be possible without the effort and energy of our frontline employees working in our stores, supply chain facilities and customers home. I want to thank all our employees for their tremendous commitment to our customers and for living our purpose to enrich lives through technology. They are navigating not only the impacts of the pandemic, but also fires, hurricanes and civil unrest. Their willingness even enthusiasm to continually adapt as we manage through the evolving environment has been extraordinary. For our second quarter, we are reporting revenue of $9.9 billion, which is growth of approximately 4% from the second quarter of last year. Our Q2, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.71 compared to $1.08 last year. Enterprise comparable sales growth was 5.8%, despite the fact that our stores were opened by appointment-only for the first six weeks of the quarter. Products that help people work, learn, connect and cook at home, like computing, appliances and tablets were the biggest drivers of our sales growth. Trends across most categories improved materially throughout the quarter, as we opened our stores for shopping, especially categories like large appliances and home theater that benefit from more experiential shopping. We also saw very strong digital demand for some of our newer categories such as digital health and fitness, at-home fitness equipment, sustainable living, outdoor activities and camping equipment. While still relatively small categories from a revenue standpoint, they are extremely relevant in today's environment and highlight our ability to leverage our digital first mindset supported by our expertise around curation and supply chain. Throughout the quarter, we experienced inventory constraints in a number of categories, which did moderate our sales growth. While we expected product constraints as we entered the quarter, the stronger-than-anticipated demand as we open our stores for shopping resulted in more constrained product availability than we expected. Turning to profitability. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9% expanded almost 200 basis points from last year, due to materially lower SG&A expense. The lower SG&A is a direct result of balanced but prudent decisions to lower costs in response to the uncertainty of the pandemic and our evolving operating model. That level of lower SG&A, for the most part, is not sustainable as we add labor hours in our stores, reinstate short-term incentive plans and increase advertising spend. Matt will provide more detail later, but we expect Q3 SG&A expense to be more in line with last year's third quarter. I would like to take a moment to recap the evolution of our store operating model. We ended Q1 in a curbside only model with no in-store customer shopping. At the beginning of Q2, we started welcoming customers back into our stores by offering an in-store consultation service to customers by appointment only.  On June 15, we began allowing customers to shop without an appointment at more than 800 stores across the U.S. and as of June 22, almost all of our stores were open for shopping. At that time, approximately half of the 51,000 associates we had in furloughed in April returned. We also resumed our in-home sales consultations, adding to the other in-home services we provide like delivery, installation and repair, we had previously resumed back in May. As we reopened our stores, we saw considerable demand from customers to clearly value and want an in-store shopping experience. Prior to reopening, we were retaining approximately 92% of last years' revenue at the start of Q2. Then, in the last seven weeks of the quarter, total sales grew 16% compared to the same period last year. Trends have remained strong in August, with sales up approximately 20% for the first three weeks of Q3, as customers demand for product special than work, learn and cook. To meet this increased demand, we have now returned approximately two-thirds of the furloughed associates. Throughout this time period and across the ways customers can shop, we have continued to adhere to safety protocols that limit capacity, follow strict social distancing practices and use proper protective equipment, including requiring our employees and customers to wear mask. Like many retailers, we\u2019re also operating at reduced store hours, we were operating with approximately 20% fewer hours than last year to match customer demand patterns. This pandemic and the swift shift in customer buying behavior really underscore the importance of our strong multichannel capabilities. For the full quarter, our domestic online revenue grew 240% from last year. Even when stores open for customer shopping, online sales growth continued to be extremely strong, in fact, last seven weeks of the quarter, online revenue grew approximately 180% over the same period last year. Domestic online sales have continued to be very strong in Q3 and are up approximately 175% for the first three weeks of August. We believe it is essentially to provide options that let customers choose what works best for them. We are continuing to provide fulfillment options, customers have come to expect from all retailers like fast and free home delivery, and buy online and pickup in store. We will also continue to provide great experiences like curbside pickup, in-store consultations, and of course, home installation of appliances, TVs, fitness equipments and more. And our digital experiences such as chatting with an expert or leveraging a digital consultation in your home to remain popular options. During the first half of the year, and responding to the pandemic, we made decisions across all these operating models that stressed safety. Although, we temporarily gave up some share while our stores were closed to customer traffic, according to our data, our share has largely recovered since reopening. Most importantly, we made the right decisions for our employees and customers. In Q2, more than 97% of customers surveyed indicated that that we made them feel safe and we believe the credibility we garnered will over time contribute to more brand love and thus more revenue. I would add that since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen elevated growth in the number of new customers. And while it is still early, these new customers are showing a higher likelihood to return than new customers in the prior year period. As we look forward, the environment is still evolving and our operating model and supporting cost structure is evolving as well. The pandemic has accelerated the evolution of retail and compelled us to change our operating model in the best interest of our customers and employees. It has allowed us to expedite some planned strategic changes that will set us up to emerge from this time even stronger. I'd like to provide some insight into our approach, starting with three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers, while also providing more flexible opportunities for our people. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives due to the pandemic. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in bringing tech to life for both customers and our vendor partners. As you would imagine, these concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our business. These implications have been considered as we have made decisions throughout the course of the pandemic and will help our strategy for our future store design, our operating models and our digital investments. We will provide more examples as our plans evolve, but here are some initial thoughts on strategic implications over the next several quarters. From a store standpoint, we have been responding to the impacts from the pandemic in a way that has been enabled by tremendous flexibility at the local level. We are leveraging localized data and analytics that allow us to pilot various services like opening stores an hour earlier for consultations only. Using data and analytics also allows us to quickly and productively customize operations to the local situation if necessary. This is especially important for us to effectively respond should the virus flare up in certain markets. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as a result of the pandemic, we expect it will be higher than it has been historically. As a result, we are starting to evolve the way we use our stores for fulfillment. For example, next month, we will be piloting a ship from store hub model to help handle significant volume pre-holiday and year-round. All our stores will still ship out online orders, but approximately 250 locations will be positioned to ship out significantly more volume. These locations were chosen for their space, proximity to carrier partners and ability to support same and next-day delivery. Over time, this should allow us to deliver a more productive fulfillment model. We are also continuing to add additional third party physical pickup locations for online orders to provide more flexibility and convenience for customers, and now have more than 16,000, covering 85% of the population within five miles. As it relates to our people, we are investing in compensation and beginning to incorporate elements of the flexible workforce, we first introduced at our Investor Day a year ago. We took a major step earlier this month by evolving the pay structure for our store employees and raising the starting wage to $15 per hour. Since the early stages of the pandemic, all hourly retail associates and supply chain employees who were working received incremental hourly appreciation pay. The incremental hourly appreciation pay started March 22 and ended August 1. On August 2, the beginning of our third quarter, we implemented a new pace structure that reflects an ongoing evolution and is the result of clear and consistent feedback from field employees across the country. To provide more predictability and pay, a 4% increase in hourly rate replaced short-term incentive compensation for hourly store employees below the leadership level. After the 4% hourly pay increase, employees were not yet at $15 per hour, had their pay increased to the $15 per hour starting wage. For field leadership and corporate employees, we are reinstituting short-term incentive compensation programs for the back half of the year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've worked in partnership with our company founder, Dick Schulze to provide our employees with emergency financial assistance. Together, we've established two funds totaling more than $10 million, one for the benefit of any full or part-time employee meeting general financial help and a second for those who have become ill with the virus. We are also evolving the way we work to position employees to serve customers, based on need irrespective of channel. A few early examples include our consultation program and our Geek Squad agents. As most of you know, we launched our In-Home Advisor program a few years ago. At that time, the program consistent of highly trained individuals, who were strictly going into customers' homes to provide free comprehensive technology consultations. In May, we developed an in-store appointment engine, as we adapted our operating model to respond to the pandemic. As a result, our In-Home Advisor program has been worked into a consultation across all channels model. We now have a system with tiered advisors, which provides more opportunities for more employees by matching employees with the needs of the customer. And they can provide free consultation in stores, in homes and via phone or chat, depending on customer preferences. Our Geek Squad Agents are not only providing technical support to customers in stores, many of them have also been cross-trained to work in our call centers, providing crucial phone and chat support to solve a variety of customer needs. Another example of the way we are increasing the flexibility of our workforce is our store employees who are making same day deliveries to customers home from 200 of our stores. The examples I just showed have largely stemmed from our response to the pandemic. Going forward, we are on a path to develop a flexible workforce model that leverages technology and provides associates the ability to work whenever and wherever they want. Right now, we are building the foundation by leading our store employees through skills-based training for their existing rules. Overtime, there will be opportunities for employees to gain additional skill sets and be able to fulfill multiple rules which will lead to additional scheduling eligibility and flexibility. From a customer experience standpoint, our strategy is to not only keep pace with, but anticipate changes in customer expectations including safety by adopting a customer accessed approach that is primarily digital. I'll share a few examples of how this is showing up in our app, which saw the number of customer downloads double compared to last year. We are piloting more opportunities for virtual consultation, with our blue-shirts and in-home consultants including abilities to share live video. This is especially critical during the current environment, an increased need for remote consultation and assistance capabilities. We are also expanding our use of augmented reality in the shopping experience, so customers can more easily select the right products based on the space in their homes by using the camera on their own phone. For the in-store experience, we are piloting a self-service in aisle checkout for selected SKUs. This will allow a checkout process that is fast, convenient and involves minimal contact for customers. And for our curbside pickup experience, we are adding functionality that will display information about high and low traffic times and provide digital updates for customers when they are in the parking lot waiting for their curbside orders. We will continue to add features and capabilities to the app to drive frequency, retention and personalization opportunities, all of which are significantly higher in the app than other digital channels. As it relates to the third implication of the pandemic, one of the ways in which technology is playing a more crucial role in our lives is related to health. For Best Buy Health, our focus on digital health, in particular, helping seniors live more independently with our unique combination of tech and touch has become even more relevant as the world responds to the pandemic and concepts like Telehealth become more mainstream. We continue to expand our assortment of health related products and looking forward, see this as an area of technology innovation we are uniquely well suited to help customers navigate. We recently announced to our employees a new President of Best Buy Health, Deborah DiSanzo, who will start in September. Deborah has more than 30 years of experience at the intersection of health care and tech including leading the IBM Watson Health team, where she launched artificial intelligence offerings designed to help doctors, researchers, health care providers, pharmacists and insurers better serve patients around the world. She's also the former CEO of Philips Healthcare where she helped bring consumer-grade automatic defibrillators to the market. She is a recognized thought leader in artificial intelligence and big data. Has deep experience in running businesses known for their innovation in health care and has a demonstrated ability to drive growth both organically and through acquisitions. We are excited to have her lead our strategic work to bring health technology into the home to help people live better, safer and more independent lives. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to talk about our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion in our community. We are always striving to attract and invest in talent that reflects the diversity of all communities and fosters an inclusive culture across the organization. We're powered by the belief that our people matter most and diverse perspectives make us better. Our culture of inclusion values every human beings experience and supports each employee to bring their true and authentic self to work. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. Earlier this year, the human rights campaign named us a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. And Forbes Magazine named us on its list of America's Best Employers for Women. We were also recently named one of Parity.org's best companies for women to advance. In the wake of George Floyd's death and the subsequent protest, Best Buy is committed to doing better when it comes to taking action to address racial inequities and injustices. We've created a diverse task force within the company to help us define and create meaningful change and we will provide visibility to our corresponding commitments in the near future. We've also committed to creating more than 100 Teen Tech Centers to help bridge the opportunity gap and the digital divide for teens in disinvested communities across the country. And we're one of the leaders in a new public-private partnership called Connected Minnesota that will provide computers and Internet access to thousands of youth in our home state. Finally, we have signed on as a founding member of the Parity.org ParityPledge in support of people of color. This is a public commitment to interview at least one qualified person of color for every open leadership role that is at the Vice President level or higher, including the in C-suite and Board of Directors.  In conclusion, we delivered very strong Q2 financial results in an environment that continues to evolve. We are executing well and also clearly seeing benefit from the need for people to connect, work, learn, cook and entertain at home. Looking back it was only five months ago that we closed our stores to customer traffic, drew down the full amount of our revolver, made the difficult decision to furlough associates and saw total sales decline reach 30% at one point. Throughout the pandemic, we have been confident that we will emerge an even stronger company than we were before. Clearly, we are still operating in a dynamic environment, and much uncertainty remains around future outbreaks, government stimulus efforts and the economic impact of sustained high unemployment levels and ongoing shutdowns that vary by industry. We are cognizant of all these factors. At the same time, we are encouraged by our clarity of purpose and our momentum, which has guided and will continue to guide our operating model changes and investments. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant than it has ever been, and we are confident regarding our execution, adaptability and opportunities ahead. We will continue to invest in those capabilities that focus on the customer experience over the long-term and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q2 financial results.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning. As Corie highlighted, the demand for our product resources was remarkably strong during the quarter. Although, we didn\u2019t provide guidance for the quarter during our last earnings call, we shared a belief that our Q2 sales would be pressured and we would experience a decline in our operating income rate. Ultimately, as we continue to see increased demand for our products, our ability to open almost all of our stores to customer traffic much sooner than we had expected resulted in the stronger-than-anticipated results. And while we are pleased with the financial results and our teams ability to navigate the rapidly changing environment is we also know that our goals reach beyond any one quarter's results and we still face an uncertain environment. An enterprise revenue of $9.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.71, or an increase of 58% versus last year. As a percentage of sales, our non-GAAP operating income of 5.9% increased 190 basis points compared to the prior year. As Corie mentioned, the primary driver of the operating income rate expansion was lower non-GAAP SG&A expense of $290 million, which was 290 basis points of favorable to last year as a percentage of sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decline a 100 basis points compared to the last year, which partially offset the SG&A favorability. In relation to SG&A, we made several cost decisions in Q1 and as we entered Q2 to alight with the lower sales and sales trend we were seeing expecting to continue at that point. These included keep store employees on furlough to spending short-term incentives and lower advertising expenses. And as we opened our stores, we saw significantly improved sales trends that outpaced our staffing levels for the period of time. These sales on a temporarily lower cost base resulted in incremental leverage that drove a more favorable operating income rate. I would now like to provide some additional details on our Q2 results. In our domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter increased 3.5% to $9.1 billion the increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 5%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 25 stores that are permanently closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. As a reminder, our comparables sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside only operating model during the period as a result of COVID-19. Domestic online revenue of almost $5 billion, with 53% domestic revenue, which was up from 16% last year, and 42% in Q1 of this year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 242% over the second quarter of last year. Buy online and pick up in store, or curbside was 41% of online sales. I want to note that approximately $5 billion in revenue represents the most online revenue we have ever generated in a single quarter in the company's history, surpassing our previous all time high by almost 40%. From a merchandise perspective, as Corie mentioned, the largest comparable growth categories were computing, appliances and tablets. This growth was partially offset by declines in mobile phones and digital imaging. Home theater comp sales were approximately flat to last year, a material improvement from Q1\u2019s performance as trends continue to improve, as we opened our stores to customer shopping. Additionally, televisions specifically saw a year-over-year comp sales increase. Our gaming category was also approximately flat to last year. While strong demand continued across the category, sales of accessories like controllers and headsets, was offset by constrained inventory availability of gaming consoles. Comparable sales in the services category declined approximately 9% for the decline in services was primarily due to a higher mix of online sales, which has a lower attach rates than in store, within the quarter our sales growth continued to improve as our stores reopened. In our International segment, revenue increased 9.4% to $782 million. The increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 15.1% which was partially offset by 490 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The growth was primarily driven by Canada, where we experienced similar trends of our domestic segment, from a product category standpoint. And we were able to open almost all locations without appointment, approximately two weeks sooner than, we did in the U.S. Turning now to gross profit, domestic growth profit rate declined 120 basis points to 22.8%. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain cost associated with a higher mix of online revenue. We also saw lower profit share in revenue from our private label and co-branded, credit card arrangement, which impacted our gross profit rate by approximately 20 basis points. Our gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was higher than our expectations going into the quarter, driven by a more favorable promotional environment and a higher mix of sales, from the stores channel. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP decreased $195 million, compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased approximately 280 basis points. The largest drivers of the expense decline were, one, lower store payroll expense of approximately $100 million. Two, lower advertising expense of approximately $40 million -- $40 million, three, lower incentive compensation expense of approximately $30 million, related to both, field and corporate employees, and four, lower medical claims expense, of approximately $25 million. Let me share a little additional color, on the lower store payroll expense. The lower store payroll expense represents, a number of components, but the primary driver was fewer labor hours for our associates, the fewer labor hours primary due to stores being closed to non-appointment traffic for approximately half of the quarter in our reduced store operating hours. This decline in labor hours was partially offset by higher hourly wage rates, mainly incremental appreciation pay, for those who are working in our stores, throughout the quarter. Our international SG&A decreased at $24, compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased approximately 500 basis points primarily, due to lower store expense in Canada and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5.3 million in cash. During the quarter, we repaid the full amount of our $1.25 billion credit facility that we had drawn in March. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 21%, lower than last year's comparable period, whereas our accounts payable balance increased 31%. And the health of our inventory remains strong. And the lower inventory position reflects the inventory challenges as Corie referenced earlier. During the second quarter, we reached at $143 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend in the range of $650 million to $750 million, during fiscal 2021. Lastly, let me finish by sharing a few comments about the back half of the year. As a result, of the ongoing uncertainty we are not providing financial guidance today. However, I would like to provide some insights, into how we are thinking about Q3 and the rest of the year. Overall, as we plan for the back half of the year, we continue to weigh many factors, including a potential future government stimulus actions, the current shift in personal consumption expenditures from areas like travel and dining out, the possible depth and duration of the pandemic, the risk of continued higher unemployment, and the availability of inventory to match customer demand. With that said, as we enter Q3, there continues to be a heightened demand for the products and services we offer. It is difficult for us to know how sustainable these sales trends are considering the factors I just noted. We are planning for Q3 sales to be higher compared to last year, but likely will not continue at the current level of approximately 20%. We also have plans in place that will allow us to adapt quickly if we needed through the remainder of the year. We anticipate that our Q3 gross profit rate will continue to be pressured compared to last year, as we expect online sales will continue to be a higher percentage of our overall sales mix compared to the prior year. We also expect lower price sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement. As Corie mentioned, we expect our Q3 SG&A dollars to be very similar to last year\u2019s Q3. We expect the combination of our pay evolution changes and the store labor hours we have planned for our current operating model will actually result in slightly lower store expense in Q3. We expect this will be offset by higher advertising expense as we prepare for our earlier start to the holiday season as well as increased variable costs from the anticipated revenue growth. On a sequential basis, we expect the increase in SG&A dollars versus Q2 will primarily be driven by increased store labor hours, reinstatement of short-term extended plans and the increase in advertising expense. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning. May be just to start with now you finished there on expenses, as we think back to the Analyst Day last year and the $1 billion cost reduction program, I think you spoke to in the fourth quarter a $160 million of savings against that plan in the back half of last year. Can you update us on where you guys are today because the expectation for flat expenses in the third quarter seems to assume some reinvestment in understanding the variable cost pressure here, but the two-thirds of furloughed associates have returned, just trying to understand, what's driving the lack of flow-through right on the achievement against the cost reduction program?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Yes, from a cost reduction standpoint, clearly we did a number of temporary actions and decisions to navigate through Q1 and Q2. As it\u2019s been our brand for years, we will continue to look for cost efficiencies to help improve our cost basis. We're in a very unique timeframe right now to determine exactly how much is structural or permanent reductions. And so, we will update people as we go through the remainder of the year and into next year. But we do see permanent savings as we move through this time. It's really difficult to determine exactly how much -- I would say as you move from SG&A into Q3, the sequential change, as we talked about, was really looking at increasing store labor hours with the assumption that stores will be open to customer traffic for the whole quarter. And if you look at store labor hours in total, while we are increasing labor hours for them being open and also, we've also increased the hourly wage rate. So with those two included, we still have store labor hours that are slightly lower than last year. So, we do believe we're finding some leverage as we move into Q3. We did say that Q3 sales are actually going to be higher in Q3, exactly how much, we don't know. But with a similar SG&A level in Q3, with higher sales, we would expect SG&A leverage to continue in Q3, exactly how much we'll determine and by how much sales we actually have and how much gross profit rate pressure we'd be able to offset.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, maybe sticking with the margin just on gross. You talked about two pressures, right, in the third quarter, channel mix, right and profit sharing. But you didn't mention promotions or mix. As we think about entering the holiday selling season here, what is sort of the promotional calendar looking like from your perspective today?\nCorie Barry: Sure. To be clear, in Q2, the primary gross profit rate pressure we saw was coming from supply chain in the form of higher parcel expense. As a reminder, we had 53% of our business done online versus 42% in Q1. So parcel expense is the biggest gross profit rate pressure. And then in addition to that, we continue to see pressure from the lower profit sharing from the city relationship we have. Those are expected to continue into Q3. Promotionally, we actually expected it to be a little bit more promotional going into Q2. It was actually a little less than we actually expected as we work through the quarter. If you look at promotionality into Q3, we would expect that promotionality to be sequentially up from Q1 and Q2, but still not a year-over-year pressure. There are a number of changes to the events and promotions in Q3 that we're obviously working through, but we wouldn't expect to be a year-over-year pressure at this point.\nOperator: And now I'll move to our next caller. We will hear from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wondered digging on some of the category trends that you\u2019re seeing in August or July, in August whatever you think is better wins to work it through. What are you seeing and sort of what I would describe -- sort of pulls back-to-school category? Are you seeing home theater and TV up or you're seeing wireless up? What about gaming in advance of the two new platforms? And is -- and to what degree is this still all driven by or largely driven by back-to-school and work from home categories?\nCorie Barry: Hi, Chris. Thanks for the question. We're seeing favorable trends across literally all of our categories right now as we exit Q2 and start Q3 with the one exception that we noted around mobile phones. But we're seeing trends that are applicable to every part of learning, working, entertaining and cooking from home. And some of that in Corie and Matt's prepared remarks are impacted by the fact we don't have as much inventory as we would like to have right now, but the demand curves that we saw when we opened our stores have continued as we've entered into August well beyond just the traditional back-to-school categories. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color.\nChris Horvers: Can you share with us perhaps, like what you're seeing in home theater as an example on a quarter-to-date basis?\nMike Mohan: I can't give you the details of quarter-to-date, but we did talk about the improvement in our television performance. I think that's pretty reflective of the -- both the importance of the role we play in the TV or the electronics industry and the importance of stores play because we switched from a negative trajectory in Q1 to a positive trajectory. And our second quarter also includes lapping last year's Prime Day business, where we do a lot of revenue with our own exclusive models with our Amazon Fire TV. So we see the consumer demand strong. We see the demand is strong for larger products and for things that have additional features, higher resolution and clearly, bigger screens as people are spending more time at home.\nChris Horvers: Understood. And maybe can you talk about, as my follow-up question, the gross margin mix in I would have thought in the second quarter. You would have seen a pretty solid gross margin mix headwind. Was that essentially fully offset by a lower promotional posture year-over-year? Or was the net of those two things actually positive?\nMike Mohan: Yes. We're not going to give specifics. But largely, the product mix that we experienced in Q2 was fundamentally offset by the promotional -- the favorable promotional environment that we saw in Q2. And we would expect the product mix to continue similarly in Q3, assuming computing continues to be a higher mix of our business. And as we said, promotionality will likely be a little bit more in Q3. We'll see how it ends up a little bit more than Q2. And to the extent how much it is favorable. We'll determine how much it offsets the mix impact.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now move to your next question, Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPeter Keith: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Nice execution here. I wanted to look at the margin differential between the retail stores and e-comm. Historically, you've highlighted that e-comm has a lower contribution margin. But now just considering the stronger digital sales going forward, are there efforts to maybe close the gap between those two margins and perhaps bring them in line in future quarters?\nMike Mohan: Yeah. In the past, we've talked about the two channels. First, it's really hard to parse out exactly the two different P&Ls between online and store. Overall, on an annual basis, the EBIT levels of both of those channels are actually pretty similar. Now each quarter can be a little bit different. The makeup is a little different, too. Online has typically had a little less, a little lower gross profit rate, a little bit more SG&A leverage. Stores, while carries a little bit more gross profit rate. It carries a little bit more SG&A burden. So they kind of offset each other, and so similar EBIT levels -- or they're pretty similar EBIT level. And when you go through what we saw in Q1, that dramatic change of online sales -- going to online sales, you can't necessarily correct right away in those periods. So, what we've done is made some prudent and necessary steps to kind of look at our SG&A structure. And as we go forward, we'll obviously be looking at how to improve the efficiency of whichever channel we have. I'd say over the years at online, we've actually been improving our gross margin rates. And even over this period of time, we've seen better attach rates during the time. Our store will close in Q1 and Q2. So, we will continue to improve the customer experience to kind of improve the gross margin rates online and continue to look at our cost structure overall for both channels.\nPeter Keith: Okay. That sounds encouraging. And maybe on a more near-term question, with the commentary about sales growth up 20% in Q3, and you would expect that to moderate certainly, I think that's a good stance to take. Although what I'm asking is, are there identifiable aspects of the sales growth today that you think will go away, whether that's back-to-school or some other category that's abnormally strong right now?\nCorie Barry: Peter, I'm going to take that one. I think there are a few -- I would characterize them more as unknowns as we look into the back half here. And I would cite things like where we are in the government aid programs and whether or not there will be a new package going forward. Obviously, the stimulus, to some extent has helped certainly up to this point. And it's hard to say how long that kind of hangover effect of that continues. I think there's questions around overall sustained unemployment levels and also school opening and closing decisions and how long those stretch out in the period. And then, of course, we've highlighted inventory availability and what we feel strongly all of our vendor partners are doing everything they can to catch back up. You're talking about holiday levels on manufacturing and fulfillments, and that just is going to take a bit of time to catch trends this tight. And then finally, the actual duration and depths of the virus and how that proceeds through the fall. And so I think it's less about distinctly calling out categories Peter and a little bit more about just the environment that we find ourselves in.\nOperator: And now we'll take our question from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You noted that your share has largely recovered. Why wouldn't you be gaining share, especially as your stores are now open and you're growing sales 20% quarter-to-date?\nCorie Barry: So we believe we continue -- we said it in Q1, we lost some share, and we saw that trend continuing in because our stores were largely closed. And we also said, we view that as very temporal in nature. And you're right, we said in the script that we've seen the share recover. There are puts and takes week-to-week, honestly, Michael. There are some where we actually believe we\u2019re gaining. There are others where we think it's a little bit more moderate. Sometimes that can depend on the even inventory position at the time, but overarchingly, we feel pretty strongly that we are in a good share position. And I think our key is that continue to remain incredibly focused on providing the experience that we would expect seamlessly across the channels, still with an emphasis on safety. And we definitely see that in our customer responses. They're very favorably responding to the environment that we're creating. And so I think the team has done a very nice job across however the customer wants to shop meeting their needs. And I think we're very well positioned as we head into Q3 into the back half from a share perspective.\nMichael Lasser: Including my follow-up is you discussed that SG&A expenses will be similar to last year in the third quarter. You just operated with a new model that showed you can perform pretty well without having to incur as much of a operating expense burden as you had in the past. So what's prompting your view that you need to go back to a full expense rate?\nCorie Barry: Yeah, I think it's one of the reasons we did the walk of our different models in the script, was -- so everyone understood that we operated the first six weeks on an appointment-only model. And obviously, we saw demand for people wanting to come back into our stores. We opened and we said at that point we brought back about half of our furloughed associates. Honestly, the demand was so high as we opened the stores back up that we were not able to provide the level of service that we would have wanted. And you can see it in things like attach rate of services in the store. You could see it in how heavy the business was at our precincts and how many services people wanted to acquire, we literally didn't have enough people in the stores and hours in the stores to be able to handle that kind of demand. Hence the reason we said that by the end of the quarter we had two-thirds of our furloughed associates back in the hours associated with that so we can meet some of that demand. Now you're going to have a fully normalized quarter, where you're going to have both a new starting wage of $15, but also what we think is the labor commensurate to meet the demand and provides a level of service that will help highlight our ability to provide services or financial services, or lease-to-own or many of the other things that come with a full transaction for us.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. Thank you very much and good luck.\nOperator: Now we\u2019ll take a question from Matt McClintock with Raymond James.\nMatt McClintock: Hi. Yes. Good morning everyone. And congrats to the Best Buy team on good execution. I wanted to ask two questions. The first one is just on supply chain, many fulfillment hubs for the stores that you are shifting to, to this model. Can you talk a little bit about your capacity to shift volume to that method? And then how do you think about the reduction in freight cost and the benefit that you will get as you make this transition? That will be my first question. Thanks.\nMike Mohan: Hey, Matt, it's Michael. I'll start with the question. I think about it in two different ways. We were pioneer in this whole idea of buy online and pick up in store, which allowed us to be the first major retailer to figure out how do we ship from store. And based on some of our store size, as we have store that has access capacity, I think you're aware of some of our store conditions. And when we look at what we did for automation over the last three years and the thing that we need to do, it's very easy for us to receive products in our seven RDCs and then put them on a normal truck runs out to the stores that we already do. And if we need to run extra trucks out to these 250 locations, so we can actually have rapid replenishment. And we've been able to use our analytics and algorithms to understand where the density in shipping volumes will come from. It's partially designed to lower expense because you can absolutely have more customers pick up in-store, that's happening at these locations, but it's closer to our carrier delivery pads. It's also basically launching our own same delivery with our Best Buy team members, which is a lower cost than using a third-party service. So there's a mix of all of those choices that we will over time, we believe deliver a lower partial fulfillment expense. But right now, our biggest priority is making sure when you're shopping on Best Buy's digital sites, and we talked about doubling the amount of app downloads, we really want to make sure when you're looking at the item you want, that to get it by data is accurate and it's competitive, and we feel very good about that. And that's the primary thing we focused on for this holiday.\nMatt McClintock: Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up question is new leadership Best Buy Health. Any strategic changes that you're thinking about that business? Or just any new different direction that you're going to go with, given the various skills that she brings with her? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: I mean our focus and confidence in the health business remains incredibly strong, and obviously the environment that we find ourselves been only reinforces that strategy. I think Deborah brings just exceptional experience combining technology with healthcare, this idea of tech and touch that we've talked about before, her life experiences in bringing those things together. So I think we found someone who has life experience that very closely aligns with where we think the strategy needs to go. And I wouldn't see the strategic point of view change very much. I just think that we have an ability to continue to accelerate our strategy.\nMatt McClintock: Thanks for the color. Best of luck.\nOperator: And Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets will have the next question.\nAnthony Chukumba: Good morning. Congrats on another spectacular quarter. Also wanted to commend you on all your -- everything you're doing from a social justice perspective. So I have a quick question then a follow-up. You talked a lot about the shift to online. It's --different things we're doing in the store and the 200 stores are going to be hubs for the online, for online deliveries. And I know it's early, but does that make you sort of rethink, how do you think about, what's the right number of stores going forward if you think a lot of this online shift is going to be permanent?\nCorie Barry: Thank you, Anthony, for the compliments. And let me start by saying, one of the implications we laid out in the script were talking that customer shopping behavior has changed permanently. The customer is in charge. So this isn't about being seamless across channels. It's about being seamless, for the customer. And even at our Investor Day last year, we were talking about, how the customer behavior was changing and accelerating, probably even moving faster, than most retailers were. And so we've been building, with this as the assumption, honestly, we've been improving our digital experiences. We've been building a phenomenal and flexible supply chain, and have employees in stores that are moving at speed with the customers. Most of the capabilities that we've used, you hit on curbside, but also in-store consultations, the cross-training in the stores, we do ship from our stores not just the hubs, the hubs will be used to ship larger quantities. And 60% right now of what we're selling is flowing through our stores in some way, either curbside or in-store pickup or shipped from store. And so, this only underscores our belief that our stores are a unique and powerful asset for us. And I think that, what we will see is that the stores maybe used differently. It's not about left stores, but it might be about more points of presence and a different ability to meet the customer. But we do think one of the unique assets that we have, is our ability to move with speed and frankly put the customer in control, to experience us whatever the way they want.\nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just for my follow-up. So, you beat the consensus estimate by a country mile again, this quarter. You repaid your entire revolving credit facility. You're sitting on over $5 billion worth of cash, at what point and I know there is lot of uncertainty out there. we're living it every day in this post-COVID Dystopia, as I do this call from my home office. At what point do you feel like you know where we've got kind of gotten to the other side, we can start to buy back stock again?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're evaluating, when we may resume stock buybacks. Fundamentally, our allocation strategy has not changed, we first -- we're always going to reinvest at our business, to do what's right for our customers long-term. We still plan to be a premium dividend payer and at some point return all the excess cash to shareholders. I think, ultimately, you nailed that this is a kind of a very uncertain environment, for many reasons, holidays like we look very different, as like many companies where we're taking the time to really evaluate and when we might resume that. But right now, we like the position we're in, to be able to keep flexibility through the remaining part of this year, but we will certainly readdress that at some point.\nAnthony Chukumba: That\u2019s helpful. Keep up the good work.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: So, the first question I wanted to ask, I think, Corie, you discussed in your prepared comments just the degree to which, new customers come in Best Buy. I think either stores or online is helping to drive the sales recovery. Maybe discussion just a little further the makeup of these customers, where they may be coming from? How different they are done? And the customers that Best Buy catered to in the past? I mean are we seeing now that Best Buy brand is now through this quite as actually reaching a new demographic?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. Obviously, it's early. So, we're still assessing exactly who all these customers are. I think it's at least clear for us that they are customers for whom we may not have been in the consideration set prior. And like we said in the prepared remarks, clearly, it\u2019s only been five months, but some of those new customers we obtained in March, have shown a much higher propensity to repeat sales, than those new customers we obtained last year during the same period. Nicely, we have also seen our engaged customers start to rebound as we\u2019ve reopened stores. So, it's a little bit the best of both worlds, which is why we're so experientially focused on creating the right environment, both safety and choice that will make us appealing for all customers. So we'll continue to peel apart who those customers are, but honestly our bigger priority right now is not just who they are, it's how do we reengage them, how do we continue to bring them into the Best Buy ecosystem and make them a little bit stickier to the brand, which is why we talk about things like brand love, we talk about things like safety because those become the measures by which the brand is valued over time.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. It\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up, this time related to \u2013 you talked as absolute broad base sales during the quarter with the exception as you called out the mobile category. So, my question there is, is that -- you think the weakness in mobile carriers, is the mobile function of maybe a lack of product cycle or just the disruptions to the stores through most of the second quarter or is it something else?\nMatt Bilunas: Hey, Brian. Yes, I think, you've got actually both of the answers and a part of your question. It\u2019s a one category that is most dependent on our store traffic for the customer experience to make sense. It\u2019s still complicated to do that process online even some of the carrier stores aren\u2019t even open 7 days a week right now. So, we are really focused on the customer experience in advance of new handset launches this fall on 5G. We are still very excited about the category and the experience we create. We did make some enhancements so you can trade in your old connected device portfolio online because we're trying to be cognizant of what the customer is going to need. But it's one area where having our stores closed for a big part of the quarter probably played the biggest impact on the performance we just announced.\nBrian Nagel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Looks like we have time for one final question. We'll hear from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually have just two quick follow-up questions to some that have already been asked. We wanted to ask about the acceleration that you're seeing in sales in August. Just what do you think is driving that, given the fact that the stimulus has stated here a little bit. And just wanted to follow-up on the promotional commentary too, about why you don\u2019t necessarily see more pressure in Q3 year-over-year? Does it have to do with still trying to control traffic into the store or the tighter inventory level?\nCorie Barry: I'll start, Kate, and maybe Matt can follow with some of that promotional commentary. In terms of the strength, and Mike had said it, we are really seeing broad-based strength. Now clearly, there is a work-from-home, learn-from-home component to this. And especially heading into back to school, you\u2019ve got right now, estimates are two-thirds of kids doing at home learning. So that combination of learning at home and a lot of parents working from home and shared devices have to be able to have your own networks and own devices and own webcams. And I mean, there's clearly a lot there. And that will be an extended phenomenon as it's going to have kids going back and forth, probably some school to work. But we're also seeing people want to entertain. We talked a little bit about gaming and the demand there we thought that was a category that was going to be well down this year heading into new launches, and it's been performing. And it's not just about gaming consoles; it's about the computing that\u2019s used for gaming as well, which has been incredibly strong. Mike talked about televisions and entertainment, and this idea back to sports and being able to start to at least watch sports again on devices. I mean everything that people are doing right now is on the back of technology in their home. And it completely underscores our purpose and our philosophy, and that is you actually right now are enriching your life through technology. And we're seeing it across basically every aspect of what we are selling in our stores.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. And getting to the promotional question, I think what I said earlier was promotionally, we'll probably be a little higher in Q3 than it was in Q2 and Q1, but fundamentally still not a pressure on a year-over-year basis. In terms of Q3, we would still expect to see a heightened customer demand and just overall, some level of inventory constraints as we work through the quarter. Clearly, as those change it could affect promotionality. But with those two factors involved, I think we still expect to see promotionality a little, not a pressure on a year-over-year basis. Clearly, the promotional cadence and events could change in Q3 and we -- holiday that will probably start early year. But even with those, we believe the demand for the products and services we sell and just also the inventory availability will continue to lend itself to the less promotional environment.\nCorie Barry: And with that, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

And as we said, promotionality will likely be a little bit more in Q3. We'll see how it ends up a little bit more than Q2. And to the extent how much it is favorable. We'll determine how much it offsets the mix impact. Yeah. In the past, we've talked about the two channels. First, it's really hard to parse out exactly the two different P&Ls between online and store. Overall, on an annual basis, the EBIT levels of both of those channels are actually pretty similar.

            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning. As Corie highlighted, the demand for our product resources was remarkably strong during the quarter. Although, we didn't provide guidance for the quarter during our last earnings call, we shared a belief that our Q2 sales would be pressured and we would experience a decline in our operating income rate. Ultimately, as we continue to see increased demand for our products, our ability to open almost all of our stores to customer traffic much sooner than we had expected resulted in the stronger-than-anticipated results. And while we are pleased with the financial results and our teams ability to navigate the rapidly changing environment is we also know that our goals reach beyond any one quarter's results and we still face an uncertain environment. An enterprise revenue of $9.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.71, or an increase of 58% versus last year. As a percentage of sales, our non-GAAP operating income of 5.9% increased 190 basis points compared to the prior year. As Corie mentioned, the primary driver of the operating income rate expansion was lower non-GAAP SG&A expense of $290 million, which was 290 basis points of favorable to last year as a percentage of sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decline a 100 basis points compared to the last year, which partially offset the SG&A favorability. In relation to SG&A, we made several cost decisions in Q1 and as we entered Q2 to alight with the lower sales and sales trend we were seeing expecting to continue at that point. These included keep store employees on furlough to spending short-term incentives and lower advertising expenses. And as we opened our stores, we saw significantly improved sales trends that outpaced our staffing levels for the period of time. These sales on a temporarily lower cost base resulted in incremental leverage that drove a more favorable operating income rate. I would now like to provide some additional details on our Q2 results. In our domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter increased 3.5% to $9.1 billion the increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 5%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 25 stores that are permanently closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. As a reminder, our comparables sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside only operating model during the period as a result of COVID-19. Domestic online revenue of almost $5 billion, with 53% domestic revenue, which was up from 16% last year, and 42% in Q1 of this year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 242% over the second quarter of last year. Buy online and pick up in store, or curbside was 41% of online sales. I want to note that approximately $5 billion in revenue represents the most online revenue we have ever generated in a single quarter in the company's history, surpassing our previous all time high by almost 40%. From a merchandise perspective, as Corie mentioned, the largest comparable growth categories were computing, appliances and tablets. This growth was partially offset by declines in mobile phones and digital imaging. Home theater comp sales were approximately flat to last year, a material improvement from Q1's performance as trends continue to improve, as we opened our stores to customer shopping. Additionally, televisions specifically saw a year-over-year comp sales increase. Our gaming category was also approximately flat to last year. While strong demand continued across the category, sales of accessories like controllers and headsets, was offset by constrained inventory availability of gaming consoles. Comparable sales in the services category declined approximately 9% for the decline in services was primarily due to a higher mix of online sales, which has a lower attach rates than in store, within the quarter our sales growth continued to improve as our stores reopened. In our International segment, revenue increased 9.4% to $782 million. The increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 15.1% which was partially offset by 490 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The growth was primarily driven by Canada, where we experienced similar trends of our domestic segment, from a product category standpoint. And we were able to open almost all locations without appointment, approximately two weeks sooner than, we did in the U.S. Turning now to gross profit, domestic growth profit rate declined 120 basis points to 22.8%. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain cost associated with a higher mix of online revenue. We also saw lower profit share in revenue from our private label and co-branded, credit card arrangement, which impacted our gross profit rate by approximately 20 basis points. Our gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was higher than our expectations going into the quarter, driven by a more favorable promotional environment and a higher mix of sales, from the stores channel. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP decreased $195 million, compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased approximately 280 basis points. The largest drivers of the expense decline were, one, lower store payroll expense of approximately $100 million. Two, lower advertising expense of approximately $40 million -- $40 million, three, lower incentive compensation expense of approximately $30 million, related to both, field and corporate employees, and four, lower medical claims expense, of approximately $25 million. Let me share a little additional color, on the lower store payroll expense. The lower store payroll expense represents, a number of components, but the primary driver was fewer labor hours for our associates, the fewer labor hours primary due to stores being closed to non-appointment traffic for approximately half of the quarter in our reduced store operating hours. This decline in labor hours was partially offset by higher hourly wage rates, mainly incremental appreciation pay, for those who are working in our stores, throughout the quarter. Our international SG&A decreased at $24, compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased approximately 500 basis points primarily, due to lower store expense in Canada and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5.3 million in cash. During the quarter, we repaid the full amount of our $1.25 billion credit facility that we had drawn in March. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 21%, lower than last year's comparable period, whereas our accounts payable balance increased 31%. And the health of our inventory remains strong. And the lower inventory position reflects the inventory challenges as Corie referenced earlier. During the second quarter, we reached at $143 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend in the range of $650 million to $750 million, during fiscal 2021. Lastly, let me finish by sharing a few comments about the back half of the year. As a result, of the ongoing uncertainty we are not providing financial guidance today. However, I would like to provide some insights, into how we are thinking about Q3 and the rest of the year. Overall, as we plan for the back half of the year, we continue to weigh many factors, including a potential future government stimulus actions, the current shift in personal consumption expenditures from areas like travel and dining out, the possible depth and duration of the pandemic, the risk of continued higher unemployment, and the availability of inventory to match customer demand. With that said, as we enter Q3, there continues to be a heightened demand for the products and services we offer. It is difficult for us to know how sustainable these sales trends are considering the factors I just noted. We are planning for Q3 sales to be higher compared to last year, but likely will not continue at the current level of approximately 20%. We also have plans in place that will allow us to adapt quickly if we needed through the remainder of the year. We anticipate that our Q3 gross profit rate will continue to be pressured compared to last year, as we expect online sales will continue to be a higher percentage of our overall sales mix compared to the prior year. We also expect lower price sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement. As Corie mentioned, we expect our Q3 SG&A dollars to be very similar to last year's Q3. We expect the combination of our pay evolution changes and the store labor hours we have planned for our current operating model will actually result in slightly lower store expense in Q3. We expect this will be offset by higher advertising expense as we prepare for our earlier start to the holiday season as well as increased variable costs from the anticipated revenue growth. On a sequential basis, we expect the increase in SG&A dollars versus Q2 will primarily be driven by increased store labor hours, reinstatement of short-term extended plans and the increase in advertising expense. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Sure. Yes, from a cost reduction standpoint, clearly we did a number of temporary actions and decisions to navigate through Q1 and Q2. As it's been our brand for years, we will continue to look for cost efficiencies to help improve our cost basis. We're in a very unique timeframe right now to determine exactly how much is structural or permanent reductions. And so, we will update people as we go through the remainder of the year and into next year. But we do see permanent savings as we move through this time. It's really difficult to determine exactly how much -- I would say as you move from SG&A into Q3, the sequential change, as we talked about, was really looking at increasing store labor hours with the assumption that stores will be open to customer traffic for the whole quarter. And if you look at store labor hours in total, while we are increasing labor hours for them being open and also, we've also increased the hourly wage rate. So with those two included, we still have store labor hours that are slightly lower than last year. So, we do believe we're finding some leverage as we move into Q3. We did say that Q3 sales are actually going to be higher in Q3, exactly how much, we don't know. But with a similar SG&A level in Q3, with higher sales, we would expect SG&A leverage to continue in Q3, exactly how much we'll determine and by how much sales we actually have and how much gross profit rate pressure we'd be able to offset. Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're evaluating, when we may resume stock buybacks. Fundamentally, our allocation strategy has not changed, we first -- we're always going to reinvest at our business, to do what's right for our customers long-term. We still plan to be a premium dividend payer and at some point return all the excess cash to shareholders. I think, ultimately, you nailed that this is a kind of a very uncertain environment, for many reasons, holidays like we look very different, as like many companies where we're taking the time to really evaluate and when we might resume that. But right now, we like the position we're in, to be able to keep flexibility through the remaining part of this year, but we will certainly readdress that at some point. Hey, Brian. Yes, I think, you've got actually both of the answers and a part of your question. It's a one category that is most dependent on our store traffic for the customer experience to make sense. It's still complicated to do that process online even some of the carrier stores aren't even open 7 days a week right now. So, we are really focused on the customer experience in advance of new handset launches this fall on 5G. We are still very excited about the category and the experience we create. We did make some enhancements so you can trade in your old connected device portfolio online because we're trying to be cognizant of what the customer is going to need. But it's one area where having our stores closed for a big part of the quarter probably played the biggest impact on the performance we just announced. Sure. And getting to the promotional question, I think what I said earlier was promotionally, we'll probably be a little higher in Q3 than it was in Q2 and Q1, but fundamentally still not a pressure on a year-over-year basis. In terms of Q3, we would still expect to see a heightened customer demand and just overall, some level of inventory constraints as we work through the quarter. Clearly, as those change it could affect promotionality. But with those two factors involved, I think we still expect to see promotionality a little, not a pressure on a year-over-year basis. Clearly, the promotional cadence and events could change in Q3 and we -- holiday that will probably start early year. But even with those, we believe the demand for the products and services we sell and just also the inventory availability will continue to lend itself to the less promotional environment."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong quarterly results and we are encouraged to see the customer demand for our products and services. I'm proud of the amazing execution of our teams to these unprecedented times. However, we have not lost sight of the fact that people continue to suffer and we extend our sympathy to all those who have lost someone to the virus, are sick with COVID-19 or are facing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. From the very start of this crisis, we've been focused on the guiding the business with two goals in mind. First, ensuring the health and safety of our customers and employees while protecting the employee experience as much as possible; and second, making certain we come out of this moment, a strong, innovative company. The results we are reporting today would not be possible without the effort and energy of our frontline employees working in our stores, supply chain facilities and customers home. I want to thank all our employees for their tremendous commitment to our customers and for living our purpose to enrich lives through technology. They are navigating not only the impacts of the pandemic, but also fires, hurricanes and civil unrest. Their willingness even enthusiasm to continually adapt as we manage through the evolving environment has been extraordinary. For our second quarter, we are reporting revenue of $9.9 billion, which is growth of approximately 4% from the second quarter of last year. Our Q2, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.71 compared to $1.08 last year. Enterprise comparable sales growth was 5.8%, despite the fact that our stores were opened by appointment-only for the first six weeks of the quarter. Products that help people work, learn, connect and cook at home, like computing, appliances and tablets were the biggest drivers of our sales growth. Trends across most categories improved materially throughout the quarter, as we opened our stores for shopping, especially categories like large appliances and home theater that benefit from more experiential shopping. We also saw very strong digital demand for some of our newer categories such as digital health and fitness, at-home fitness equipment, sustainable living, outdoor activities and camping equipment. While still relatively small categories from a revenue standpoint, they are extremely relevant in today's environment and highlight our ability to leverage our digital first mindset supported by our expertise around curation and supply chain. Throughout the quarter, we experienced inventory constraints in a number of categories, which did moderate our sales growth. While we expected product constraints as we entered the quarter, the stronger-than-anticipated demand as we open our stores for shopping resulted in more constrained product availability than we expected. Turning to profitability. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9% expanded almost 200 basis points from last year, due to materially lower SG&A expense. The lower SG&A is a direct result of balanced but prudent decisions to lower costs in response to the uncertainty of the pandemic and our evolving operating model. That level of lower SG&A, for the most part, is not sustainable as we add labor hours in our stores, reinstate short-term incentive plans and increase advertising spend. Matt will provide more detail later, but we expect Q3 SG&A expense to be more in line with last year's third quarter. I would like to take a moment to recap the evolution of our store operating model. We ended Q1 in a curbside only model with no in-store customer shopping. At the beginning of Q2, we started welcoming customers back into our stores by offering an in-store consultation service to customers by appointment only.  On June 15, we began allowing customers to shop without an appointment at more than 800 stores across the U.S. and as of June 22, almost all of our stores were open for shopping. At that time, approximately half of the 51,000 associates we had in furloughed in April returned. We also resumed our in-home sales consultations, adding to the other in-home services we provide like delivery, installation and repair, we had previously resumed back in May. As we reopened our stores, we saw considerable demand from customers to clearly value and want an in-store shopping experience. Prior to reopening, we were retaining approximately 92% of last years' revenue at the start of Q2. Then, in the last seven weeks of the quarter, total sales grew 16% compared to the same period last year. Trends have remained strong in August, with sales up approximately 20% for the first three weeks of Q3, as customers demand for product special than work, learn and cook. To meet this increased demand, we have now returned approximately two-thirds of the furloughed associates. Throughout this time period and across the ways customers can shop, we have continued to adhere to safety protocols that limit capacity, follow strict social distancing practices and use proper protective equipment, including requiring our employees and customers to wear mask. Like many retailers, we're also operating at reduced store hours, we were operating with approximately 20% fewer hours than last year to match customer demand patterns. This pandemic and the swift shift in customer buying behavior really underscore the importance of our strong multichannel capabilities. For the full quarter, our domestic online revenue grew 240% from last year. Even when stores open for customer shopping, online sales growth continued to be extremely strong, in fact, last seven weeks of the quarter, online revenue grew approximately 180% over the same period last year. Domestic online sales have continued to be very strong in Q3 and are up approximately 175% for the first three weeks of August. We believe it is essentially to provide options that let customers choose what works best for them. We are continuing to provide fulfillment options, customers have come to expect from all retailers like fast and free home delivery, and buy online and pickup in store. We will also continue to provide great experiences like curbside pickup, in-store consultations, and of course, home installation of appliances, TVs, fitness equipments and more. And our digital experiences such as chatting with an expert or leveraging a digital consultation in your home to remain popular options. During the first half of the year, and responding to the pandemic, we made decisions across all these operating models that stressed safety. Although, we temporarily gave up some share while our stores were closed to customer traffic, according to our data, our share has largely recovered since reopening. Most importantly, we made the right decisions for our employees and customers. In Q2, more than 97% of customers surveyed indicated that that we made them feel safe and we believe the credibility we garnered will over time contribute to more brand love and thus more revenue. I would add that since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen elevated growth in the number of new customers. And while it is still early, these new customers are showing a higher likelihood to return than new customers in the prior year period. As we look forward, the environment is still evolving and our operating model and supporting cost structure is evolving as well. The pandemic has accelerated the evolution of retail and compelled us to change our operating model in the best interest of our customers and employees. It has allowed us to expedite some planned strategic changes that will set us up to emerge from this time even stronger. I'd like to provide some insight into our approach, starting with three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers, while also providing more flexible opportunities for our people. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives due to the pandemic. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in bringing tech to life for both customers and our vendor partners. As you would imagine, these concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our business. These implications have been considered as we have made decisions throughout the course of the pandemic and will help our strategy for our future store design, our operating models and our digital investments. We will provide more examples as our plans evolve, but here are some initial thoughts on strategic implications over the next several quarters. From a store standpoint, we have been responding to the impacts from the pandemic in a way that has been enabled by tremendous flexibility at the local level. We are leveraging localized data and analytics that allow us to pilot various services like opening stores an hour earlier for consultations only. Using data and analytics also allows us to quickly and productively customize operations to the local situation if necessary. This is especially important for us to effectively respond should the virus flare up in certain markets. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as a result of the pandemic, we expect it will be higher than it has been historically. As a result, we are starting to evolve the way we use our stores for fulfillment. For example, next month, we will be piloting a ship from store hub model to help handle significant volume pre-holiday and year-round. All our stores will still ship out online orders, but approximately 250 locations will be positioned to ship out significantly more volume. These locations were chosen for their space, proximity to carrier partners and ability to support same and next-day delivery. Over time, this should allow us to deliver a more productive fulfillment model. We are also continuing to add additional third party physical pickup locations for online orders to provide more flexibility and convenience for customers, and now have more than 16,000, covering 85% of the population within five miles. As it relates to our people, we are investing in compensation and beginning to incorporate elements of the flexible workforce, we first introduced at our Investor Day a year ago. We took a major step earlier this month by evolving the pay structure for our store employees and raising the starting wage to $15 per hour. Since the early stages of the pandemic, all hourly retail associates and supply chain employees who were working received incremental hourly appreciation pay. The incremental hourly appreciation pay started March 22 and ended August 1. On August 2, the beginning of our third quarter, we implemented a new pace structure that reflects an ongoing evolution and is the result of clear and consistent feedback from field employees across the country. To provide more predictability and pay, a 4% increase in hourly rate replaced short-term incentive compensation for hourly store employees below the leadership level. After the 4% hourly pay increase, employees were not yet at $15 per hour, had their pay increased to the $15 per hour starting wage. For field leadership and corporate employees, we are reinstituting short-term incentive compensation programs for the back half of the year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've worked in partnership with our company founder, Dick Schulze to provide our employees with emergency financial assistance. Together, we've established two funds totaling more than $10 million, one for the benefit of any full or part-time employee meeting general financial help and a second for those who have become ill with the virus. We are also evolving the way we work to position employees to serve customers, based on need irrespective of channel. A few early examples include our consultation program and our Geek Squad agents. As most of you know, we launched our In-Home Advisor program a few years ago. At that time, the program consistent of highly trained individuals, who were strictly going into customers' homes to provide free comprehensive technology consultations. In May, we developed an in-store appointment engine, as we adapted our operating model to respond to the pandemic. As a result, our In-Home Advisor program has been worked into a consultation across all channels model. We now have a system with tiered advisors, which provides more opportunities for more employees by matching employees with the needs of the customer. And they can provide free consultation in stores, in homes and via phone or chat, depending on customer preferences. Our Geek Squad Agents are not only providing technical support to customers in stores, many of them have also been cross-trained to work in our call centers, providing crucial phone and chat support to solve a variety of customer needs. Another example of the way we are increasing the flexibility of our workforce is our store employees who are making same day deliveries to customers home from 200 of our stores. The examples I just showed have largely stemmed from our response to the pandemic. Going forward, we are on a path to develop a flexible workforce model that leverages technology and provides associates the ability to work whenever and wherever they want. Right now, we are building the foundation by leading our store employees through skills-based training for their existing rules. Overtime, there will be opportunities for employees to gain additional skill sets and be able to fulfill multiple rules which will lead to additional scheduling eligibility and flexibility. From a customer experience standpoint, our strategy is to not only keep pace with, but anticipate changes in customer expectations including safety by adopting a customer accessed approach that is primarily digital. I'll share a few examples of how this is showing up in our app, which saw the number of customer downloads double compared to last year. We are piloting more opportunities for virtual consultation, with our blue-shirts and in-home consultants including abilities to share live video. This is especially critical during the current environment, an increased need for remote consultation and assistance capabilities. We are also expanding our use of augmented reality in the shopping experience, so customers can more easily select the right products based on the space in their homes by using the camera on their own phone. For the in-store experience, we are piloting a self-service in aisle checkout for selected SKUs. This will allow a checkout process that is fast, convenient and involves minimal contact for customers. And for our curbside pickup experience, we are adding functionality that will display information about high and low traffic times and provide digital updates for customers when they are in the parking lot waiting for their curbside orders. We will continue to add features and capabilities to the app to drive frequency, retention and personalization opportunities, all of which are significantly higher in the app than other digital channels. As it relates to the third implication of the pandemic, one of the ways in which technology is playing a more crucial role in our lives is related to health. For Best Buy Health, our focus on digital health, in particular, helping seniors live more independently with our unique combination of tech and touch has become even more relevant as the world responds to the pandemic and concepts like Telehealth become more mainstream. We continue to expand our assortment of health related products and looking forward, see this as an area of technology innovation we are uniquely well suited to help customers navigate. We recently announced to our employees a new President of Best Buy Health, Deborah DiSanzo, who will start in September. Deborah has more than 30 years of experience at the intersection of health care and tech including leading the IBM Watson Health team, where she launched artificial intelligence offerings designed to help doctors, researchers, health care providers, pharmacists and insurers better serve patients around the world. She's also the former CEO of Philips Healthcare where she helped bring consumer-grade automatic defibrillators to the market. She is a recognized thought leader in artificial intelligence and big data. Has deep experience in running businesses known for their innovation in health care and has a demonstrated ability to drive growth both organically and through acquisitions. We are excited to have her lead our strategic work to bring health technology into the home to help people live better, safer and more independent lives. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to talk about our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion in our community. We are always striving to attract and invest in talent that reflects the diversity of all communities and fosters an inclusive culture across the organization. We're powered by the belief that our people matter most and diverse perspectives make us better. Our culture of inclusion values every human beings experience and supports each employee to bring their true and authentic self to work. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. Earlier this year, the human rights campaign named us a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. And Forbes Magazine named us on its list of America's Best Employers for Women. We were also recently named one of Parity.org's best companies for women to advance. In the wake of George Floyd's death and the subsequent protest, Best Buy is committed to doing better when it comes to taking action to address racial inequities and injustices. We've created a diverse task force within the company to help us define and create meaningful change and we will provide visibility to our corresponding commitments in the near future. We've also committed to creating more than 100 Teen Tech Centers to help bridge the opportunity gap and the digital divide for teens in disinvested communities across the country. And we're one of the leaders in a new public-private partnership called Connected Minnesota that will provide computers and Internet access to thousands of youth in our home state. Finally, we have signed on as a founding member of the Parity.org ParityPledge in support of people of color. This is a public commitment to interview at least one qualified person of color for every open leadership role that is at the Vice President level or higher, including the in C-suite and Board of Directors.  In conclusion, we delivered very strong Q2 financial results in an environment that continues to evolve. We are executing well and also clearly seeing benefit from the need for people to connect, work, learn, cook and entertain at home. Looking back it was only five months ago that we closed our stores to customer traffic, drew down the full amount of our revolver, made the difficult decision to furlough associates and saw total sales decline reach 30% at one point. Throughout the pandemic, we have been confident that we will emerge an even stronger company than we were before. Clearly, we are still operating in a dynamic environment, and much uncertainty remains around future outbreaks, government stimulus efforts and the economic impact of sustained high unemployment levels and ongoing shutdowns that vary by industry. We are cognizant of all these factors. At the same time, we are encouraged by our clarity of purpose and our momentum, which has guided and will continue to guide our operating model changes and investments. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant than it has ever been, and we are confident regarding our execution, adaptability and opportunities ahead. We will continue to invest in those capabilities that focus on the customer experience over the long-term and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q2 financial results. Sure. To be clear, in Q2, the primary gross profit rate pressure we saw was coming from supply chain in the form of higher parcel expense. As a reminder, we had 53% of our business done online versus 42% in Q1. So parcel expense is the biggest gross profit rate pressure. And then in addition to that, we continue to see pressure from the lower profit sharing from the city relationship we have. Those are expected to continue into Q3. Promotionally, we actually expected it to be a little bit more promotional going into Q2. It was actually a little less than we actually expected as we work through the quarter. If you look at promotionality into Q3, we would expect that promotionality to be sequentially up from Q1 and Q2, but still not a year-over-year pressure. There are a number of changes to the events and promotions in Q3 that we're obviously working through, but we wouldn't expect to be a year-over-year pressure at this point. Hi, Chris. Thanks for the question. We're seeing favorable trends across literally all of our categories right now as we exit Q2 and start Q3 with the one exception that we noted around mobile phones. But we're seeing trends that are applicable to every part of learning, working, entertaining and cooking from home. And some of that in Corie and Matt's prepared remarks are impacted by the fact we don't have as much inventory as we would like to have right now, but the demand curves that we saw when we opened our stores have continued as we've entered into August well beyond just the traditional back-to-school categories. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color. Peter, I'm going to take that one. I think there are a few -- I would characterize them more as unknowns as we look into the back half here. And I would cite things like where we are in the government aid programs and whether or not there will be a new package going forward. Obviously, the stimulus, to some extent has helped certainly up to this point. And it's hard to say how long that kind of hangover effect of that continues. I think there's questions around overall sustained unemployment levels and also school opening and closing decisions and how long those stretch out in the period. And then, of course, we've highlighted inventory availability and what we feel strongly all of our vendor partners are doing everything they can to catch back up. You're talking about holiday levels on manufacturing and fulfillments, and that just is going to take a bit of time to catch trends this tight. And then finally, the actual duration and depths of the virus and how that proceeds through the fall. And so I think it's less about distinctly calling out categories Peter and a little bit more about just the environment that we find ourselves in. So we believe we continue -- we said it in Q1, we lost some share, and we saw that trend continuing in because our stores were largely closed. And we also said, we view that as very temporal in nature. And you're right, we said in the script that we've seen the share recover. There are puts and takes week-to-week, honestly, Michael. There are some where we actually believe we're gaining. There are others where we think it's a little bit more moderate. Sometimes that can depend on the even inventory position at the time, but overarchingly, we feel pretty strongly that we are in a good share position. And I think our key is that continue to remain incredibly focused on providing the experience that we would expect seamlessly across the channels, still with an emphasis on safety. And we definitely see that in our customer responses. They're very favorably responding to the environment that we're creating. And so I think the team has done a very nice job across however the customer wants to shop meeting their needs. And I think we're very well positioned as we head into Q3 into the back half from a share perspective. Yeah, I think it's one of the reasons we did the walk of our different models in the script, was -- so everyone understood that we operated the first six weeks on an appointment-only model. And obviously, we saw demand for people wanting to come back into our stores. We opened and we said at that point we brought back about half of our furloughed associates. Honestly, the demand was so high as we opened the stores back up that we were not able to provide the level of service that we would have wanted. And you can see it in things like attach rate of services in the store. You could see it in how heavy the business was at our precincts and how many services people wanted to acquire, we literally didn't have enough people in the stores and hours in the stores to be able to handle that kind of demand. Hence the reason we said that by the end of the quarter we had two-thirds of our furloughed associates back in the hours associated with that so we can meet some of that demand. Now you're going to have a fully normalized quarter, where you're going to have both a new starting wage of $15, but also what we think is the labor commensurate to meet the demand and provides a level of service that will help highlight our ability to provide services or financial services, or lease-to-own or many of the other things that come with a full transaction for us. I mean our focus and confidence in the health business remains incredibly strong, and obviously the environment that we find ourselves been only reinforces that strategy. I think Deborah brings just exceptional experience combining technology with healthcare, this idea of tech and touch that we've talked about before, her life experiences in bringing those things together. So I think we found someone who has life experience that very closely aligns with where we think the strategy needs to go. And I wouldn't see the strategic point of view change very much. I just think that we have an ability to continue to accelerate our strategy. Thank you, Anthony, for the compliments. And let me start by saying, one of the implications we laid out in the script were talking that customer shopping behavior has changed permanently. The customer is in charge. So this isn't about being seamless across channels. It's about being seamless, for the customer. And even at our Investor Day last year, we were talking about, how the customer behavior was changing and accelerating, probably even moving faster, than most retailers were. And so we've been building, with this as the assumption, honestly, we've been improving our digital experiences. We've been building a phenomenal and flexible supply chain, and have employees in stores that are moving at speed with the customers. Most of the capabilities that we've used, you hit on curbside, but also in-store consultations, the cross-training in the stores, we do ship from our stores not just the hubs, the hubs will be used to ship larger quantities. And 60% right now of what we're selling is flowing through our stores in some way, either curbside or in-store pickup or shipped from store. And so, this only underscores our belief that our stores are a unique and powerful asset for us. And I think that, what we will see is that the stores maybe used differently. It's not about left stores, but it might be about more points of presence and a different ability to meet the customer. But we do think one of the unique assets that we have, is our ability to move with speed and frankly put the customer in control, to experience us whatever the way they want. Yeah. Obviously, it's early. So, we're still assessing exactly who all these customers are. I think it's at least clear for us that they are customers for whom we may not have been in the consideration set prior. And like we said in the prepared remarks, clearly, it's only been five months, but some of those new customers we obtained in March, have shown a much higher propensity to repeat sales, than those new customers we obtained last year during the same period. Nicely, we have also seen our engaged customers start to rebound as we've reopened stores. So, it's a little bit the best of both worlds, which is why we're so experientially focused on creating the right environment, both safety and choice that will make us appealing for all customers. So we'll continue to peel apart who those customers are, but honestly our bigger priority right now is not just who they are, it's how do we reengage them, how do we continue to bring them into the Best Buy ecosystem and make them a little bit stickier to the brand, which is why we talk about things like brand love, we talk about things like safety because those become the measures by which the brand is valued over time. I'll start, Kate, and maybe Matt can follow with some of that promotional commentary. In terms of the strength, and Mike had said it, we are really seeing broad-based strength. Now clearly, there is a work-from-home, learn-from-home component to this. And especially heading into back to school, you've got right now, estimates are two-thirds of kids doing at home learning. So that combination of learning at home and a lot of parents working from home and shared devices have to be able to have your own networks and own devices and own webcams. And I mean, there's clearly a lot there. And that will be an extended phenomenon as it's going to have kids going back and forth, probably some school to work. But we're also seeing people want to entertain. We talked a little bit about gaming and the demand there we thought that was a category that was going to be well down this year heading into new launches, and it's been performing. And it's not just about gaming consoles; it's about the computing that's used for gaming as well, which has been incredibly strong. Mike talked about televisions and entertainment, and this idea back to sports and being able to start to at least watch sports again on devices. I mean everything that people are doing right now is on the back of technology in their home. And it completely underscores our purpose and our philosophy, and that is you actually right now are enriching your life through technology. And we're seeing it across basically every aspect of what we are selling in our stores. And with that, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 am Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nMollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into the details of our results, on behalf of all of us at Best Buy, I want to extend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to all those who are on the frontlines working to keep us safe or maintain essential services. And we offer our heartfelt sympathy to all those who have lost someone to this virus or who are sick with COVID-19. Today, we are reporting Q1 revenue of $8.56 billion, which is a decline of 6.3% from the first quarter of last year. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.67 compared to $1.02 last year. The Q1 non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.9% was down 90 basis points from last year, primarily due to the operational disruptions caused by the pandemic, which Matt will provide more details on later. This pandemic has changed the way we work, learn, care for ourselves, and importantly connect with each other. Against that backdrop, our purpose has never been more relevant to enrich lives through technology. It is because of that purpose that we were in virtually every jurisdiction with the stay-at-home order in place, designated an essential retailer because of the products and services we offer. I wanted to take a moment to share how Best Buy has been responding and will continue to respond to the crisis we all face. There are scenarios we plan for as business leaders, and then there are events that simply do not have a playbook. This is one of those times, and our leadership team has been responding to events with a focus on keeping our customers and our employees safe, while we meet our customers\u2019 essential needs. At the same time, we are committed to ensuring that as this evolves, Best Buy is well-positioned to thrive in what will almost certainly be a new and very different environment. On March 22, we proactively moved all our stores to a contactless curbside-only model, allowing us to safely serve customers and comply with government orders and recommendations. We also halted all in-home installations, repair, and consultation services choosing to leave the product at or near the doorstep. We did this even in jurisdictions where we were not required to because we believed it was the best way at the time to keep our customers and employees as safe as possible. I am so incredibly proud of our team's ingenuity and execution. They seamlessly implemented a new and highly effective operating model in a matter of 48 hours across our entire store base. As a result, we retained 81% of last year\u2019s sales during the last six weeks of the quarter as we operated in the new model. That's 81% sales retention even though not a single customer set foot in our stores. The strong sales retention is a testament to the strength of our multi-channel capabilities and the strategic investments we have been making over the past several years. It is also a testament to the Best Buy culture and our focus on the customer experience as the entire organization pivoted to execute and support this new model. More than ever, we are fulfilling essential technology needs for customers. In mid-March, we began to see a surge in demand for products that people needed as they complied with stay-at-home orders. That demand continued even after we closed our stores to customer traffic. For the quarter, we saw strong sales growth in computing, gaming, and small appliances. Like many other retailers, we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide. As we entered the second quarter, we continued to shift our operating model as we responded to the evolving environment. On May 4, we began welcoming customers back into our stores to shop Best Buy in innovative ways that follow strict social distancing practices and use proper protective equipment. Specifically, we are offering a new consultation service to our customers in our stores by appointment only. This service allows customers who need to purchase more complex items to schedule an appointment with one of our sales associates at their local Best Buy store where they can get advice tailored to their specific tech needs. Customers can schedule appointments by phone, online, or by simply driving or walking up to a store. We started with approximately 200 stores, and now have almost 700 or about 70% of our domestic stores operating this way. Most of the remaining stores are still operating in the curbside-only model, and approximately 40 stores remain completely closed mainly due to our own decision-making criteria regarding employee and customer safety. Customers have responded very positively to this new way of interacting with us in our stores with 98% of customers surveyed indicating we made them feel safe during the experience. It is very early, but so far the demand has been highest for our large appliances and home theater categories. We are also back in customers\u2019 homes, providing valuable services like large product delivery, installations, and in-home repairs in approximately 80% of US ZIP codes. We are doing this in a new and innovative way, using safety guidelines before, during, and after an in-home visit that meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The key of course, is that we are providing options that let customers choose what works best for them. For the foreseeable future, we will likely employ a variety of models using our local level prowess to customize operations to the local situation. And we will continually evolve those operating models based on guidance from state and local governments as well as our own point of view on the proliferation of the virus and our ability to operate in a way that is safe for our employees and customers. I want to take some time to talk about our employees, clearly the Company's most important asset. From the very first days of the pandemic, we told anyone feeling sick or quarantined that they would keep their job and be paid. We told any employee whose child was home from school that they too would be paid. We gave all field employees who are still serving customers or working in our distribution centers, a temporary pay increase and for all others, we paid their normal salaries for a full month as we took the time to determine how to move forward. Throughout this difficult time of uncertainty and fast-paced change, we have been committed to communicating as often as possible with our employees. This includes conducting surveys on their need for flexibility, as well as their feelings on returning to work, so we can continue to improve our processes, facilitate the deliberate and measured return to corporate workspaces, and accommodate those with pre-existing conditions or safety concerns. Likewise, we built the protocols for returning to customers\u2019 homes and welcoming them back into our stores jointly with our field employees. We have created a robust feedback group and we connect regularly with other field employees to hear how things are going and solicit immediate feedback to challenges they face iterating the experience as we go. We've also continued our focus on providing crucial employee benefits and resources like those for mental and financial health, recognizing that the circumstances we each face are far more stressful than any of us may fully realize. Like most companies, we have had to make tough decisions including those Matt will touch on regarding the ways in which we have cut costs and preserve liquidity to ensure that at the end of this crisis Best Buy remains a strong, vibrant company. I personally want to touch on the difficult decision to furlough employees. While we were pleased to retain more than 80% of our revenue while our stores were closed to customer traffic, the fact remains that we did this without a single store open to customers. Given this fact, it is clear that the current models we are operating simply don't require the staffing our stores had before this crisis began. In that context, on April 19th, we furloughed approximately 51,000 domestic hourly store employees, including nearly all part time employees, we retained approximately 82% of our full time store and field employees on our payroll, including the vast majority of In-Home Advisors, and Geek Squad agents. Additionally, some corporate employees are participating in voluntary reduced work weeks and resulting pay as well as voluntary furloughs. We have done our best to provide these employees with resources and tools to help them navigate a situation that is undoubtedly new to all of them. In keeping with our view that all of us are in this together, I am foregoing 50% of my base salary and the members of the Board of Directors are forgoing 50% of their cash retainer fees. Company executives reporting directly to me are also taking a 20% reduction in base salary. The money saved from these temporary pay reductions is being added to the employee hardship fund we established with our founder, Dick Schulze. This fund was initially created for our furloughed employees as a way of providing them emergency funds, should they be required. I would now like to provide an update from a strategic lens. Last September, we hosted an investor update meeting to provide additional insights into our strategy. Despite the disruption and uncertainty related to COVID-19, we remain focused on executing our Building the New Blue strategy. In many ways, our current way of life in our homes, reliance on technology has only reinforced our belief in our strategic direction. We firmly believe our strategy will uniquely position us over the long term by leveraging our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. Many of these capabilities and initiatives we laid out on stage in September are the muscles we're flexing right now. Our multiyear supply chain transformation has been focused on moving facilities closer to our customers, and using automation and process improvements, to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed, and improve the delivery and installation experience. This has included significantly improving the buy online, pickup in store experience for our customers. At the same time, we have been innovating and designing digital experiences that solve customer needs across online and physical shopping. As a result, the team was very quickly able to stand up a robust and seamless customer experience for both the curbside pickup process and the new in-store consultation process. All of this culminated in domestic online growth of 155% for the quarter. And during the six weeks we ran our curbside-only model, domestic online sales were up more than 300% compared to last year. Almost 50% of those sales were from customers choosing to pick up their products curbside at our stores. Customer satisfaction scores for the curbside pickup experience remained strong with more than 83% of those surveyed indicating they are extremely likely to recommend Best Buy based on their curbside experience. As it relates to supply chain, let me say first that since the beginning of the pandemic, we\u2019ve taken a variety of steps to create the safest possible experience for the employees in our distribution centers, while also ensuring that we're still able to deliver to customers with speed. Additionally, the infrastructure and capabilities we have built to thrive during peak holiday periods is serving us well. Even with the sustained online growth levels of approximately 350% during the last three weeks of the quarter, we did not have material disruptions and maintained our levels of fast service. We will continue to invest in all of these capabilities that focus on the customer experience, and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. We will also of course continue to bring our deep CE expertise and unique ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. In fact, in Q1, we saw a significant increase in demand for our expanded assortment of digital health and fitness products, including things such as at-home fitness equipment, and fitness recovery products that truly empower customers to take care of their own health at home. We believe that not only will technology innovation continue, it will accelerate as a result of the pandemic. We believe many of the customer behavior changes resulting from this type of stay-at-home orders will continue to exist moving forward. Best Buy and our vendor partners are rapidly adjusting our offerings to support these new needs in areas like video conferencing, food preparation and storage, and family entertainment. Turning to our in-home consultation service. In mid-March, we pivoted to provide consultations on a digital basis only. We are proud of the nimble way our team quickly transitioned to this alternative way of interacting with customers. And we're pleased with the number of consultations that took place this way. Because of our investments in the technology backbone, our in-home advisors were able to remain productive during this time and continue to provide customers a high level of consultation service. With our Geek Squad, we are in a unique position to help people productively work and learn in their homes. While overall Q1 interactions with our total tech support customers were down compared to last year, as are in-store and in-home services were unavailable, our remote technical support provided a critically stable support solution through these challenging times. In addition, we've cross trained our Geek Squad agents to work in our call centers, providing crucial phone and chat support to solve a variety of customer needs. We also utilized our Geek Squad agents to support our online customer experience by making same-day deliveries to customers\u2019 homes from 200 of our stores. As we moved back into homes and welcome customers back into our stores, demand for our services has been very high. Turning to Best Buy Health, our focus on health, in particular helping seniors live more independently with our unique combination of tech and touch has become even more relevant as the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, to support our base of over 1 million seniors, we moved quickly to adapt our operations to our caring center agents to support more than 150,000 calls each week while complying with stay-at-home orders. The time spent by our agents on the phone with our customers was above the normal average at over nine minutes per call in many weeks, as we took the time to ensure we are answering questions and addressing requests to our fullest ability. Our service during this period averaged an NPS of 80. And we are incredibly proud of our caring center agents and the empathy with which they serve this vulnerable population, especially during this time. We also have the opportunity to help our commercial partners manage through this time with the help of technology. A recent example is holiday retirement, a leading senior living community where 29,000 residents have been outfitted with our lively mobile personal emergency response or PERS devices. These devices provide access to our emergency response service at the press of a button. We work with Holiday to leverage these devices to efficiently broadcast timely information and protocols related to COVID shelter-in-place to the senior residents. Lastly, we continue to build out our capabilities as we execute our long-term health strategy. Data is an essential currency of this strategy and we recently entered into an important partnership on that front. Validic is an industry-leading technology platform that aggregates data from everyday connected devices in the home, processes it and then provides meaningful insights. Together with Validic, we are bringing to market innovative remote monitoring solutions to better manage chronic health conditions in the home. In conclusion, we entered the year with financial and strategic momentum and a strong balance sheet. We have a suite of assets that allow us to uniquely and safely serve our customers in whatever way they choose, whether that's curbside pickup, free next day shipping, remote technical advice and support, virtual consultations, in-store appointments, in-home installations or doorstep delivery. We know customers and employees will have different shopping expectations anchored in safe environments and processes. We hope to set the standard for safe retailing by constantly adapting our model, leveraging and building on our unique suite of assets. The environment continues to evolve. And while there are many models and a great deal of speculation, there is still a high level of uncertainty at both the micro and macro levels. With that said, we are scenario planning in a way that addresses a number of variables. First, meaningful unemployment will almost certainly be with us through the fiscal year, not necessarily at the level we are seeing now, but enough to likely have a downward macroeconomic effect. Second, it will be important for us and any retailer to have a flexible enough operating model to accommodate the possibility that some states will continue to relax restrictions, while others at the same time may find themselves needing to tighten similar restrictions on how consumers engage with each other and local businesses. Finally, we will continue to prioritize customer and employee safety, advocating for preventative measures, such as social distancing and masks for both customers and employees. It is our belief that these measures will continue into the foreseeable future and will allow us to do what we promise at the very beginning of this crisis. Be there for our customers in as many ways as possible, while ensuring customers and our employees remain as safe as possible. As challenging as the current situation is, I am certain Best Buy will remain a strong vibrant company that is well positioned to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and different environments. In fact, we have taken the opportunity to move faster as this environment accelerates changes in the ways customers want to interact with retailers. For example, we were already preparing to roll out curbside service, store consultations and certified cross training of employees. As such, the implementation of these capabilities is not just a response to the pandemic, they are in fact an acceleration of our existing strategy. Lastly, and very importantly, I want to take this moment to thank the thousands of employees that have made this all possible. They have faced immense change with grit, determination and compassion, and have helped us shape our approach to safe retailing. Many are working with customers every day, some of whom are also scared, frustrated and occasionally hostile in this COVID environment, to ensure they have access to the products and services they need to work, learn, entertain and connect from home. Others are working tirelessly to maintain the supply chain that delivers with speed and keeps our customers at home. And so, many employees are making technical and operational changes every hour from their home office. None of this is possible without their dedication, and I am truly grateful and feel lucky to be on the team with them. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q1 financial results.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning. As Corie described, the pandemic has dramatically changed how we interact with our customers. We are thoughtfully approaching each decision, balancing the safety of our employees and customers while creating long-term value for our shareholders.  Even with the outstanding execution from our employees and a strong customer demand for the essential technology we provide, there is no denying the financial impact the pandemic has had. In Q1, the stay-at-home orders and changes to our operating models resulted in an immediate and complete channel shift that put near term pressure on our operating income rates. Online revenue was up more than 155% year-over-year and was 42% of domestic revenue compared to 15% last year. In a typical quarter, the operating income rate in the store and online channel are very similar, as we find the lower gross profit rate online offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of sales compared to our store channel. In Q1, our enterprise gross profit rate was approximately 70 basis points lower than last year as we incurred higher supply chain costs to fulfill the online sales. In addition, while we took numerous steps to control costs and manage profitability in the quarter, we continued to incur the majority of the cost to run stores, including payroll and rents. In fact, we continued to pay our field associates in some cases at a higher rate through most of the quarter. Therefore, we did not see the SG&A leverage we would expect with a more gradual shift of sales between channels. As a result, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate declined 90 basis points was driven by both a lower gross profit rate and unfavorable SG&A rate compared to last year. Before I talk about our first quarter results in more detail, let me start with a reminder that on March 21st, we withdrew our fiscal '21 guidance for both the first quarter and the full year due to the uncertainty related to the potential impacts associated with COVID-19 pandemic. I would now like to provide additional details on our results versus last year. Starting with how sales trended during the quarter. As we reported in our April 15th press release, our enterprise revenue was up 4% year-over-year for the first seven weeks of the quarter ended March 20th. This was ahead of our regional expectations. As in mid-March, we began to see the surge in demand for products that people needed to work or learn from home, as well as gaming products. In fact, during the eight days ended March 20th, our enterprise revenue grew approximately 25% year-over-year. While we continue to see heightened demand for these products, we materially changed our operating model. And therefore, we began to experience overall revenue declines. As a result, in the first three weeks of the new model from March 21 to April 11, revenue declined approximately 30% compared to last year. In the last three weeks of the quarter from April 12 through May 2nd, sales trends improved as stimulus funding began to circulate. As a result, during that time period, revenue declined approximately 8% compared to last year. In our domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter decreased 6.7% to $7.9 billion. The decrease was driven by comparable sales decline of 5.7% and the loss of revenue from 24 large format stores that were closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. Our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed, or operating in our curbside only operating model during the period as a result of COVID-19. From a merchandise perspective, as Corie mentioned, we saw growth in our computing and gaming categories. This growth was more than offset by declines in home theater, mobile phones and digital imaging. In addition, comparable sales in the services category declined 16%. The decline in services was primarily due to store closures and the corresponding higher mix of online sales, which has a lower attach rate than in-store as well as the fact that we suspended in-home services midway into the quarter. In our international segment, revenue decreased 2.1% to $647 million, primarily driven by approximately 320 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, which was partially offset by revenue from new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. Our international comparable sales were essentially flat to last year, even though all stores in Canada were close to customer traffic for approximately 40% of the quarter, similar to the U.S. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rates declined 70 basis points to 23%. As I stated earlier, the decrease was primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with the higher mix of online revenue. We also saw lower profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement and product mix pressure. But, these impacts were largely offset by lower promotional activity across multiple categories. The impact from the lower profit share revenue was approximately 20 basis points compared to last year. We expect to see continued pressure from lower profit sharing revenue related to our private label and co-branded credit card arrangements, as the economic ramifications of COVID-19 are expected to lead to higher credit card defaults over time. International gross profit rate decreased a 190 basis points to 22.3%, primarily due to lower year-over-year gross profit rates in Canada, the result of a lower mix, higher margin services revenue and higher supply chain costs. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $101 million compared to last year. And as a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased approximately 10 basis points to 19.7%. The largest driver of the expense decline was lower incentive compensation expense of approximately $70 million. The majority of this was related to short-term incentive compensation as we did not pay or accrue bonuses for first quarter performance. We also incurred lower store payroll expense due to the federal CARES Act Employee Retention Tax Credit. As Corie stated, we continued paying all of our store associates through April 18th, whether they were working or not, and we paid hourly incentive pay to employees who were working in our stores and distribution centers. We also incurred additional costs such as safety measures and supplies associated with actions we took in response to the pandemic. In the quarter, we incurred approximately $200 million of costs related to our COVID-19-related actions, or approximately $131 million when including the Employee Retention Credit of $69 million. This Employee Retention Credit is a payroll tax credit for approximately 50% of qualified wages and health benefits paid to retained employees not working as a result of COVID-19. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 27.2% compared to 20.1% last year. The increase versus last year was primarily driven by a decrease in the tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.67 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from the higher tax rate and a negative $0.02 per share impact from higher net interest expense, partially offset by a $0.03 per share benefit from a net share account change. During the first quarter, we returned $203 million to shareholders through $141 million in dividends and $62 million in share repurchases. As we previously communicated, we suspended share repurchases on March 21st. We have taken and are taking a number of additional actions to bolster the balance sheet to provide flexibility, including drawing the full amount of our $1.25 billion credit facility on March 19th. Other actions include lowering merchandise receipts to match demand, which resulted in a 23% decline in our Q1 ending inventory balance compared to last year, reducing promotional and marketing spend to align with our temporary operating model, and suspending our 401(k) company matching program. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we are reducing our spend to focus on mandatory maintenance or high value strategic areas. When we entered the year, our outlook we shared was to spend between $800 million and $900 million in capital expenditures during fiscal \u201821. We now expect the spend in the range of $650 million and $750 million. We remain committed to spend in areas such as technology, automation and our health strategy. We are deferring spend in areas like store remodels and we're reducing the number of stores receiving electronic sign labels this year. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, we are not providing financial guidance at this time. However, I would like to provide some insight into how we're thinking about Q2 and the rest of the year. Our priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and customers while providing essential products and services. We are focused on managing our profitability and liquidity, balancing our short-term decisions to navigate this unprecedented situation, while preserving elements of our strategy that will ensure we remain a vibrant company in the future. For the remainder of the year, there are many factors we're continuing to weigh, including one, the depth and duration of the pandemic; two, the impact of current and potential future government stimulus actions; three, the impact to consumer and growing unemployment; four, the evolution of our various operating models; and five, how and where our customers are choosing to interact with us. It is difficult for us or anyone else for that matter to model how long this continues and the extent to which economy moves into a prolonged recession. In the first two weeks of Q2, we have retained approximately 95% of sales compared to last year. We would expect that our Q2 sales growth rate will likely continue to be pressured throughout the quarter. We also expect our online sales would continue to be high as a percentage of overall sales in the second quarter, which will continue to pressure the gross profit rate. While we do expect to see lower payroll and short term incentive costs, we will continue to have some costs associated with a longer term operating model such as store rent expense, and continued rate pressure from lower profit sharing revenue related to our credit card arrangement. Therefore, we still expect our Q2 operating income rate will decline on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, as Corie mentioned, we will likely employ a variety of operating models during the second quarter, all adapted to the local market conditions and emphasizing safety for our customers and employees. To the extent we're able to increase the level of customer traffic in our stores by expanding hours or opening some stores beyond our current appointment-only model, we may reduce the operating income rate pressure by expanding your gross margins and further leveraging SG&A. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGreg Melich: Hi. Thanks, and great job pulling this all together. I'd love to dig a little more into the supply chain and the inventory down 23%. Could you go into a little bit more on which categories you've been able to secure products and then which ones that you think it might be more challenging, particularly as we think about back-to-school coming up in a couple of months? \nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I'll start and then maybe Mike can jump in. I think, overall we think the teams did an amazing job balancing inventory through the quarter. We've clearly had a number of different sales trajectories through the quarter. So, in the quarter, we likely saw some constraints in some key areas such as computing and gaming, but we were able to manage through that quite well. I think overall, we're pleased with the way the teams managed through inventory. And as we look into Q2, I would say we'll continue to see a little bit of constraints going into the quarter but likely nothing to impact that we saw in Q1. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you have anything?\nMike Mohan: Yes. Thanks, Matt. And Greg, thanks for the question. And maybe, just a little bit of backdrop. Before the pandemic started, we were dealing with the tariff situation from last year. And so, our teams have been working tirelessly around countries of origin and are sourcing from all of our partners. I felt really good as we entered the year as to where we were from an inventory position. Some of the categories that saw the demand spike, freezer saw demand spike, some network equipment saw demand spike, some of the computing products, monitors. Things that you would actually need to work more from home or learn from home were the ones that got constrained and the ones that we\u2019re working the fastest to be back in stock. Based on what we have visibility to and work with our top partners, we feel really good about our inventory position from here going through the balance of the quarter. We now have to plan back to school during the pandemic, which is also new to all of us too. But, I feel good where we're at with the work with our partners.\nGreg Melich: And if I could just follow up on that. What would be the ideal amount of inventory? Was any of that reduction just because sales were down, or was it really just to get into the supply? Would you like inventory to be flat year-over-year?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I think it's a balance to answer that question. We clearly reduced inventory to match the sales trajectory, but we also wanted to make sure we're finding the inventory for the products that were in high demand, like computing. And so, you tend to look for areas that aren\u2019t -- where the trajectory is not as high, and you right size as much as you can and continue to find the products that are in high demand. So, ideally we'd like to have more computing in -- some more inventory in some areas, because we probably could have seen more sales if had -- we had it is the answer.\nGreg Melich: That's great. Good luck to everyone. Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now move to our next question from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations, obviously, on working through a very volatile time.\nCorie Barry: Thank you, Karen.\nKaren Short: So, I just wanted to ask a little bit on I guess the reintroduction of services. I guess, could you give a little color on the demand you're seeing for IHAs and also total tech support. Because I guess there's two sides of the debate, which is one that pent-up demand that got pulled into 1Q. But then, the other side of it is, people could do wholesale, like home office reconfigurations just beyond a replacement laptop or printer, I mean, even more complicated types of overhaul. So, if you could give a little color on that, and then I had another follow-up.\nCorie Barry: So, I\u2019ll try to give a little color on both TTS and IHA. So, we talked about it a bit in the script. We did definitely see some usage, but the majority of it was remote or via chats and call, because obviously you couldn't come into the stores and we couldn't go into your homes. And so, not only were we constrained by a bit of what you're talking about, Karen, which is you can only put so much to your home office together, we were also just constrained by the way we were operating. And I think we've talked about this before, this severe of a channel shift makes service sales harder than when we have our stores open and when we have a chance to provide that service. We are definitely seeing pent-up demand as we start to open up our stores to the appointment model. Many of the appointments being made are people who want to come in and bring, especially as you can imagine home office or phone products in for us to help take care of them. And we can also see as we're going back into people's homes where the demand and request for us to come to their homes to fix things like refrigerators, laundry, that has been very high. And so, I think there is definitely pent-up demand there as we\u2019re heading into Q2 and the team is finding new ways to serve that. On the IHA side of things, it was very interesting. The team across all of our in-home businesses has been very flexibly trying to serve customers, either digitally, phone, chat, any way that they can. They moved -- IHA moved to digital consultations in mid-March. Our IHAs are also helping with this really heavy volume of inbound sales calls and chats, and they are also helping with the new in-store consultation model. Before you come to the store, we actually have a pre-call. And our In-Home Advisors in some cases are helping with that pre-call because we can really figure out what it is that a customer needs. I will say, if I just were to give a couple data points, in April, we saw our IHA business was actually up. And over 60% of that was coming from chat and digital channel. And that through those channels, those virtual consultations was at a 91 NPS. So, this idea that we can more flexibly use the in-home resources, not just physically in people's homes, but in a more virtual consultative way is really, really interesting and something that I think will be a muscle we can see the flex as we go forward.\nKaren Short: Actually that leads into my next question. I mean, looking at your very strong retention rates that have only gotten better, but also pairing that with the e-com now at 42% of sales, I guess, I'm wondering how you think about evaluating the physical store base going forward, just more broadly?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I will start with, our stores are absolutely an asset, and they have been an asset throughout this. And I\u2019ll just use a data point in April, 65% of what we sold online, which is the vast majority of what we sold, was either pickup curbside or shipped from a store. And so, this asset of the store base is very real. Now, you can imagine what we're discerning is how might the stores look and work differently in the future? And how might they provide a variety of fulfillment options, a variety of service and high touch consultative options, like this opens a lot of doors for how your stores might work differently. And that's where our focus is at this point.\nKaren Short: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Curtis Nagle from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Curtis Nagle from Bank of America, please ensure you're not on mute. We currently can't hear you.\nCurtis Nagle: Apologies. I was on mute. Thanks very much for taking the question. Corie, maybe just quickly, just digging back into the point on sales in May so far. So, down, I guess about only 5% that is an acceleration, really, really impressive numbers. Would you be able to talk about what's driving that? Is that further acceleration in online, better curbside? I mean, what's going on there?\nCorie Barry: I'll start. And then, maybe Matt can add more color because I'm sure I\u2019ll miss something. I think there's a lot that's going on there. So, curbside, even if you look at the original retention we announced at the beginning of curbside, which is around 70%, you can tell that accelerate because by the end of the quarter, we were already at 81%. And so, just I think the performance overarching, we have curbside, the teams were amazingly creative and thoughtful about how they implemented that and definitely got better and better and better at providing that service. We also were very clear that stimulus dollars that started to flow towards the end of the quarter were absolutely helpful. And those lines strongly believe are carrying in Q2 here. It\u2019s not all the checks have yet been distributed, although the vast majority now of that money is out there. But we definitely see those stimulus starts buoying the level of demand. And then, I think people continue to have more needs as they spend more and more time in their homes. The initial demand will be definitely around working and learning from home. And this new appointment model, what we're starting to see is there is also demand for cooking. And importantly, I think we all feel it, entertaining at home and creating new and different entertaining theaters, kind of what we've seen in gaming. And so, I think there is also that once you layer on a little bit of a point [Technical Difficulty], you also start to see the demand for some of the other aspects of what it means to be sheltering in place time. Matt, I don\u2019t know if you anything to add?\nMatt Bilunas: No. I would say, -- I think just in general too, as we become more proficient in our model and customers are more comfortable as they engage with us. I think there's a general improvement in our execution and just how customers learning how to shop in this new environment.\nCorie Barry: Yes. I think that\u2019s a really good point I would just lift up. Our teams have done an amazing job on awareness to how to shop. If you go to our website, we have literally a whole site that just walks through all the different ways in which you can interact with Best Buy, and then what's applicable depending on your geography. And you can imagine that's going to take some time for our customers to understand and actually have awareness of all the different ways they can shop Best Buy.\nCurtis Nagle: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, maybe just a quick one and perhaps its\u2019 a bit early to comment on. But, could you talk a little bit about some of the changes you might be making in terms of your in-store product assortment to maybe better cater to people living and staying in their homes more? You'd mentioned health products or fitness products as an example. Yes. How could the stores change over the kind of the coming months, years going forward?\nMike Mohan: Hey. Curtis, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start and Matt or Corie can chime in. We look at the customer demand signals all the time. And what I think is interesting during this pandemic, the idea of we\u2019re trying to play and I'm going specific to health, we've always had an insight that acknowledges we\u2019re playing a strong role in helping enrich people's lives, and I was at a predisposition around acquisition of GreatCall, how we thought about that space. And people are really thinking about what else they should or could be doing at home. Things in that space definitely have propped. It\u2019s still a small business for us. But that's why we got into the fitness category last year, because that has been significantly in their demand. But, then things oxygen sensors, thermometers and things that you would want to do to just to check and maintain your health becoming more important because those devices, while they serve a need are now starting to check other things consumers are highly interested in, which I think bodes extremely well for Best Buy. The gaming resurgence was a bit of a surprise, I'll be candid. Everyone had thought that gaming category was going to wait for this fall for the new console resets. But clearly, if you have kids at home and you cannot be the best teacher in the world, a substitute has become a Nintendo Switch or an Xbox or Playstation. And that's new demand. And we think that demand will actually be leading to stronger demand as the year progresses with new devices. And the category that I'm intrigued about as we get back to people working with us that we're going into their homes, so we intend to go back into people's homes with IHAs in early June. But as people come to our stores for consultations, is people thinking about how to update the way they prepare food and store it and how they're thinking about entertainment. So, the categories that we're really good at, these complex, highly consultative sales, I think there's some good opportunities in our assortment there. Maybe more curated but also serving customers\u2019 needs more specifically as they look for doing different things.\nCorie Barry: The only thing that I would add is to build on Karen Short\u2019s question just a little bit. I think the complex, full home office and learning solutions will also continue. I think, people have been piecing together kind of what they can to make it work, as I believe work from home becomes a more sustainable practice. I think, these more fulsome approaches to home office will be really important.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets, Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scott Ciccarelli. You guys talk about getting a from the stimulus checks. That makes sense. I think a lot of companies did. But, do you have any way to estimate the amount of pull forward demand you may have benefited from in the quarter as you try and kind of think about the balance of the year?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I\u2019ll start, and maybe Mike or Corie can jump in. I think, we actually don't believe there was much pull forward into the quarter. I think, if you think about the types of products we were selling, there\u2019s continued sustained demand that we're seeing. I think people's lives have also changed in a way that demand that they probably didn't know they had before, they now have in a new world where technology at home is more important, things like monitors at home that you may not have -- would have bought. So, I think -- we actually think a lot of what we\u2019re seeing or most of what we're seeing is not pull forward as much as it is incremental to an otherwise different situation. \nCorie Barry: I think, Mike\u2019s gaming example is the perfect one, meaning that\u2019s not pull forward demand. That\u2019s demand that would not have existed. People would not have bought those gaming consoles. They would have waited for the next generation of consoles to come in December. But because you're in this unique life situation, there's real incremental demand there. And I think that's the perfect example of what we're seeing.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. And then, as you talk with your vendors, obviously, you've had a lot of discussions with them, given some of your inventory commentary. Everyone's been on hold, right? So, based on what you know at this point, is there any kind of change to what's called the product introduction outlook as you discussed with your vendors, kind of the way they're thinking about the balance of the year? Thanks.\nMike Mohan: Scot, it's Mike. No, I don't see any change to some of the known parts of everyday. There's lots of things that even we don't know. But, we made a statement in the script. We think innovation is going to accelerate. There are some product categories in the ways that things come to light that I think are meaningful. I mean, literally four months ago, most people who had front-facing video camera on their laptop was putting a piece of paper over it. And now you need a higher resolution camera, and better set of speakers and microphone because you need to be more productive and doing video conferencing. So, I'm actually pretty excited about maybe some additional innovation or some product revs that we could help accelerate and commercialize and bring to market.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Many thanks.\nMike Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious, if you could give us an update on your lease to own effort, presumably something that's been more challenging to facilitate with kind of limited store operations. But, how do you see that evolving, especially with underbanked consumers, maybe feeling their wallets pinched a bit? And, any commentary on what you were able to see during the quarter? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Yes, absolutely. I think, the ability to provide another purchasing option for customers is critically important, especially in this very uncertain time for most people. The reality is in this quarter, currently customers can only purchase through lease to own in our stores. And so, it obviously hasn't made that program advanced too much in the quarter. We're still expecting to launch it online this year and I think that\u2019s in July. So, we're still very pleased about the relationships, we're still very excited about the opportunity to provide and extending more financing to more people and the customers that it might attract. But clearly, in a quarter, a bit of a disruption just due to the fact that our stores were closed to foot traffic for half of it.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Yes. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. Since the pandemic started, have you seen any evidence of trade down? Obviously, you're seeing indications of demand across categories. But, any indications in terms of moving towards smaller versions of appliances or less features or last year's models, or anything like that that would indicate consumer caution? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: I\u2019ll start and Mike can pile on. I don't -- we really for the most part have not. Now, back to what Mike said about the need around your home office or the need around learning, when you're purchasing in that very kind of needs-based way, it's less about trying to trade down, it's more about trying to figure out what exactly is going to fulfill the need for you in your home. That's actually we\u2019re seeing in cooking and preparing food at home, we\u2019re seeing it in learning in office at home. And so, I think for us, we're actually right now seeing the demand is across the profile of what we sell, and in fact, in some spaces even higher in some of the higher end computing. I think, one of the things that's selling really well in computing is high computing, that\u2019s gaming computing. In gaming computing, is actually some of the highest end products that we sell. And you can definitely see that people as they get bored in their home are looking for some ways to entertain themselves and have not been looking for the cheapest way to do that.\nMike Mohan: The only thing I'd add Jonathan is during the timeframe a couple of the mass channel retailers were open. So, from an assortment and a comparability standpoint, consumers didn't have a wholesome shopping experience. There's a couple of examples where on constrained products, there probably was some ASP erosion based on the fact that all you had were lower price items. And that sometimes is very temporary where somebody would trade down, but that's not indicative of a long-term trend in any way, shape or form. The best example is having consultations back in place for the some hundred stores, and the interest level we're seeing for consumers in some of our more complex categories.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Really helpful. Thanks for the color.\nMike Mohan: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nJoe Feldman: Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. I want to follow-up on the CapEx reduction. I know you described a little bit on the call, but -- in the prepared remarks. But can you help us better understand, like, what are you cutting and what are you keeping? I mean, because it's a vast majority of it, you're still going to be spending this year. I'm just wondering where that is relative to the cuts. Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I\u2019ll start. And maybe Corie and Mike can jump in. I think where we've tried to cut from a CapEx perspective is mostly around discretionary, non-essential things. And actually, the fact that our stores have been closed to foot traffic for quite a while, I think there's some things that like store remodels don't make as much sense in the middle of what we're dealing with as they would otherwise. So, store remodels have been paused. We've lowered the amount of electronic sign labels that we were going to put in our stores, simply because there's an issue of just when we can actually accomplish that in the year. So, there's more discretionary items that are as essential during this period that we've decided to pull back on. But there's a continuation of strategies because we still believe we are very relevant to the customer and our strategies are very applicable going forward, if not more. So, there's things like automation and just dotcom technology and other things that we are just as passionate as we were before about it. And we will continue to invest where we can to drive and accelerate our strategies.\nCorie Barry: We said it on the call, our investment in digital and supply chain automation technologies are a huge part of what allowed us to first move to curbside and then set up appointment based scheduling. Both of those required heavy digital builds behind the scenes in order to make an app as an example ready for a customer to make an appointment or for an employee to be able to see who's in the queue waiting for an appointment. And we believe continued investment in those experiences that are going to deliver choice to customers and continue to deliver with speed are absolutely crucial to maintaining our positioning as the year goes on here.\nJoe Feldman: Thanks. And if I could ask you one more? With regard to the 40 stores that are closed, I know you guys decided to close those and they still remain closed. Will those reopen or are you thinking those were kind of weaker stores that you may take advantage of the situation and keep them closed for now?\nCorie Barry: No, they're not weaker stories. These are literally for the most part it\u2019s us looking at kind of spread of the virus and our available employee population. In a lot of cases, they are actually some of the bigger stores, on the East Coast you can imagine are some that we've either closed or in a couple of situations we still have some government mandates. But don\u2019t take those 40 as they're underperforming. These are literally 40 that just it makes a lot of sense based on health, safety and government regulations.\nJoe Feldman: Thanks. And good luck with this quarter, guys. Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. First, a strategic question on healthcare initiatives. It feels like -- it seems like it's a pretty good moment to advance some of those strategies. Can you talk about anything with regard to user trend, level of interest in those business models and the degree to which you can accelerate some of those -- some of that business segment?\nCorie Barry: I'm going to start by building on where Mike had left off, on the consumer side of health. And I'm going to think about this writ large, everything from kind of health and fitness, all the way to taking your temperature and blood pressure cuffs. There is significant demand for technology that will help us maintain and monitor our health at home. And we have seen that across the board. And this is just hypothesis. But my personal hypothesis would be back to the point we were talking about earlier, the level of innovation in health at home is only going to accelerate from here. Not just because people want it but also because what you've seen is a change in reimbursement for telehealth at the overarching kind of government level. And so, that combination of things is incredibly powerful on the consumer side. Now, of course, it\u2019s a little tricky there as it relates to specifically our GreatCall devices, the phones, the wearable devices, much of those sales go through our stores. And so, without our stores physically being open, it's little harder to transact that online. So, but in the moment pressure we're feeling is a little bit around our stores not being open. But the potential for devices that are going to keep us connected to our -- especially elderly loved ones right now and also just keep us connected is incredibly high. We hit a little bit on the commercial side in the script. You can imagine there's a great deal of interest around how at a much broader scale we can monitor people's health and take care of them in their homes. If this pandemic has highlighted anything, it is keeping people at home as long as possible, but it's also tracking their vitals, tracking how they're feeling is incredibly important. So, the potential on commercial I think has come to light even faster. And this was our hypothesis that more people would need to have more care in their homes on the back of technology. And I think this has accelerated that hypothesis meaningfully.\nSimeon Gutman: Makes sense. Can I follow up on gross margin? The pressure you saw related to supply chain, the mix shift, was that normal course of mix shift or this was a triage situation? And then, the other question is the credit card. Is there any way you can dimensionalize the impact from lower profit share? I realize you did this quarter, but the go forward, if delinquencies grow a certain percentage, we could see a certain percentage impact to your P&L?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. Thank you. On the gross margin side channel, so obviously in the quarter, about halfway through, we shifted to filling mostly through -- or actually selling mostly through online channel and fulfilling through our stores in the large percentage of cases. When that happens, if you incur a much higher personal expense, even though a large number of customers are still deciding to come pick up at our stores, and actually our stores are stilling fulfilling a large percent of those products, almost 65% of what's actually happening in the quarter was either picked up at our stores curbside and/or shipped out of our stores. So, with that parcel costs just go up. That's kind of a variable cost of online. It wasn't abnormal with that shift. It was just the normal shift to that channel when it happens. So, we would expect that to continue as we look into Q2. Obviously half of our Q1 was under the old model, then we had -- saw the dramatic increase. We still expect online, as we said, to be significantly higher in Q2, which would means we would incur some additional parcel costs and more gross profit pressure because of it. We have never given on the financing profit share. We've never given the actual number what the profit share is. We did discuss or say that it was 20 basis points of pressure in Q1. I think, we also believe it will be a pressure in Q2. I would expect it to be pretty consistent, if not, maybe a little bit more in Q2, as you look forward. Hard to know how that plays out for the whole year because a big part of this has to do with the macro and unemployment, and we are -- little too early to tell how much that actually is going to be an impact for the year. But we would expect it to be a pressure.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thank you. Good luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you so much. And with that, I think that ends our call for today. Thank you all so much for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our progress again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning. As Corie described, the pandemic has dramatically changed how we interact with our customers. We are thoughtfully approaching each decision, balancing the safety of our employees and customers while creating long-term value for our shareholders.  Even with the outstanding execution from our employees and a strong customer demand for the essential technology we provide, there is no denying the financial impact the pandemic has had. In Q1, the stay-at-home orders and changes to our operating models resulted in an immediate and complete channel shift that put near term pressure on our operating income rates. Online revenue was up more than 155% year-over-year and was 42% of domestic revenue compared to 15% last year. In a typical quarter, the operating income rate in the store and online channel are very similar, as we find the lower gross profit rate online offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of sales compared to our store channel. In Q1, our enterprise gross profit rate was approximately 70 basis points lower than last year as we incurred higher supply chain costs to fulfill the online sales. In addition, while we took numerous steps to control costs and manage profitability in the quarter, we continued to incur the majority of the cost to run stores, including payroll and rents. In fact, we continued to pay our field associates in some cases at a higher rate through most of the quarter. Therefore, we did not see the SG&A leverage we would expect with a more gradual shift of sales between channels. As a result, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate declined 90 basis points was driven by both a lower gross profit rate and unfavorable SG&A rate compared to last year. Before I talk about our first quarter results in more detail, let me start with a reminder that on March 21st, we withdrew our fiscal '21 guidance for both the first quarter and the full year due to the uncertainty related to the potential impacts associated with COVID-19 pandemic. I would now like to provide additional details on our results versus last year. Starting with how sales trended during the quarter. As we reported in our April 15th press release, our enterprise revenue was up 4% year-over-year for the first seven weeks of the quarter ended March 20th. This was ahead of our regional expectations. As in mid-March, we began to see the surge in demand for products that people needed to work or learn from home, as well as gaming products. In fact, during the eight days ended March 20th, our enterprise revenue grew approximately 25% year-over-year. While we continue to see heightened demand for these products, we materially changed our operating model. And therefore, we began to experience overall revenue declines. As a result, in the first three weeks of the new model from March 21 to April 11, revenue declined approximately 30% compared to last year. In the last three weeks of the quarter from April 12 through May 2nd, sales trends improved as stimulus funding began to circulate. As a result, during that time period, revenue declined approximately 8% compared to last year. In our domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter decreased 6.7% to $7.9 billion. The decrease was driven by comparable sales decline of 5.7% and the loss of revenue from 24 large format stores that were closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. Our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed, or operating in our curbside only operating model during the period as a result of COVID-19. From a merchandise perspective, as Corie mentioned, we saw growth in our computing and gaming categories. This growth was more than offset by declines in home theater, mobile phones and digital imaging. In addition, comparable sales in the services category declined 16%. The decline in services was primarily due to store closures and the corresponding higher mix of online sales, which has a lower attach rate than in-store as well as the fact that we suspended in-home services midway into the quarter. In our international segment, revenue decreased 2.1% to $647 million, primarily driven by approximately 320 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, which was partially offset by revenue from new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. Our international comparable sales were essentially flat to last year, even though all stores in Canada were close to customer traffic for approximately 40% of the quarter, similar to the U.S. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rates declined 70 basis points to 23%. As I stated earlier, the decrease was primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with the higher mix of online revenue. We also saw lower profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement and product mix pressure. But, these impacts were largely offset by lower promotional activity across multiple categories. The impact from the lower profit share revenue was approximately 20 basis points compared to last year. We expect to see continued pressure from lower profit sharing revenue related to our private label and co-branded credit card arrangements, as the economic ramifications of COVID-19 are expected to lead to higher credit card defaults over time. International gross profit rate decreased a 190 basis points to 22.3%, primarily due to lower year-over-year gross profit rates in Canada, the result of a lower mix, higher margin services revenue and higher supply chain costs. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $101 million compared to last year. And as a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased approximately 10 basis points to 19.7%. The largest driver of the expense decline was lower incentive compensation expense of approximately $70 million. The majority of this was related to short-term incentive compensation as we did not pay or accrue bonuses for first quarter performance. We also incurred lower store payroll expense due to the federal CARES Act Employee Retention Tax Credit. As Corie stated, we continued paying all of our store associates through April 18th, whether they were working or not, and we paid hourly incentive pay to employees who were working in our stores and distribution centers. We also incurred additional costs such as safety measures and supplies associated with actions we took in response to the pandemic. In the quarter, we incurred approximately $200 million of costs related to our COVID-19-related actions, or approximately $131 million when including the Employee Retention Credit of $69 million. This Employee Retention Credit is a payroll tax credit for approximately 50% of qualified wages and health benefits paid to retained employees not working as a result of COVID-19. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 27.2% compared to 20.1% last year. The increase versus last year was primarily driven by a decrease in the tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.67 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from the higher tax rate and a negative $0.02 per share impact from higher net interest expense, partially offset by a $0.03 per share benefit from a net share account change. During the first quarter, we returned $203 million to shareholders through $141 million in dividends and $62 million in share repurchases. As we previously communicated, we suspended share repurchases on March 21st. We have taken and are taking a number of additional actions to bolster the balance sheet to provide flexibility, including drawing the full amount of our $1.25 billion credit facility on March 19th. Other actions include lowering merchandise receipts to match demand, which resulted in a 23% decline in our Q1 ending inventory balance compared to last year, reducing promotional and marketing spend to align with our temporary operating model, and suspending our 401(k) company matching program. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we are reducing our spend to focus on mandatory maintenance or high value strategic areas. When we entered the year, our outlook we shared was to spend between $800 million and $900 million in capital expenditures during fiscal \u201821. We now expect the spend in the range of $650 million and $750 million. We remain committed to spend in areas such as technology, automation and our health strategy. We are deferring spend in areas like store remodels and we're reducing the number of stores receiving electronic sign labels this year. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, we are not providing financial guidance at this time. However, I would like to provide some insight into how we're thinking about Q2 and the rest of the year. Our priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and customers while providing essential products and services. We are focused on managing our profitability and liquidity, balancing our short-term decisions to navigate this unprecedented situation, while preserving elements of our strategy that will ensure we remain a vibrant company in the future. For the remainder of the year, there are many factors we're continuing to weigh, including one, the depth and duration of the pandemic; two, the impact of current and potential future government stimulus actions; three, the impact to consumer and growing unemployment; four, the evolution of our various operating models; and five, how and where our customers are choosing to interact with us. It is difficult for us or anyone else for that matter to model how long this continues and the extent to which economy moves into a prolonged recession. In the first two weeks of Q2, we have retained approximately 95% of sales compared to last year. We would expect that our Q2 sales growth rate will likely continue to be pressured throughout the quarter. We also expect our online sales would continue to be high as a percentage of overall sales in the second quarter, which will continue to pressure the gross profit rate. While we do expect to see lower payroll and short term incentive costs, we will continue to have some costs associated with a longer term operating model such as store rent expense, and continued rate pressure from lower profit sharing revenue related to our credit card arrangement. Therefore, we still expect our Q2 operating income rate will decline on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, as Corie mentioned, we will likely employ a variety of operating models during the second quarter, all adapted to the local market conditions and emphasizing safety for our customers and employees. To the extent we're able to increase the level of customer traffic in our stores by expanding hours or opening some stores beyond our current appointment-only model, we may reduce the operating income rate pressure by expanding your gross margins and further leveraging SG&A. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Sure. I'll start and then maybe Mike can jump in. I think, overall we think the teams did an amazing job balancing inventory through the quarter. We've clearly had a number of different sales trajectories through the quarter. So, in the quarter, we likely saw some constraints in some key areas such as computing and gaming, but we were able to manage through that quite well. I think overall, we're pleased with the way the teams managed through inventory. And as we look into Q2, I would say we'll continue to see a little bit of constraints going into the quarter but likely nothing to impact that we saw in Q1. Mike, I don't know if you have anything? Yes. I think it's a balance to answer that question. We clearly reduced inventory to match the sales trajectory, but we also wanted to make sure we're finding the inventory for the products that were in high demand, like computing. And so, you tend to look for areas that aren't -- where the trajectory is not as high, and you right size as much as you can and continue to find the products that are in high demand. So, ideally we'd like to have more computing in -- some more inventory in some areas, because we probably could have seen more sales if had -- we had it is the answer. Thank you. No. I would say, -- I think just in general too, as we become more proficient in our model and customers are more comfortable as they engage with us. I think there's a general improvement in our execution and just how customers learning how to shop in this new environment. Yes. I'll start, and maybe Mike or Corie can jump in. I think, we actually don't believe there was much pull forward into the quarter. I think, if you think about the types of products we were selling, there's continued sustained demand that we're seeing. I think people's lives have also changed in a way that demand that they probably didn't know they had before, they now have in a new world where technology at home is more important, things like monitors at home that you may not have -- would have bought. So, I think -- we actually think a lot of what we're seeing or most of what we're seeing is not pull forward as much as it is incremental to an otherwise different situation. Sure. Yes, absolutely. I think, the ability to provide another purchasing option for customers is critically important, especially in this very uncertain time for most people. The reality is in this quarter, currently customers can only purchase through lease to own in our stores. And so, it obviously hasn't made that program advanced too much in the quarter. We're still expecting to launch it online this year and I think that's in July. So, we're still very pleased about the relationships, we're still very excited about the opportunity to provide and extending more financing to more people and the customers that it might attract. But clearly, in a quarter, a bit of a disruption just due to the fact that our stores were closed to foot traffic for half of it. Sure. I'll start. And maybe Corie and Mike can jump in. I think where we've tried to cut from a CapEx perspective is mostly around discretionary, non-essential things. And actually, the fact that our stores have been closed to foot traffic for quite a while, I think there's some things that like store remodels don't make as much sense in the middle of what we're dealing with as they would otherwise. So, store remodels have been paused. We've lowered the amount of electronic sign labels that we were going to put in our stores, simply because there's an issue of just when we can actually accomplish that in the year. So, there's more discretionary items that are as essential during this period that we've decided to pull back on. But there's a continuation of strategies because we still believe we are very relevant to the customer and our strategies are very applicable going forward, if not more. So, there's things like automation and just dotcom technology and other things that we are just as passionate as we were before about it. And we will continue to invest where we can to drive and accelerate our strategies. Yes. Thank you. On the gross margin side channel, so obviously in the quarter, about halfway through, we shifted to filling mostly through -- or actually selling mostly through online channel and fulfilling through our stores in the large percentage of cases. When that happens, if you incur a much higher personal expense, even though a large number of customers are still deciding to come pick up at our stores, and actually our stores are stilling fulfilling a large percent of those products, almost 65% of what's actually happening in the quarter was either picked up at our stores curbside and/or shipped out of our stores. So, with that parcel costs just go up. That's kind of a variable cost of online. It wasn't abnormal with that shift. It was just the normal shift to that channel when it happens. So, we would expect that to continue as we look into Q2. Obviously half of our Q1 was under the old model, then we had -- saw the dramatic increase. We still expect online, as we said, to be significantly higher in Q2, which would means we would incur some additional parcel costs and more gross profit pressure because of it. We have never given on the financing profit share. We've never given the actual number what the profit share is. We did discuss or say that it was 20 basis points of pressure in Q1. I think, we also believe it will be a pressure in Q2. I would expect it to be pretty consistent, if not, maybe a little bit more in Q2, as you look forward. Hard to know how that plays out for the whole year because a big part of this has to do with the macro and unemployment, and we are -- little too early to tell how much that actually is going to be an impact for the year. But we would expect it to be a pressure."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into the details of our results, on behalf of all of us at Best Buy, I want to extend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to all those who are on the frontlines working to keep us safe or maintain essential services. And we offer our heartfelt sympathy to all those who have lost someone to this virus or who are sick with COVID-19. Today, we are reporting Q1 revenue of $8.56 billion, which is a decline of 6.3% from the first quarter of last year. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.67 compared to $1.02 last year. The Q1 non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.9% was down 90 basis points from last year, primarily due to the operational disruptions caused by the pandemic, which Matt will provide more details on later. This pandemic has changed the way we work, learn, care for ourselves, and importantly connect with each other. Against that backdrop, our purpose has never been more relevant to enrich lives through technology. It is because of that purpose that we were in virtually every jurisdiction with the stay-at-home order in place, designated an essential retailer because of the products and services we offer. I wanted to take a moment to share how Best Buy has been responding and will continue to respond to the crisis we all face. There are scenarios we plan for as business leaders, and then there are events that simply do not have a playbook. This is one of those times, and our leadership team has been responding to events with a focus on keeping our customers and our employees safe, while we meet our customers' essential needs. At the same time, we are committed to ensuring that as this evolves, Best Buy is well-positioned to thrive in what will almost certainly be a new and very different environment. On March 22, we proactively moved all our stores to a contactless curbside-only model, allowing us to safely serve customers and comply with government orders and recommendations. We also halted all in-home installations, repair, and consultation services choosing to leave the product at or near the doorstep. We did this even in jurisdictions where we were not required to because we believed it was the best way at the time to keep our customers and employees as safe as possible. I am so incredibly proud of our team's ingenuity and execution. They seamlessly implemented a new and highly effective operating model in a matter of 48 hours across our entire store base. As a result, we retained 81% of last year's sales during the last six weeks of the quarter as we operated in the new model. That's 81% sales retention even though not a single customer set foot in our stores. The strong sales retention is a testament to the strength of our multi-channel capabilities and the strategic investments we have been making over the past several years. It is also a testament to the Best Buy culture and our focus on the customer experience as the entire organization pivoted to execute and support this new model. More than ever, we are fulfilling essential technology needs for customers. In mid-March, we began to see a surge in demand for products that people needed as they complied with stay-at-home orders. That demand continued even after we closed our stores to customer traffic. For the quarter, we saw strong sales growth in computing, gaming, and small appliances. Like many other retailers, we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide. As we entered the second quarter, we continued to shift our operating model as we responded to the evolving environment. On May 4, we began welcoming customers back into our stores to shop Best Buy in innovative ways that follow strict social distancing practices and use proper protective equipment. Specifically, we are offering a new consultation service to our customers in our stores by appointment only. This service allows customers who need to purchase more complex items to schedule an appointment with one of our sales associates at their local Best Buy store where they can get advice tailored to their specific tech needs. Customers can schedule appointments by phone, online, or by simply driving or walking up to a store. We started with approximately 200 stores, and now have almost 700 or about 70% of our domestic stores operating this way. Most of the remaining stores are still operating in the curbside-only model, and approximately 40 stores remain completely closed mainly due to our own decision-making criteria regarding employee and customer safety. Customers have responded very positively to this new way of interacting with us in our stores with 98% of customers surveyed indicating we made them feel safe during the experience. It is very early, but so far the demand has been highest for our large appliances and home theater categories. We are also back in customers' homes, providing valuable services like large product delivery, installations, and in-home repairs in approximately 80% of US ZIP codes. We are doing this in a new and innovative way, using safety guidelines before, during, and after an in-home visit that meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The key of course, is that we are providing options that let customers choose what works best for them. For the foreseeable future, we will likely employ a variety of models using our local level prowess to customize operations to the local situation. And we will continually evolve those operating models based on guidance from state and local governments as well as our own point of view on the proliferation of the virus and our ability to operate in a way that is safe for our employees and customers. I want to take some time to talk about our employees, clearly the Company's most important asset. From the very first days of the pandemic, we told anyone feeling sick or quarantined that they would keep their job and be paid. We told any employee whose child was home from school that they too would be paid. We gave all field employees who are still serving customers or working in our distribution centers, a temporary pay increase and for all others, we paid their normal salaries for a full month as we took the time to determine how to move forward. Throughout this difficult time of uncertainty and fast-paced change, we have been committed to communicating as often as possible with our employees. This includes conducting surveys on their need for flexibility, as well as their feelings on returning to work, so we can continue to improve our processes, facilitate the deliberate and measured return to corporate workspaces, and accommodate those with pre-existing conditions or safety concerns. Likewise, we built the protocols for returning to customers' homes and welcoming them back into our stores jointly with our field employees. We have created a robust feedback group and we connect regularly with other field employees to hear how things are going and solicit immediate feedback to challenges they face iterating the experience as we go. We've also continued our focus on providing crucial employee benefits and resources like those for mental and financial health, recognizing that the circumstances we each face are far more stressful than any of us may fully realize. Like most companies, we have had to make tough decisions including those Matt will touch on regarding the ways in which we have cut costs and preserve liquidity to ensure that at the end of this crisis Best Buy remains a strong, vibrant company. I personally want to touch on the difficult decision to furlough employees. While we were pleased to retain more than 80% of our revenue while our stores were closed to customer traffic, the fact remains that we did this without a single store open to customers. Given this fact, it is clear that the current models we are operating simply don't require the staffing our stores had before this crisis began. In that context, on April 19th, we furloughed approximately 51,000 domestic hourly store employees, including nearly all part time employees, we retained approximately 82% of our full time store and field employees on our payroll, including the vast majority of In-Home Advisors, and Geek Squad agents. Additionally, some corporate employees are participating in voluntary reduced work weeks and resulting pay as well as voluntary furloughs. We have done our best to provide these employees with resources and tools to help them navigate a situation that is undoubtedly new to all of them. In keeping with our view that all of us are in this together, I am foregoing 50% of my base salary and the members of the Board of Directors are forgoing 50% of their cash retainer fees. Company executives reporting directly to me are also taking a 20% reduction in base salary. The money saved from these temporary pay reductions is being added to the employee hardship fund we established with our founder, Dick Schulze. This fund was initially created for our furloughed employees as a way of providing them emergency funds, should they be required. I would now like to provide an update from a strategic lens. Last September, we hosted an investor update meeting to provide additional insights into our strategy. Despite the disruption and uncertainty related to COVID-19, we remain focused on executing our Building the New Blue strategy. In many ways, our current way of life in our homes, reliance on technology has only reinforced our belief in our strategic direction. We firmly believe our strategy will uniquely position us over the long term by leveraging our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. Many of these capabilities and initiatives we laid out on stage in September are the muscles we're flexing right now. Our multiyear supply chain transformation has been focused on moving facilities closer to our customers, and using automation and process improvements, to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed, and improve the delivery and installation experience. This has included significantly improving the buy online, pickup in store experience for our customers. At the same time, we have been innovating and designing digital experiences that solve customer needs across online and physical shopping. As a result, the team was very quickly able to stand up a robust and seamless customer experience for both the curbside pickup process and the new in-store consultation process. All of this culminated in domestic online growth of 155% for the quarter. And during the six weeks we ran our curbside-only model, domestic online sales were up more than 300% compared to last year. Almost 50% of those sales were from customers choosing to pick up their products curbside at our stores. Customer satisfaction scores for the curbside pickup experience remained strong with more than 83% of those surveyed indicating they are extremely likely to recommend Best Buy based on their curbside experience. As it relates to supply chain, let me say first that since the beginning of the pandemic, we've taken a variety of steps to create the safest possible experience for the employees in our distribution centers, while also ensuring that we're still able to deliver to customers with speed. Additionally, the infrastructure and capabilities we have built to thrive during peak holiday periods is serving us well. Even with the sustained online growth levels of approximately 350% during the last three weeks of the quarter, we did not have material disruptions and maintained our levels of fast service. We will continue to invest in all of these capabilities that focus on the customer experience, and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. We will also of course continue to bring our deep CE expertise and unique ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. In fact, in Q1, we saw a significant increase in demand for our expanded assortment of digital health and fitness products, including things such as at-home fitness equipment, and fitness recovery products that truly empower customers to take care of their own health at home. We believe that not only will technology innovation continue, it will accelerate as a result of the pandemic. We believe many of the customer behavior changes resulting from this type of stay-at-home orders will continue to exist moving forward. Best Buy and our vendor partners are rapidly adjusting our offerings to support these new needs in areas like video conferencing, food preparation and storage, and family entertainment. Turning to our in-home consultation service. In mid-March, we pivoted to provide consultations on a digital basis only. We are proud of the nimble way our team quickly transitioned to this alternative way of interacting with customers. And we're pleased with the number of consultations that took place this way. Because of our investments in the technology backbone, our in-home advisors were able to remain productive during this time and continue to provide customers a high level of consultation service. With our Geek Squad, we are in a unique position to help people productively work and learn in their homes. While overall Q1 interactions with our total tech support customers were down compared to last year, as are in-store and in-home services were unavailable, our remote technical support provided a critically stable support solution through these challenging times. In addition, we've cross trained our Geek Squad agents to work in our call centers, providing crucial phone and chat support to solve a variety of customer needs. We also utilized our Geek Squad agents to support our online customer experience by making same-day deliveries to customers' homes from 200 of our stores. As we moved back into homes and welcome customers back into our stores, demand for our services has been very high. Turning to Best Buy Health, our focus on health, in particular helping seniors live more independently with our unique combination of tech and touch has become even more relevant as the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, to support our base of over 1 million seniors, we moved quickly to adapt our operations to our caring center agents to support more than 150,000 calls each week while complying with stay-at-home orders. The time spent by our agents on the phone with our customers was above the normal average at over nine minutes per call in many weeks, as we took the time to ensure we are answering questions and addressing requests to our fullest ability. Our service during this period averaged an NPS of 80. And we are incredibly proud of our caring center agents and the empathy with which they serve this vulnerable population, especially during this time. We also have the opportunity to help our commercial partners manage through this time with the help of technology. A recent example is holiday retirement, a leading senior living community where 29,000 residents have been outfitted with our lively mobile personal emergency response or PERS devices. These devices provide access to our emergency response service at the press of a button. We work with Holiday to leverage these devices to efficiently broadcast timely information and protocols related to COVID shelter-in-place to the senior residents. Lastly, we continue to build out our capabilities as we execute our long-term health strategy. Data is an essential currency of this strategy and we recently entered into an important partnership on that front. Validic is an industry-leading technology platform that aggregates data from everyday connected devices in the home, processes it and then provides meaningful insights. Together with Validic, we are bringing to market innovative remote monitoring solutions to better manage chronic health conditions in the home. In conclusion, we entered the year with financial and strategic momentum and a strong balance sheet. We have a suite of assets that allow us to uniquely and safely serve our customers in whatever way they choose, whether that's curbside pickup, free next day shipping, remote technical advice and support, virtual consultations, in-store appointments, in-home installations or doorstep delivery. We know customers and employees will have different shopping expectations anchored in safe environments and processes. We hope to set the standard for safe retailing by constantly adapting our model, leveraging and building on our unique suite of assets. The environment continues to evolve. And while there are many models and a great deal of speculation, there is still a high level of uncertainty at both the micro and macro levels. With that said, we are scenario planning in a way that addresses a number of variables. First, meaningful unemployment will almost certainly be with us through the fiscal year, not necessarily at the level we are seeing now, but enough to likely have a downward macroeconomic effect. Second, it will be important for us and any retailer to have a flexible enough operating model to accommodate the possibility that some states will continue to relax restrictions, while others at the same time may find themselves needing to tighten similar restrictions on how consumers engage with each other and local businesses. Finally, we will continue to prioritize customer and employee safety, advocating for preventative measures, such as social distancing and masks for both customers and employees. It is our belief that these measures will continue into the foreseeable future and will allow us to do what we promise at the very beginning of this crisis. Be there for our customers in as many ways as possible, while ensuring customers and our employees remain as safe as possible. As challenging as the current situation is, I am certain Best Buy will remain a strong vibrant company that is well positioned to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and different environments. In fact, we have taken the opportunity to move faster as this environment accelerates changes in the ways customers want to interact with retailers. For example, we were already preparing to roll out curbside service, store consultations and certified cross training of employees. As such, the implementation of these capabilities is not just a response to the pandemic, they are in fact an acceleration of our existing strategy. Lastly, and very importantly, I want to take this moment to thank the thousands of employees that have made this all possible. They have faced immense change with grit, determination and compassion, and have helped us shape our approach to safe retailing. Many are working with customers every day, some of whom are also scared, frustrated and occasionally hostile in this COVID environment, to ensure they have access to the products and services they need to work, learn, entertain and connect from home. Others are working tirelessly to maintain the supply chain that delivers with speed and keeps our customers at home. And so, many employees are making technical and operational changes every hour from their home office. None of this is possible without their dedication, and I am truly grateful and feel lucky to be on the team with them. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q1 financial results. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. So, I'll try to give a little color on both TTS and IHA. So, we talked about it a bit in the script. We did definitely see some usage, but the majority of it was remote or via chats and call, because obviously you couldn't come into the stores and we couldn't go into your homes. And so, not only were we constrained by a bit of what you're talking about, Karen, which is you can only put so much to your home office together, we were also just constrained by the way we were operating. And I think we've talked about this before, this severe of a channel shift makes service sales harder than when we have our stores open and when we have a chance to provide that service. We are definitely seeing pent-up demand as we start to open up our stores to the appointment model. Many of the appointments being made are people who want to come in and bring, especially as you can imagine home office or phone products in for us to help take care of them. And we can also see as we're going back into people's homes where the demand and request for us to come to their homes to fix things like refrigerators, laundry, that has been very high. And so, I think there is definitely pent-up demand there as we're heading into Q2 and the team is finding new ways to serve that. On the IHA side of things, it was very interesting. The team across all of our in-home businesses has been very flexibly trying to serve customers, either digitally, phone, chat, any way that they can. They moved -- IHA moved to digital consultations in mid-March. Our IHAs are also helping with this really heavy volume of inbound sales calls and chats, and they are also helping with the new in-store consultation model. Before you come to the store, we actually have a pre-call. And our In-Home Advisors in some cases are helping with that pre-call because we can really figure out what it is that a customer needs. I will say, if I just were to give a couple data points, in April, we saw our IHA business was actually up. And over 60% of that was coming from chat and digital channel. And that through those channels, those virtual consultations was at a 91 NPS. So, this idea that we can more flexibly use the in-home resources, not just physically in people's homes, but in a more virtual consultative way is really, really interesting and something that I think will be a muscle we can see the flex as we go forward. Yes. I will start with, our stores are absolutely an asset, and they have been an asset throughout this. And I'll just use a data point in April, 65% of what we sold online, which is the vast majority of what we sold, was either pickup curbside or shipped from a store. And so, this asset of the store base is very real. Now, you can imagine what we're discerning is how might the stores look and work differently in the future? And how might they provide a variety of fulfillment options, a variety of service and high touch consultative options, like this opens a lot of doors for how your stores might work differently. And that's where our focus is at this point. Thank you. I'll start. And then, maybe Matt can add more color because I'm sure I'll miss something. I think there's a lot that's going on there. So, curbside, even if you look at the original retention we announced at the beginning of curbside, which is around 70%, you can tell that accelerate because by the end of the quarter, we were already at 81%. And so, just I think the performance overarching, we have curbside, the teams were amazingly creative and thoughtful about how they implemented that and definitely got better and better and better at providing that service. We also were very clear that stimulus dollars that started to flow towards the end of the quarter were absolutely helpful. And those lines strongly believe are carrying in Q2 here. It's not all the checks have yet been distributed, although the vast majority now of that money is out there. But we definitely see those stimulus starts buoying the level of demand. And then, I think people continue to have more needs as they spend more and more time in their homes. The initial demand will be definitely around working and learning from home. And this new appointment model, what we're starting to see is there is also demand for cooking. And importantly, I think we all feel it, entertaining at home and creating new and different entertaining theaters, kind of what we've seen in gaming. And so, I think there is also that once you layer on a little bit of a point [Technical Difficulty], you also start to see the demand for some of the other aspects of what it means to be sheltering in place time. Matt, I don't know if you anything to add? Yes. I think that's a really good point I would just lift up. Our teams have done an amazing job on awareness to how to shop. If you go to our website, we have literally a whole site that just walks through all the different ways in which you can interact with Best Buy, and then what's applicable depending on your geography. And you can imagine that's going to take some time for our customers to understand and actually have awareness of all the different ways they can shop Best Buy. The only thing that I would add is to build on Karen Short's question just a little bit. I think the complex, full home office and learning solutions will also continue. I think, people have been piecing together kind of what they can to make it work, as I believe work from home becomes a more sustainable practice. I think, these more fulsome approaches to home office will be really important. I think, Mike's gaming example is the perfect one, meaning that's not pull forward demand. That's demand that would not have existed. People would not have bought those gaming consoles. They would have waited for the next generation of consoles to come in December. But because you're in this unique life situation, there's real incremental demand there. And I think that's the perfect example of what we're seeing. I'll start and Mike can pile on. I don't -- we really for the most part have not. Now, back to what Mike said about the need around your home office or the need around learning, when you're purchasing in that very kind of needs-based way, it's less about trying to trade down, it's more about trying to figure out what exactly is going to fulfill the need for you in your home. That's actually we're seeing in cooking and preparing food at home, we're seeing it in learning in office at home. And so, I think for us, we're actually right now seeing the demand is across the profile of what we sell, and in fact, in some spaces even higher in some of the higher end computing. I think, one of the things that's selling really well in computing is high computing, that's gaming computing. In gaming computing, is actually some of the highest end products that we sell. And you can definitely see that people as they get bored in their home are looking for some ways to entertain themselves and have not been looking for the cheapest way to do that. We said it on the call, our investment in digital and supply chain automation technologies are a huge part of what allowed us to first move to curbside and then set up appointment based scheduling. Both of those required heavy digital builds behind the scenes in order to make an app as an example ready for a customer to make an appointment or for an employee to be able to see who's in the queue waiting for an appointment. And we believe continued investment in those experiences that are going to deliver choice to customers and continue to deliver with speed are absolutely crucial to maintaining our positioning as the year goes on here. No, they're not weaker stories. These are literally for the most part it's us looking at kind of spread of the virus and our available employee population. In a lot of cases, they are actually some of the bigger stores, on the East Coast you can imagine are some that we've either closed or in a couple of situations we still have some government mandates. But don't take those 40 as they're underperforming. These are literally 40 that just it makes a lot of sense based on health, safety and government regulations. Thank you. I'm going to start by building on where Mike had left off, on the consumer side of health. And I'm going to think about this writ large, everything from kind of health and fitness, all the way to taking your temperature and blood pressure cuffs. There is significant demand for technology that will help us maintain and monitor our health at home. And we have seen that across the board. And this is just hypothesis. But my personal hypothesis would be back to the point we were talking about earlier, the level of innovation in health at home is only going to accelerate from here. Not just because people want it but also because what you've seen is a change in reimbursement for telehealth at the overarching kind of government level. And so, that combination of things is incredibly powerful on the consumer side. Now, of course, it's a little tricky there as it relates to specifically our GreatCall devices, the phones, the wearable devices, much of those sales go through our stores. And so, without our stores physically being open, it's little harder to transact that online. So, but in the moment pressure we're feeling is a little bit around our stores not being open. But the potential for devices that are going to keep us connected to our -- especially elderly loved ones right now and also just keep us connected is incredibly high. We hit a little bit on the commercial side in the script. You can imagine there's a great deal of interest around how at a much broader scale we can monitor people's health and take care of them in their homes. If this pandemic has highlighted anything, it is keeping people at home as long as possible, but it's also tracking their vitals, tracking how they're feeling is incredibly important. So, the potential on commercial I think has come to light even faster. And this was our hypothesis that more people would need to have more care in their homes on the back of technology. And I think this has accelerated that hypothesis meaningfully. Thank you so much. And with that, I think that ends our call for today. Thank you all so much for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our progress again next quarter."

Again, thank you so much for joining us. We are looking forward to a great meeting. And now, I could not be more excited to turn the meeting over to Corie Barry, CEO of Best Buy.\nCorie Barry: Thank you so much, Mollie. Good morning, everyone. We are so pleased you could join us today as we report our fiscal \u201822 results and take this opportunity to update our longer-term strategy and our multiyear financial outlook. Today, we will discuss how our business has evolved and how we are planning to drive value over the next few years. We\u2019re not planning to cover all our initiatives or all our business units. We\u2019ve tried to be as succinct as possible to focus on the topics and initiatives that we believe are most important for you to understand about our business, our plans and where we believe we\u2019re headed, both for fiscal \u201823 and for the longer term. First, let\u2019s discuss our fiscal \u201822 results. Fiscal \u201822 was another record year. In addition to record revenue and earnings, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things in the face of unprecedented challenge and change to support our customers\u2019 technology needs in knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. As we discussed when we entered the year, we anchored on three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that were and are shaping our strategic priorities and investments. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while still providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is a need and is playing an even more crucial role in people\u2019s lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. With these concepts in mind, we piloted numerous store formats to test and learn in the past year. We advanced our flexible workforce initiatives and invested in our employees\u2019 well-being. We introduced new technology tools designed to support both, our customers and also our employees. And we also launched a bold new membership program called Best Buy Totaltech designed to significantly elevate our customer experience and drive incremental sales. We will be talking more about all these topics today. All of this was against a constantly evolving backdrop. During the year, we navigated supply chain and transportation challenges, uncertainty as virus peaks rolled across the country, and then most recently, the disruption from the Omicron wave. Our teams did an amazing job against that backdrop, expertly managing supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic to bring in products our customers needed. During the year, we continued serving our customers digitally at much higher rates. Our online revenue was 34% of our domestic revenue. And while it declined versus last year, it was up 115% or $8.8 billion compared to two years ago. At the same time, we also reached our fastest package delivery speeds ever. We are an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. In fact, the percent of online orders we delivered in one day was twice as high as pre-pandemic levels, despite the significant increase in volume during that same timeframe. These record results are driven by the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology, many of which we discussed at our investor updates, both in 2017 and 2019. More importantly, these results are driven by our amazing associates across the Company. Over the past 24 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for our customers, and they worked tirelessly to provide excellent service. In fact, despite all the changes we went through in the last year, we delivered NPS improvements, both online and in our stores. I\u2019m truly grateful for and continue to be impressed by our associates\u2019 dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. From a financial perspective, we delivered record revenue and earnings per share. Our comparable sales growth was 10.4% on top of a very strong 9.7% last year, growing $8 billion over the past two years. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was just over $10, up 27% compared to last year. And compared to two years ago, we expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 110 basis points. Our non-GAAP return on investment improved 840 basis points compared to two years ago, and we drove more than $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the last two years. In fiscal \u201822, we returned $4.2 billion of that to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to deepen our commitment to the community and the environment. Many of you may have had the opportunity to view the video that was playing before the event started. We continue to believe that our ESG efforts are directly tied to long-term value creation, and I am proud of all our initiatives, but we only have time for me to cover a few examples today. We committed to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase by BIPOC representation in the tech industry. We also committed to opening 100 Teen Tech Centers by fiscal \u201825. During fiscal \u201822, we opened 9 to end the year with a total of 44. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. In addition, we\u2019re building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. In terms of the environment, in fiscal \u201822, we were a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative, committing to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. We are also driving sustainability through the unique consumer electronics circular economy. We help keep devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek Squad repair services, responsible recycling and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth, and we are honored to be recognized for our work. Notably, we are placed in the top 5 on Barron\u2019s Most Sustainable Companies list for the past five years in a row. This ranking recognizes our strong performance across all aspects of ESG. In addition, we are on the CDP Climate A List for the fifth year, which recognizes leadership in making a positive impact on the environment. Now, let\u2019s move on to our Q4 results. I am extremely proud of what we accomplished during the fourth quarter. Our team showed remarkable execution and dedication to serving our customers throughout the important gift-giving season. This was evidenced by the fact that we drove improvement in year-over-year customer NPS metrics across almost all areas, particularly for in-store, online and chat experiences. In fact, we saw our best-ever customer satisfaction scores for our in-store pickup experience. Online sales were almost 40% of domestic revenue compared to 43% last year and 25% in Q4 of fiscal \u201820. We reached our fastest holiday delivery times ever, shipping products to customer homes more than 25% faster than last year and two years ago. We also completed the purchase of two companies that aligned with our strategy, which Jason and Deborah will talk about later this morning. We are deliberately investing in our future and furthering our competitive differentiation. This, as we expected, is temporarily impacting our profitability. The biggest areas of investment in Q4 were our new membership program, technology and Best Buy Health, all core to our future growth potential. In the face of unexpected change, I remain inspired by the way our teams across the enterprise remain flexible to ensure our customers were able to find the perfect gift. We remain well-positioned as we head into fiscal \u201823 as the unique technology provider for the home. I\u2019ll turn the meeting over to Matt to cover more details on our Q4 results and fiscal \u201823 outlook. Matt?\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you, Corie, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were all able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Our Q4 revenue was $16.4 billion. Our domestic comparable sales declined 2.1%, and our enterprise comp sales declined 2.3%. Revenue grew 8% versus two years ago. It was only slightly below the low end of our revenue guidance for the quarter due to a few factors. The first factor was inventory availability. We expected to have pockets of inventory constraints as we entered the quarter and called out a few areas, including appliances, gaming and mobile phones. As the quarter progressed, inventory was more constrained than we anticipated within a few categories and brands. These constraints included some high-demand holiday items, and the categories most impacted were mobile phones and computing. The second factor impacting our results was Omicron. The Omicron wave and the resulting high levels of employee callouts led to a temporary reduction in our store hours in January and to start fiscal \u201823. In mid-February, our staffing level started to improve and we increased store operating hours for the majority of our stores. Excluding these two factors, our revenue would have been comfortably in the guidance range we provided for the quarter. From a category standpoint, on a weighted basis the top areas with positive comparable sales growth included appliances, virtual reality, home theater and headphones. We saw comparable sales declines in gaming, mobile phones, tablets and services. Turning now to gross profit. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points to 20.2%. This was about 20 basis points lower than we expected, primarily due to increased proportionality. When comparing to last year, the largest driver was our services category, primarily driven by Totaltech. Our product margins were largely flat to last year, as the benefit from category sales mix was offset by increased promotions. Higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement was a benefit to gross profit rate compared to last year. Lastly, our international gross profit rate improved 210 basis points to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our enterprise results. Our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 5% versus last year, less than our guide of 8% growth, primarily due to lower than anticipated incentive compensation. Within our domestic segment, our SG&A dollars increased $139 million. The largest drivers were, one, advertising, which included campaigns for both, holiday and to drive awareness for our new membership offering; two, technology; three, increased store and call center labor that helped drive the record customer satisfaction scores Corie shared; and four, Best Buy Health, which includes the impact associated with our acquisition. Before I discuss the \u201823 financial outlook, let me spend some time on our new Totaltech membership program. Corie will provide a more holistic overview later in her presentation, but I will add some color on the impacts to our Q4 results and for next year. Totaltech is a near-term investment to dive long-term value. The thesis is that over time, we will capture incremental product sales from our members that will lead to higher operating income. But, as we discussed in prior earnings calls, it does come with near-term profitability impacts. First, at $199, the standalone membership is profitable. It just isn\u2019t as profitable as legacy service memberships, due to the breadth of benefits and the cost to fulfill them. Second, there is a loss of revenue and profit from existing revenue streams that are now included as benefits in the program. For example, previously standalone services like extended warranties and products installations are now included within our Totaltech membership. We still offer these services on a standalone basis or to nonmembers. But, you can imagine there\u2019s an aspect of cannibalization as members are no longer paying incrementally for these items. So, what does all this mean? We expect that the gross profit rate of our services category will reset to a new level going forward that is lower than it was prior to launching Totaltech. The way to drive more operating income, despite this lower services gross profit rate, is to add far more members than we thought was possible under our previous membership offerings. The key to increased profit will be through increased volume through a combination of more recurring membership revenue and incremental product purchases of our members. The number of memberships grew very nicely in Q4, and our plans for fiscal \u201823 assume continued growth, but it\u2019ll take some time to reach the scale necessary to offset the lower gross profit rate I just described. Therefore, Totaltech remains a pressure in fiscal \u201823, but we expect it to be a meaningful driver of both, higher sales and operating income dollars in fiscal \u201825 targets. Now, let\u2019s talk about our overall fiscal \u201823 outlook. Our guide is anchored around a comparable sales decline in the range of 1% to 4% and a 5.4% non-GAAP operating income rate. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook is $8.85 to $9.15. Before we discuss the broader assumptions driving our guide, I want to touch on our expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is planned at a more normalized level of 24.5% in fiscal \u201823 compared to 19% rate in fiscal \u201822. As you may recall, our Q2 results this past year included a $0.47 diluted EPS benefit from the resolution of certain discrete matters. Now, I\u2019d like to share a few important assumptions underpinning our guidance. First, we anticipate the traditional CE industry to decline in the low- to mid-single digits next year as we lap the high levels of growth and stimulus actions from this past year. In addition, we anticipate the number of store closures to be in the range of 20 to 30, which is consistent with the trend over the past five years. As I mentioned, our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.4% compared to 6% in fiscal \u201822. To be clear, the biggest driver of the lower operating income rate in fiscal \u201823 is our investment in Totaltech. As I just described, this near-term pressure will drive long-term value for our shareholders. There are of course, other factors that we expect to impact our results that for the most part offset each other in fiscal \u201823. We do expect higher levels of promotional activity to pressure our gross profit rate, which is partially offset by the favorable impact of expected growth and our monetization of our advertising business, or Best Buy Ads. We expect our full year SG&A expense to be lower than fiscal \u201822 levels. The largest year-over-year variance is lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our plans after paying out at higher levels in fiscal \u201822 due to the overachieving of our performance targets. We expect the lower incentive comp to be partially offset by a few areas. The first area is higher technology cost, primarily due to annualizing spend in fiscal \u201822; the second area is higher depreciation and store remodel expense, as Damien will discuss later; and lastly, we expect to see higher SG&A dollars in support of our Best Buy Ads business. Finally, as you may have noticed, we are not providing quarterly guidance, but I would like to provide some insight on the assumed phasing for fiscal \u201823. Due to the strong first half comps last year, we expect our full year comparable sales decline to be weighted more heavily in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect to see significantly more year-over-year operating income rate pressure in the first half of the year compared to the back half. To summarize, the two largest variables for fiscal \u201823 financial results are the short-term industry declines as we lap high growth in government stimulus and the investment in our new membership program that will drive long-term value. As we look to fiscal \u201825, we expect the CE industry will return to the high levels we saw in fiscal \u201822 and that Totaltech will drive meaningful growth. I will now turn the meeting back over to Corie to begin our strategic update.\nCorie Barry: Thank you so much, Matt. As I noted closing out my Q4 summary, we remain well-positioned as we head into fiscal \u201823. I\u2019d like to expand on this a bit as we highlight our strategic positioning. There are three key points you should take away from this morning. First, technology is a necessity, and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. Second, we have built an ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences no one else can. And third, we believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time. We believe we have the right strategy to deliver growth and value for all stakeholders. And we are excited to go into more detail about our plans. But first, let\u2019s do some level setting. Our purpose is unchanged and more relevant today this minute than ever. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is enduring, and we have honed our five-year vision. We personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. Technology is no longer a nice to have, it is a necessity, and it is expanding into all parts of our lives and homes. Working has forever changed. Streaming content has exponentially grown. The metaverse is coming to life. We can power our homes with connected solar panels. Cars are connected. And we can monitor our health, including connecting with the physician from our living room. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology. And we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers\u2019 homes right for their lives. For example, we will send a consultant to your home for free to optimize the tech you have or have the tech you want. We can repair your phone screen and you can try VR headsets while you wait. You can meet with a fitness consultant in our virtual store, who will match your fitness goals with our fitness products, or you can use our Lively device to connect with a carrying center agent, who can help you schedule a lift. These are just some examples, and you\u2019ll see this come to life in many more ways throughout our presentation this morning. From a financial perspective, we delivered remarkable results over the past two years, and we are far ahead of where we expected to be when we set our long-term financial targets back in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, in the past two years, we have delivered more than $8 billion of revenue growth and improved our operating income rate by 110 basis points to 6%. We are in a strong position to drive the business forward and deliver growth. We do not, for one minute, believe we hit our peak revenue and margin this past year. As Matt outlined, we do expect fiscal \u201823 to look different as the industry cycles the last two years of unusually strong demand. And we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. But in fiscal \u201825, we expect to deliver revenue growth and expand our operating income rate beyond what we reported in fiscal \u201822. As we have always said, in order to deliver these financial results, it is paramount that we stay focused on our goal to remain a best place to work and we continue to deepen relationships with our customers. As you can see, our new fiscal \u201825 targets are materially higher than what we thought just back in 2019. We now expect to generate approximately $1 billion more in operating income than our original targets. Given our margin rate, this is considerable growth in operating income. So, what\u2019s changed since 2019? Well, the CE industry is larger than we expected. Our online mix has nearly doubled. We have found ways to make our operating model more flexible and efficient while also investing in wages and benefits. We are accelerating our category expansion. And we have launched an entirely new membership program. On the flip side, the financial contribution from Best Buy Health is clearer, but also a bit longer term than we had originally modeled. This is based on primarily two things. First, demand in active aging business and product constraints were impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, based on our internal learnings and insights from consumer behavior changes over the past two years, we tuned our strategy to focus on the growing virtual care opportunity, which Deborah will discuss in more detail later. As we think about our strategy going forward, it is important to look at how dramatically our business has evolved over the past several years. Here, we use fiscal \u201815 to give a longer-term view to what a different business we have become. Most of these changes were already in motion before the pandemic and then accelerated significantly in the past two years. Let me expand on a few points here. I already mentioned our fiscal \u201822 online business was 34% of our domestic sales. That is more than $16 billion in sales compared to just $3.5 billion in fiscal \u201815. When you look at how we use our stores for fulfillment, the increase in the sheer number of products customers are picking up in our stores is impressive. This is even more meaningful, when you consider the fact that our delivery speed is industry-leading, and we cut the delivery speed essentially in half over the past several years. Clearly, customers value our stores and the convenience and choice they provide. As Damien is going to discuss, we are increasingly interacting with customers via digital channels, like chat and video and in their homes. And finally, membership is incredibly important, both now and into our future. Our Totaltech membership is a big theme of today\u2019s presentation. But don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we were a pioneer in loyalty programs. And our My Best Buy program now has more than 100 million total members. So, with all of that as background, I\u2019d like to tap back to our first key takeaway. Technology is a necessity, and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. So, let\u2019s start with some industry context. The traditional CE industry is large and growing. There is no perfect external source that tracks our business. So here, we\u2019re showing a historical view based on selected government PCE category data. Our outlook is based on multiple industry forecasts and internal data. As you can see on this chart, the industry was growing for several years and then accelerated during the last two years. As Matt mentioned, we expect it to step back this year as the industry absorbs the very high growth of the past two years. By fiscal \u201825, we believe it can be back to fiscal \u201822 levels, which is materially higher than it was pre pandemic. In addition, we\u2019re expanding our addressable market by entering new categories in areas like health and electric bikes that are being disrupted by technology in a good way as well as areas where we can really complete solutions for customers, like indoor and outdoor living. Jason will provide a bit more detail on these in a few minutes. As a reminder, this is also a stable industry. Contrary to some sentiment, technology is no more volatile or cyclical than other large durable goods categories over time. And the last two years have significantly underscored the importance of technology in day-to-day life. What historically was seen as a want has become a need. 40% of Americans use digital technology or the Internet in new or different ways compared with before the pandemic. And the use of telemedicine is triple what it was in just Q1 of 2020. The majority of people who started or increased activities like online fitness, telemedicine, videoconferencing and connecting socially with others virtually say they plan to continue this increased usage even after the pandemic. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before, and they\u2019re also more tech connected than they ever have been before. As a result, there is an overall larger installed base of consumers using technology. People own more tech devices than ever before. This combination of more devices and more activities also means customers need their tech to work seamlessly every day. True tech support when the customer wants it underpins living this way and is our unique asset across all these devices. And technology is extending in all aspects of our home, and we\u2019ve all grown to depend on it. This is not a hit-driven category. It is an industry that is need-based, stable and has been growing. We firmly believe people will continue to use technology more and both need and want to replace or upgrade their products. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world\u2019s largest companies and likely some we haven\u2019t even heard of yet, means innovation is constant. And that innovation drives interest, upgrades and experimentation into the future. This is not a static industry. So, to talk about this exciting world of technology innovation, I\u2019m honored to welcome Jason Bonfig, our Chief Merchandising Officer.\nJason Bonfig: Thanks, Corie. Good morning. We continue to lead the tech industry with significant high-share and high-consideration categories. What I mean by a high-consideration category, generally higher ASPs in a longer period of time from when you start to think about purchasing to when you actually purchase. Continuing to grow our share in these large categories like televisions and computing will always be a cornerstone of our strategy. But to be truly there for our customers and all their technology needs, we need to accelerate our share across other areas of technology as well and also some new spaces. This is where Totaltech comes in. Products with lower ASPs and shorter upgrade and consideration cycles, our share is generally lower. Totaltech creates a new value proposition that benefits customers when they consolidate their technology shopping at Best Buy. I want to give three examples of a customer journey that illustrate this point. Let\u2019s start with a customer that actually wants to upgrade their kitchen. They want to buy an entirely new kitchen suite with three pieces. That customer that has Totaltech does not have to worry about delivery and install. It\u2019s included in the price. That could be between $400 and $500 value. A little bit later in the year, the same customer hypothetically breaks their phone. They want to get a new iPhone. When they purchase that iPhone at Best Buy, AppleCare is included. Just in the first year, that\u2019s just under $120 of value. Then a little bit later in the year, they want to get a new pair of wireless headphones. If you purchase those headphones at Best Buy, the warranty is also included and you\u2019re a Totaltech member. That\u2019s a $30 value. Examples like these is where Totaltech benefits come to life for our customers and create a reason to make a considered visit to our app, our website, our store, and increases Best Buy share across all of the categories on the slide behind me. Technology innovation never stops. And even when you look over the past three years, you can see value of the new technology and what it creates for our customers. During the pandemic, the majority of the focus was around creating products to meet customer demand. This was a distraction, but even with that, there was significant innovation and value created by our vendors. The slide behind me highlights an upgrade over a three-year period of similar price points across laptops and televisions. While I won\u2019t hit on every new feature and advancement that happened, I\u2019ll highlight a few. For televisions, you get a full 10 inches more in screen size, almost no bezel and the ability to navigate your TV with voice, if you\u2019d like to. On the laptop side, you can log in with your face. It\u2019s faster, thinner, lighter and has significantly longer battery life. These continued evolutionary innovation cycles are never ending, and they drive growth. They create reasons to upgrade and unlock new and better experiences for our customers each and every year. In fact, when we look at our customers\u2019 behavior, we\u2019re seeing a 7% to 15% reduction in the amount of time it takes a customer to get back into a category. They\u2019re coming back to categories faster because of these innovations by our vendors. I\u2019ve highlighted how Totaltech and our vendor innovations will drive growth. Now, I\u2019d like to highlight some macro trends that will also drive opportunities in our business. I\u2019ll start with 5G and fiber. The expansion of speed and networks in general are really, really good for customers and technology. You can download a movie in minutes, collaborate with others instantly, excess a video game or video content anywhere you want without latency. These are things that will drive new experiences and growth for our customers. The next trend is the metaverse and cloud, have virtual experiences, play golf with friends or family members virtually, travel to places that you actually can\u2019t and have a full experience in the virtual world. In addition to that, when you look at the virtual world and cloud, there are new experiences that are created. Previously, you could just play a game on a gaming system and your television. Now you can take that same game seamlessly from the system, to your phone, to your tablet. In fact, if some of you have children like I do, you\u2019re constantly battling the ability for them to play anywhere they want, anytime they want. The cloud also solves significant customer pain points. Previously, our customers would tell us when they wanted to upgrade a computing product, it would take them 60 minutes to get it the exact way they\u2019d want to. That would be moving their icons, their data, just getting it the way the old one was and having the features of the new. Today, with cloud, you\u2019re simply putting your credentials and in 10 to 15 minutes, it\u2019s actually exactly the way you want. You get all the benefits of the new technology and you get all of the placement and all the setup of your old product instantly. That does drive upgrade and it drives interest in customers in upgrading more frequently. The next trend I\u2019d like to talk about is automation and support. The connected home has been around for years, and it\u2019s now moving into automation and support more specifically. Single-function devices like robot vacuums today, tomorrow, they\u2019ll move into security of the entire home, communication and assistance for individuals. This is very, very important as our population ages and people want to stay in their homes longer. Automation and support is one of the ways where technology can enable people to just do that and accomplish their goals and solve that pain point. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about customization and personalization. Customers have always wanted to express themselves, and technology is not excluded from that. But there has been significant advancement in manufacturing from appliances to cell phones where customers can express themselves with a touch of color, a family photo or any other type of personal expression that they\u2019d like to integrate into the products. Sustainability is also a significant trend that\u2019s important to customers, but also very important to Best Buy. I\u2019ll start with a vendor example. Samsung televisions that we sell in our stores today have what is called Samsung solar cell technology in their remote controls. This eliminates the need for batteries, which is obviously very beneficial to the environment, but it also charges off of not only solar, but ambient light in the home. And it means that you\u2019re never going to have a remote that\u2019s out of power. That solves a significant customer pain point. Technology like this will expand to more and more categories and drive upgrade cycles. In addition to that, we want to make sure that we\u2019re supporting customers that want to upgrade more frequently. Today, you see that come to life with our recycling and trade-in programs, which are a very important part of our value proposition to customers. Over time, that will start to move into new usage models that may actually be upfront conversations about exactly how long a customer wants to use a product, and when that next upgrade will happen? Will it be a year? Will it be two years, or will it be three years as we move forward? Let\u2019s watch the video highlighting many of the areas I\u2019ve talked about and even some new additional areas that will drive growth. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nJason Bonfig: I\u2019d like to thank our friends at Samsung for that assist in that demo. As we look over the past decade, we\u2019ve had over $12 billion in sales growth with the vast majority coming from large categories like TVs, computing and appliances, and one-third coming from new categories like wearables and VR, just to name a few. As we move forward, that innovation will continue and there will continue to be new categories that don\u2019t even exist today. We\u2019re also looking to accelerate that expansion by entering new categories that are aligned with where our customers want us to be in places where Best Buy can solve real customer pain points. For the next 12 to 24 months, we\u2019ll continue to focus on these five areas of expansion. I\u2019ll go a bit deeper on three of these: fitness and wellness, outdoor living and personal electric transportation, in the next few minutes. I\u2019ll start with fitness and wellness. This is a $34 billion industry that we are uniquely positioned to compete in with our blue shirts, but also our large product fulfillment network that was built for televisions and appliances. Our assortment has grown by 650% in the last 12 months, and we are implementing a larger, more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months with dedicated zones for vendors. Damien will touch on the virtual store a little bit later, but customers today actually have the ability to have a virtual chat or video consultation with a fitness expert. The next area I\u2019d like to talk about is personal electric transportation. This is a $3 billion industry with rapid growth. We\u2019ve introduced 250 new products this holiday with 500 additional accessories around those products. We\u2019ll be adding physical assortment to 900 stores and a more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months. We currently offer assembly, and we\u2019re in the pilot stages of service and support and repair for our customers. The last category I\u2019d like to highlight is outdoor living. This is over a $30 billion industry, and our acquisition of Yardbird, a leading premium outdoor furniture company, provides the ability for us to accelerate this business across a nationwide network. That acquisition, combined with our strength in outdoor television and audio, and new partnerships with leading brands like Traeger, Weber and Bromic, create a comprehensive solution for our customers. When we couple that assortment with our home consultants, and the physical and digital experiences that we\u2019ve developed for customers, this is a really, really fast-moving category that has the ability to grow. You\u2019ll start to see Yardbird products as fast as this spring in Southern California market, and we\u2019re very excited about that. To reiterate, we expect growth from Totaltech, consistent innovation from our vendors, macro trends that I\u2019ve mentioned, new product categories that we don\u2019t even know about yet and five new areas of expansion to move our business forward. Thank you. I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Corie.\nCorie Barry: Thanks so much, Jason. Obviously, you are the expert. Back to our second key takeaway. We have built a unique ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences that no one else can. Consumer electronics is a distinctive industry. The products are constantly evolving. They\u2019re connected to networks that are constantly evolving. They all use different operating systems, and they range from small and powerful to large and breakable, often at high price points. And customers are more comfortable using tech than they have ever been yet. They also admit it\u2019s likely not doing all it could to make their lives better. Against that backdrop, we have built a unique ecosystem of assets that all work together to create a stickier and more valuable relationship with the customer. And we\u2019re investing in this ecosystem as we pivot against a backdrop of even higher customer expectations. We\u2019ll provide more depth on a number of these assets through the rest of the presentation. So, anchoring this ecosystem is our expert advice and service. Customers are excited about tech and want to be confident in their purchase. We provide that in ways literally no one else can, from our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn\u2019t working the way you want or trade in the recycling when you want to upgrade. And then building on that strength, our Totaltech membership ties these experiences together and provides unique benefits that customers value and no one else can provide. We then combine those unique experiences with our strength in omnichannel retailing, industry-leading and seamless shopping experiences and services across all channels, including in-home, in-store, digitally, remotely and virtually. And finally, all these interactions provide us rich data and insights across customer experiences to create personalized technology solution tailored to the customer-specific technology and needs. And all this data fuels our business, like Best Buy Ads, matching our partners\u2019 marketing to the most appropriate audiences based on our first-party data. When this ecosystem works together, it provides a unique experience tailored to the customer. It also reaches beyond our consumers into business partners, suppliers and other strategic relationships that leverage our capabilities. Whether it\u2019s our consultative services highlighted on partners\u2019 websites or vendors leveraging our in-store pickup to fulfill from their websites, others value our capabilities. So, let me add some color around the first part of the ecosystem. As I said, customers are excited about tech and want to be confident with their purchase, particularly when it\u2019s part of their daily life at home. So, instead of me trying to describe all the parts and pieces to you, I think this video does an excellent job bringing to life the unique ways we provide expert advice and services, seamlessly across all our touch points. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nCorie Barry: So again, just to reinforce, there is no one else that can provide this type of immersive experience at scale in a world where more and more of our lives are being lived in a way that requires technology. And we felt it was important to double down on our unique capabilities with an equally unique membership offer. This represents literally years of customer research and innovation and truly puts the customer at the center of our investments. Matt talked earlier about the financial implications of our new membership program. Now, I get to talk about the fun part. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. Matt and Jason already mentioned some of the benefits. But as a reminder, Totaltech includes product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, extended warranties on products and much more. Because the membership is so comprehensive, it has broad appeal among our customers. There is truly something for everyone. And the benefit that\u2019s most appealing can vary based on a customer\u2019s unique shopping journey or their stage in life. So, let me share some early examples. I say early because as a reminder, we literally just rolled this program nationally in mid-October. The benefits associated with purchasing products like product warranty and member pricing are being leveraged the most. Younger generations are using these benefits, especially AppleCare at a higher rate than older generations. This is exciting and important, as extended warranties as a stand-alone business was definitely not a growing part of our business or strategy. And additionally, it\u2019s exciting that our employees have embraced this offer, realizing the suite of benefits means there is something in it for every customer. This makes for a more comfortable and natural sales environment and allows the employees to truly focus on the customers\u2019 needs. The VIP access to phone and chat support and access to Geek Squad support and services in general are used more often by older generations, which are legacy plans over-indexed on. And the access to hard-to-get inventory is resonating with some of our most engaged customers who already interact and spend with us very frequently. That broad appeal is one of the main reasons we rolled out this program. We have significantly elevated the customer experience by packaging up unique benefits our customers value that no one else can provide. And by doing so, we believe we have made it inconceivable for them to purchase their tech anywhere else. From a business perspective, of course, the goal is to increase customer frequency and capture a larger share of CE spend. As a specialty retailer, our customer frequency has a different profile than mass merchants. As a result, it is even more crucial that we stay in the consideration set as customers are building out their technology solutions. I am incredibly happy to say that we are indeed seeing increased interactions with our Totaltech customers to the tune of about 60%. Also, when we look at NPS surveys, specifically from customers who are Totaltech members, they are running about 1,400 basis points higher than nonmembers. From a spend perspective, it\u2019s difficult to calculate with precision, given the early stage of membership and our historical customer frequency. But we currently believe customers who sign up for the membership are spending about 20% more than they would have if they did not have the membership. We already have 4.6 million members. Now to be transparent, we auto converted 3.7 million Totaltech support and other legacy support programs. We have actively enrolled more than 1 million members since launching nationwide in October. And we see a path to double the number of members by the end of fiscal \u201825. This membership program is a vital addition to our customer relationship ecosystem, providing an offer that no one else can and interaction data that is incredibly valuable to all aspects of our business, fueling our growth over time. And to deliver this offer seamlessly, we leverage another part of our ecosystem, omnichannel retailing strength. To provide more depth on the evolution of our omnichannel retailing model, I am pleased to welcome Damien Harmon, our EVP Omnichannel, to the stage to talk to you about how we are optimizing our workforce, reimagining our physical presence and leveraging technology. Damien?\nDamien Harmon: Thank you, Corie. It\u2019s great to be here with you today to talk about our accomplishments and our plans for this year and beyond across our omnichannel portfolio. As Corie mentioned earlier, omnichannel retail is a critical component of our strategic ecosystem. It\u2019s the most direct way to connect our strategy to the needs of our customers and employees. Let\u2019s look at the last two years before we dive into where we\u2019re going. These last two years have challenged our employees in ways we could have never imagined. Powered by our strategic investments, we were able to serve our customers\u2019 needs and grow the business. There are two areas I want to highlight. First, the connection between our online sales, which expanded to 34% of our total domestic revenue and the 150% growth we\u2019ve seen in our virtual interaction across video, chat and voice. Today, 84% of the Best Buy customers use digital channels throughout their shopping journey. These virtual opportunities have created new ways for us to offer customers the immediate ability to shop with an expert wherever they are. Second and also connected to our customers using digital channels throughout their shopping journey is we\u2019ve seen a 72% growth in customers who are using our app while in our stores. This also creates an opportunity for us to build more digital interactions and technology-related solutions to support their needs. These numbers are amazing. We could not be more proud of our teams and how they deliver. Just as importantly, it gives us an incredible foundation for continued growth and optimism as we look to the future. Now from an omnichannel perspective, we look at the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. The two main drivers of that and what I\u2019m going to talk about today are how we optimize our workforce and reimagine our physical presence in ways that serve our customers\u2019 needs in an ever-growing digital world. Our focus is on further developing our teammates to give them the skills to help customers inside and outside of our stores, but more importantly, through any number of digital channels that at our customers\u2019 fingertips. At the same time, we will optimize our store portfolio. And as Matt mentioned, we will maintain the trend of closing 20 to 30 stores per year. However, with online penetration growing so rapidly in the last two years, we\u2019re making investments in our stores to provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as customers move from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home. So, I\u2019ll start with our people. We have significantly improved efficiency and productivity of our store labor model. We\u2019ve seen a more than 100 basis-point improvement in store domestic labor expense as a percentage of revenue compared to FY20. We\u2019ve also materially increased store productivity over the past two years. We\u2019ve done this by reskilling our teammates and making investments that lean into physical and digital shopping experience. A few examples include our fulfillment improvements, consultation labor and our virtual store. This allows us to leverage our employees more effectively inside and outside of our stores. The great news is that as we\u2019ve made these adjustments, we\u2019ve maintained a strong NPS in our stores. These investments in our people have allowed us to help them learn new skills, grow their careers, gain flexibility and realize their dream by keeping them with us longer. We\u2019ve increased our average wage rate 20% in the last two years by raising our minimum wage to $15 an hour and shifting some of our employees into higher skilled, higher paying roles. In fact, our average wage for our field employees this year will be over $18 an hour. Since we started our flexible workforce initiative in 2020, 80% of our talented associates are now skilled to support multiple jobs inside and outside of our stores. And we\u2019re proud of the fact that our fill turnover rates remain significantly below retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates. Overall, we\u2019re in a place we like right now. We\u2019re becoming more efficient without losing sight of delivering amazing experiences for our customers and our employees. We\u2019re going to continue to strike the balance between spend and productivity as we look at the factors that I just outlined. Now, an obvious differentiator for our workforce is our Geek Squad team, which continues to deliver an experience that creates repeat customers. We have nearly 21 million services interactions across in-store and in-home services. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our repair capabilities in categories that are important to customers [Technical Difficulty] helped us produce fantastic NPS results in-store, in-home and through our remote support. And after we complete the repairs, customer spend one times more [Technical Difficulty]. In fact 35% of our mobile phone customers are new or reengaged with Best Buy. This is enabled by a technical workforce that has an average tenure of almost nine years and a retention rate an 86%, no-one can match that level of expertise at the scale we can. That\u2019s huge. That team here has helped us produce fantastic NPS results. In-store, in home, and remote areas, customer spend 1.7 times more and engage 1.6 times more often across all Geek Squad services. Geek Squad will be a viral part of our Totaltech initiative, and we\u2019ll continue to offer standalone services that matter to customers, deepen those relationships and drive frequency. Our customers are also leveraging our expertise through consultations as well, both inside and outside of our stores. These consultations provide a direct access to customers for an ever-growing set of experts. Employees who have the skill sets to complete a consultation has grown by 78% last year. And with each consultation, we can inspire what\u2019s possible. Customers spend 17% more across their lifetime value, and they purchase more often when engaged for a consultation. Customers are loving this experience, and we\u2019re seeing strong NPS. When surveyed, 92% of customers say they will likely continue working our expert. And when customers engage with one of our consultations or designers, they shop with Best Buy 2 times more frequently. So looking ahead, we believe our annual consultations will grow by more than 200% by fiscal \u201825. As you saw earlier, we had 45 million virtual interactions across all channels, creating opportunities to engage our customers differently. We\u2019re excited about our virtual store, which just launched last fall. To date, our virtual store in comparison to historical chat experiences is generating higher close rate, higher sales and a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction. And that\u2019s not all. Our vendors are extremely excited about it as well. We started with 17 vendors on board, and we will end fiscal \u201823 with over 60 vendors investing in our virtual store. This is an investment in us and the belief that we\u2019re creating a totally differentiating experience. We\u2019re expanding our virtual store and adding more categories like appliances and home theater. And we expect our virtual sales interactions to double by fiscal \u201825. So, let\u2019s talk about ways we are reimagining our store in support of our physical and digital shopping experiences. We are very excited about the things that we\u2019re testing, learning, in some cases, implementing in our stores. First, let\u2019s talk about experiential store. In 2020, we launched a test in one of our Houston stores and added two additional locations since then. Some of the key enhancements include dedicated showcase spaces for some of the new categories Jason mentioned earlier, like e-transportation, outdoor living, fitness. We expanded our Microsoft and Apple shops and dedicated more space to premium experiences like appliances, home theater and audio. We expanded our Geek Squad presence for more customer interactions and space for repair services. And we\u2019ve also enhanced the fulfillment capabilities to include exterior lockers, additional space with shipping, packing and fulfilling from our store warehouses. And we\u2019re excited about the performance. We\u2019ve seen a 370 basis-point improvement in NPS. We\u2019ve seen a steady lift in customer penetration in the retail trade area as well as overall customer spend. And we expect to continue to see strong revenue lift in these experiential stores, and we will remodel 50 locations in fiscal \u201823 and about 300 locations expected by fiscal \u201825. Now, I want to highlight our 16 outlet stores that are open-box clearance, end of life and otherwise distressed large product inventory across major appliances and televisions, which might otherwise be liquidated at a significant lower recovery rate. These outlets unlock value by alleviating space and capacity from our core stores, and they are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in the landfill. In FY22, gross liquidation recovery rate is almost 2 times higher than alternative channels. These locations are attracting new and reengaged customers. 16% of customers are new and 37% of customers are reengaged. In FY23, we will double the amount of outlet stores, and we\u2019ll test expanding our assortments by adding computing, gaming and mobile phones. As we discussed last year, we launched a test in Charlotte of a new holistic market approach. And as I mentioned earlier, the ways people are shopping today are entirely different than how they shopped two years ago, and our stores and the way they operate need to change and adjust accordingly. This work in Charlotte is a manifestation of this shopping evolution, and this pilot leverages all of our assets in a full portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlets, consultation labor, and we bring it all together with our digital app. Within the test, we are looking at how a variety of store formats across 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square feet locations can serve customers\u2019 needs. And this summer, we will be introducing a 5,000 square-foot store into the marketplace. When you look at the before and after map of the Charlotte market, you can see we have reduced our overall square footage by 5% and yet we\u2019ve increased our customer coverage in the marketplace from 76% to 85%. We\u2019ve also added 260 access points, where customers can get their gear and employee delivery covers nearly half of the metro. So looking ahead, we\u2019ll be focusing on using this market to learn in fiscal \u201823 before we make decisions on what to scale or what not to. Technology enhancements are at the center of many of the changes I just mentioned, from self-checkout to virtual store, technology supporting our teams and customers in new and exciting ways. Take a look at this video to see what we\u2019re doing. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nDamien Harmon: As we can see, technology brings it all together in support of our optimized workforce and how our physical locations will enhance the shopping experience inside and outside of our stores. We\u2019re excited about this year and our future as we focus on the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our President of Best Buy Health, Deborah Di Sanzo.\nDeborah Di Sanzo: Thank you, Damien. Here is the ecosystem slide Corie and Damien shared, and it\u2019s a perfect introduction to Best Buy Health as our work is an excellent example of the Best Buy ecosystem and flywheel. Today, I will share the strategy of health at Best Buy. But first, let\u2019s see it come to life in this video. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nDeborah Di Sanzo: I hope the video begins to answer the question that I hear often, \u201cWhy in the world is Best Buy in health?\u201d I understand the question because health is complex. It has a longer return on investment, and other companies have not succeeded. So why will Best Buy succeed? We didn\u2019t build this strategy to be like any other company or to change who Best Buy is. We built our strategy on Best Buy strengths, our world-class omnichannel, distribution and logistics, strong analytics, presence in the home and our empathetic caring center agents. Our strategy is supported by the rapid consumerization of health and two significant trends. First, Technology is moving into health. We recognize an $80 billion market opportunity for health technology and the desire for consumers to use technology to manage their health. And second, health is moving into the home. By 2025, an estimated $265 billion in Medicare services will move into the home, and 61% of patients say they would choose hospital care at home. And Best Buy has long proven we\u2019re a trusted advisor for technology in the home. 70% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Best Buy store, able to shop health and wellness products, speak with our expert blue shirts and utilize our distribution hubs to fulfill their health technology needs. Geek Squad makes 9 million home visits annually, helping consumers set up technology and perhaps more importantly, teaching them how to use it. And we have the confidence of our customers and partners as we work to help enhance the health industry. Our strategy is to enable care at home, building on the strengths in three focal areas. In consumer health, we provide curated health and wellness products; in active aging, we offer health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home; in virtual care, we connect patients with their physicians and enable care at home. Our presence in each of these focal areas creates a flywheel where growth in one adds momentum to the other two. This is the strength of our story. Now, let us look at the customer journey. Jason touched on a few areas of consumer health earlier and our video introduced you to Angela, a 45-year-old mother and caregiver to an aging father. You saw her purchase a TytoCare home medical kit when her son was sick. And Angela can find countless other products to support the health of her family from weighted blankets to exercise equipment to blood pressure cuffs and more. These products not only support our customers and their day-to-day health but also serve as an entry to our other two focal areas, active aging and virtual care. Lively supports adults who want to age independently at home. Our easy-to-use phones and personal emergency response devices feature one touch access to our caring center and services like urgent response, fall detection and more, providing patients and caregivers with a peace of mind that care is only a call away. Last year, we launched our new Lively brand and a Lively partnership with Apple to feature our health and safety services on Apple Watch. And today, I\u2019m happy to announce Lively on Alexa, which will launch this spring. Our Lively monthly subscription service provides a consistent revenue stream. And last year, we drove 15% year-over-year growth by adding 348,000 new lives served. Our caring center agents connected with our customers over 9 million times last year, offering a variety of health and safety services. So, let\u2019s jump back to Angela\u2019s story. Angela worries about her father living at home alone, so she purchases a Lively smartphone and an Amazon Echo for her dad from Best Buy, along with a monthly Lively health and safety subscription plan. Jacob uses his Lively Smart to request to lift drive to a doctor\u2019s office through a caring center agent. He has a minor fall at home and uses his Amazon Echo to alert the caring center, who can follow protocol to determine if emergency medical services are needed. And this patient journey is just one example of the many ways Lively supports active aging adults at home. Now let\u2019s look at virtual care. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps the most exciting opportunity lies within virtual care, where we enable patients to connect with their care teams. In November, we acquired Current Health. Current Health is making inroads into care at home through securing strong partnership -- strong partnerships with successful programs at Baptist Health, Mount Sinai, AbbVie, the Defense Health Agency and more. Our acquisition merges Current Health\u2019s FDA-cleared at home platform with Best Buy\u2019s scale, expertise and connection to the home. Together, we create a powerful virtual care experience. Jacob is in the hospital with [indiscernible]. The hospital physician identifies and enrolls Jacob into the hospital\u2019s hospital-at-home program. Best Buy sets up Jacob\u2019s home with the technology needed for remote patient monitoring and trains both, Jacob and Angela on how to use it. This ensures the hospital physician can focus on treating patients rather than being a tech consultant. This is a job that physicians had to play during the pandemic, and it overtaxed our health system. At home, Jacob is monitored by Current Health\u2019s platform and a virtual command center. The hospital physician checks in daily with video visits to ensure he\u2019s healing on track. The command center coordinates Jacob\u2019s home medications and notices a lack of data from his monitor. After discovering that he\u2019s improperly wearing the device, Geek Squad is deployed to a system. The platform\u2019s algorithm alerts the command center that Jacob has a persistent fever and the on-call health system physician prescribes therapeutic, which is delivered by the pharmacy partner. When Jacob recovers, the hospital physician discharges Jacob, and Jacob continues to be supported by Lively. A few of the pieces in this patient journey are still in development. The Geek Squad integrated with Current Health, for example, but this is our direction. And you can see Best Buy is there for the patient with technology, support and connections to enable care at home. And we\u2019re not building this alone. We\u2019re creating an ecosystem to support consumers and their care-at-home journey. Consumers are at the heart of our strategy, and throughout a lifetime of health needs, Best Buy is there to help enrich and save lives through technology and meaningful connections. As I mentioned earlier, our health opportunity creates a flywheel, driving growth in all three focal areas. Our revenue in fiscal year \u201822 was $525 million. We\u2019re growing 35% to 45% a year, and we are accretive in fiscal year \u201827 as the health industry has a longer return on investment. Thank you for your time, and I\u2019ll turn it back to Matt.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you, Deborah. You\u2019ve heard details from Corie, Jason, Damien and Deborah about some key areas that give us excitement about the opportunity in front of us. We firmly believe our differentiated capabilities and focused investments will lead to compelling returns over time. While fiscal \u201822 was certainly an amazing year, we see a path to even higher revenue and earnings by fiscal \u201825. And as we look beyond fiscal \u201825, we see even more opportunity for revenue growth and operating income rate expansion as the benefits from our initiatives like Totaltech and Best Buy Health grow even further. Before I share additional details on our fiscal \u201825 targets, I would like to review a few guiding behaviors that have been our brand for several years. First, we plan to fund our growth through the cash we generate and return excess cash to shareholders. Second, we are committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set at 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal \u201825. We achieved approximately $200 million during fiscal \u201822, picking our cumulative total to $700 million towards the $1 billion goal. Let me take a moment to reflect on our past performance. We have talked about our record results over the past couple of years, but it is also important to note that we have had very steady growth in the years leading up to the pandemic. This past year was the eighth straight year of comparable sales growth. In addition, we have expanded our operating income rate, earnings per share and ROI. Earlier in the presentation, we shared our fiscal \u201825 targets, so I won\u2019t cover them in detail here, but I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on our fiscal \u201825 assumptions. We expect our revenue in fiscal \u201825 to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion. This range reflects a three-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 1% to 3%, despite the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal \u201823. I would also note that due to expected store closures, our comparable sales CAGR would be approximately 2% to 4%. There are a few key assumptions underlying the revenue expectations. First, as Corie shared, we believe the consumer electronics industry will remain significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic, and we expect that fiscal \u201825 will be back to a level similar to fiscal \u201822. Second, we believe we have an opportunity to capture even more market share than we have in the past. This is due to growth from Totaltech and the store initiatives that Damien talked about. As it relates to Totaltech, we believe that the combination of membership revenue and incremental purchases by members will add approximately $1.5 billion in revenue by fiscal \u201825 compared to fiscal \u201823. This is a net impact. So, it incorporates the impact of cannibalizing other standalone services now part of our membership offering. Of course, we also expect revenue growth from Best Buy Health and the expansion into additional categories that Jason shared earlier. As we move to our fiscal \u201825 operating income rate outlook, we expect to expand our rate to a range of 6.3% to 6.8%. As we have highlighted, Totaltech is currently pressuring our fiscal \u201823 operating income rate. Health has also been an area of investment for us over the past few years. However, as each of them scales, we expect them both to meaningfully contribute to our fiscal \u201825 rate outlook. We also see opportunities to lean in even further on capabilities like our in-house media business, Best Buy Ads, which as Corie mentioned earlier, is fueled by our first-party data. We expect this business will benefit our fiscal \u201823 operating income with benefits increasing in the out years. In addition, we expect to see rate benefits from our continued focus on finding cost efficiencies that benefit both, gross profit and SG&A. Damien highlighted a number of strategies that are part of this effort. As we\u2019ve discussed over the past few years, technology will be critical in unlocking many of these opportunities. Of course, there are areas where we will likely see pressure on our rate in the future. The first example of this is pricing. Throughout most of the pandemic, the level of promotions in our categories has been well below levels of fiscal \u201820. This has been largely a result of higher demand and more challenged or constrained inventory environment. We have seen pockets of promotional activity increase over the past two quarters, and our belief is that the promotions will continually progress back to fiscal \u201820 levels. A second area I would highlight is increased spend in technology in our store portfolio. As we have shared over a number of quarters, our technology spend has been increasing in support of our initiatives and overall omnichannel experience. In addition, we expect more depreciation expense from our capital investments in our stores. Lastly, there are a few other factors we will continue to assess, but at this point, don\u2019t see as being a material to our rate in fiscal \u201825 compared to fiscal \u201823. First, from a store labor standpoint, we expect to maintain expenses at a similar rate of revenue. We will continue to invest in higher pay for our employees, but expect to balance the higher wages to efficiencies, leveraging technology and more flexible workforce. Second, we do not expect channel mix to have a material impact to our rate. As Damien shared earlier, our outlook assumes closing 20 to 30 stores per year through fiscal \u201825. This assumption reflects our belief that the online channel mix will grow approximately to 40% in fiscal \u201825. We will continue to apply a rigorous process for lease renewals to ensure we are comfortable with the financial return and overall customer experience. Currently, the vast majority of our stores are cash flow positive, and we believe are essential for us to serve our customers. I\u2019ll move next to our cash flow and our capital allocation approach. To start with, we have been generating healthy levels of free cash flow for several years, which provides us ample room to fund our growth investments. Our average annual free cash flow over the past five years is more than $2.3 billion. Our capital allocation strategy has been consistent for several years. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive growth, highlighted by the strategies you\u2019ve heard today. This includes both, capital expenditures and operating expense investments. Next, we may explore additional partnerships and acquisitions if we believe they will accelerate our ability to achieve more profitable growth. We also plan to continue to be a premium dividend payer and return excess cash through share repurchases. Let me quickly expand on a few of these areas. We expect our annual capital expenditures to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the next three years. Earlier, Damien outlined a number of changes to our stores to further our strategy. Consistent with our iterative approach, we will test, learn and deploy once we have vetted anticipated returns of our initiatives. Technology investments are expected to remain similar to fiscal \u201823, simply decreasing as a mix of our capital deployment. This morning, we announced a 26% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share. Our targeted dividend payout remains in the range of 35% to 45% of prior year\u2019s non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Lastly, this year marked a record level of share repurchases at $3.5 billion. In fiscal \u201823, we plan to spend approximately $1.5 billion on share repurchases. So, with that, let me turn the stage back over Corie.\nCorie Barry: Thank you so much, Matt. Extraordinary ecosystems have formed over the pass 20, 30, 40 years as digital has transformed every aspect of how we all do business. That same transformation is happening our homes, meaningfully accelerated in the last two years. And while we started as a music retailer, selling fun to have products, we\u2019re now the only company built around the same extraordinary transformation of technology in our lives and in our homes. While others sell some of the same products we do, we alone offered the complete technology solution across manufacturers and operating systems. We are the only company in all channels and at scale that can do everything from design your personalized hardware and software solution in home, to install and connect all of it, to keep it working when there are any issues from unreliable networks to broken screens. These assets appeal not only to our customers but they are also unique and investable for our marketing partners, technology vendors, small business and education relationships and other strategic connections. As we look to the future, we see technology as a permanent and growing need in the home, constantly evolving as the world\u2019s largest companies innovate with new use cases around the metaverse, transportation, green electricity and health, just to name a few. We have a unique value creation opportunity into the future and are investing now as we\u2019ve successfully invested ahead of change in our past to ensure we pivot to meet the needs of our customers and retain our exclusive position in our industry. We are excited to help customers enrich lives through technology in ways no one else can. And with we will break for 10 minutes before beginning our Q&A session. [Break]\nCorie Barry: Welcome back. We are excited to begin the Q&A portion of our event, which we expect to run approximately 45 minutes. But before we do, I want to take this opportunity to introduce and welcome Mark Irvin, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. Many of you spent time with Rob Bass and may know that he recently announced that he is stepping away from a life in retail to pursue some other passions, as we have been discussing for quite some time. We are so excited for him and thank him for his incredible work on our supply chain transformation. That incredible work extended to his ability to bring in top tier talent. One example of that is Mark Irvin, who came to Best Buy in 2013, specifically to work with and learn from Rob. Mark has been an instrumental part of the team that has led our supply chain transformation and is ready to use his lifetime of knowledge in the space to continue to advance our industry-leading supply chain efforts. We are thrilled to have Mark Irvin taking over the reins in supply chain. And we\u2019ve invited him to join us for Q&A. So, operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, ma\u2019am. Your first question is from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Mr. Chris Horvers, your line is now open. Moving on to the next question, Mr. Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey. Hopefully you can hear me and hopefully my mugshot doesn\u2019t stay on as Chris\u2019s. Okay, great. So, my first question is on the industry outlook. So, you\u2019re effectively saying that the industry will revert or digest in \u201822. And I want to make sure I understand that in \u201823 it starts to grow. Can you talk about why does it grow, why doesn\u2019t this revert for two years, given the consumption growth we\u2019ve had? I assume it\u2019s having to do with the innovation and shorter replacements. But, why doesn\u2019t that begin in \u201824 as opposed to \u201823?\nCorie Barry: Yes, I\u2019ll start and maybe Matt can add some color. I think that what we\u2019re looking at is, as you said, a little bit of a step back in the next year as we lap some of the stimulus. But, I think, there is a number of factors and we outlined some of them in the prepared remarks that we believe will continue to boost the inventory as we head to the other side of next year. So, some of the things that we cited, first of all, you have this real phenomenon where technology is all over our homes, and we are very dependent on that technology and this nesting factor being in our homes is a very sticky behavior. And that\u2019s because secondarily, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is leveraging tech and people are saying they expect to continue to do that, things like streaming or learning or obviously, all of us probably in some way, shape or form, hybrid working. Those are really -- gaming is another great example. Those are really sticky behaviors that we continue to expect to see over time. And not only that, now you\u2019ve got 2 times as many connected devices in the home as you had two years ago. So, you have this proliferation of devices. And because the innovation cycles are continuing to ramp, we\u2019re also seeing in most of our key categories that replacement cycle already start to shorten. We could literally see it in the last two years in our customers that replacement cycle is shortening. And so, while we think there\u2019s a bit of a step back next year, all of this massive interest in the industry, the new ways that people are using technology, the innovations that are happening in spaces like metaverse or some of the things that Jason talked about in his prepared remarks, all of those, we believe, start to create that ramp as we get on the other side of a little bit step back in the next year.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up to Totaltech, this will just have a couple of pieces, but I promise it\u2019s all Totaltech related. Any quantification of the impact to the EBIT or EBIT dollars in \u201822 or fiscal \u201823? Can you share what you think or expecting or modeling for renewal for year one of Totaltech? And then, you mentioned you\u2019re seeing 20% lift in some of the early sign-ups. Is there a danger or risk you\u2019re basing that off of the period of very good consumption when there was stimulus money hanging around. So, how are you confident that\u2019s a good level to think about going forward?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I\u2019ll start maybe and then Matt can talk a little bit about the EBIT. On the renewal, we haven\u2019t come out with renewal rates. The good news is they continue to be in line with our expectations. So, we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re seeing from a renewal perspective, but we do want to give that a bit of time. I think to your second question around the period of time that we\u2019re using. First, we\u2019ve been overt in saying it is a short period of time. We just rolled this out in October, but we wanted to at least give some color on what we\u2019re seeing. Second, while you\u2019re right, this is a unique period of time, we\u2019re comparing it against a control group in the same period of time. So all of the behaviors that we comparing -- because what we\u2019re looking at in that 20% lift is a lift in people who purchased and are using Totaltech versus those who would not or had not purchased it. And so, you\u2019ve got a comparative group there. So, both behaviors in theory should be different. But still, it\u2019s holiday, like we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s a short period of time. We wanted to give the initial color, and then we\u2019ll keep watching that as we go through the next year, obviously.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. And maybe just to adjust the overall impact to EBIT next year, we talked about the OI rate being at 5.4% and last year ended at 6%. That decline is mostly coming from our gross profit rate decline. And the majority of that gross profit rate decline has been -- is due to the Totaltech membership rollout. As you know, we launched the membership in Q3 -- at the end of Q3 last year, and we don\u2019t cycle that until Q3 of next year, FY23. So, that majority of that gross profit decline is coming from the Totaltech launch, to give you a general size of the impact.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan.\nChris Horvers: Thank you. Clearly, I need some Totaltech support there. So, I guess, my first question is a bit of a follow-up. You talked about a 2% to 4% CAGR over the next three years. If you\u2019re down at the midpoint, it looks like you\u2019re embedding, if -- check my math, roughly like a 5% comp in the out two years. And if you look back 2015 and 2019, you sort of did a 3%. So, a two-part question is, first, what drives the confidence in that? And then, the second part of it is, are you assuming share gains in core categories, like PC and TV? And to what extent is the contributor from these new opportunity categories that you\u2019ve talked about?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So essentially, you\u2019re right that roughly, as we think about our path to FY25, FY23, we talked about it being down as the industry is assumed to be in the low single digits to mid single digits. As you move to FY25, that would assume a higher pace of growth in those couple of years, not necessarily being linear, but a little higher pace of growth than we have historically. What gives us confidence in the ability to do that is a lot of the initiatives that you heard today. So, we\u2019ve outlined a number of things, Totaltech changes to our stores, expanding our assortment, growing into Best Buy Health. Those things give us confidence in being able to accelerate our sales as we look out past FY23. What\u2019s assumed in that number as well is essentially, we would expect to still modestly gain share on a baseline of our business but then be able to accelerate our share growth with these initiatives that we talked about and then expand our markets with the items that Jason shared and also Best Buy Health as well.\nChris Horvers: Understood. And then, my follow-up question is any further cadence commentary on the top line? Obviously, you got a couple of years of stimulus here in the first quarter. Is it fair to think that 1Q is the low point in the year? And if you hit the midpoint of the range, or is your expectation that in the fourth quarter you could flip to the positive?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. So, what we outlined was a minus 1 to minus 4 comp for FY23. We also talked about how the weight of that decline is in the first half of the year. So, you could assume that something maybe towards the bottom end of that range for -- or a little worse on first half of this year. So, you could imagine any number of outcomes as you look at the back half.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.\nKaren Short: [Technical Difficulty] these other elements that are going to flow into the P&L. But wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you think the actual four-wall margin structure will do in the time period from today until fiscal \u201825. And then, I had one other follow-up.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I\u2019m not sure I caught the entirety of the first part of that question. But, in terms of the store four-wall operating rate in the future. We would expect to continue to find efficiencies in our store operating. Damien outlined a number of things that we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s also important to know that the store is connected to the broadness of how our whole business works from an omnichannel perspective, whether it\u2019s the store, our digital presence, our chat or virtual sales that we\u2019re now engaging in. So, we\u2019re always going to find ways to create efficiencies. Obviously, there are some levels of inflation in fixed costs within our stores that we\u2019re always choosing to navigate, but we would expect that there\u2019s still opportunities for us to continue to drive a better outcome on the store side from a profitability standpoint.\nCorie Barry: Karen, I just want to underscore, it is incredibly difficult for us to separate the performance of the stores from digital performance from what Matt was alluding to virtual and call. And if you think about Q4 alone, 65%ish of what we sold online was either picked up in stores. That was about 45%, or shipped from a store. That was about 20%. And so, when you have that amount of crossover, literally -- I mean, it\u2019s the best example of like true omnichannel behaviors with our customers. Piecing those things apart is incredibly difficult. Understand, what we\u2019re trying to do, to Matt\u2019s point, is really build in effectiveness and efficiency across those. So, you create those real frictionless experiences for customers. You have both the convenience, but you also have that amazing experience when they want it.\nKaren Short: No. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I\u2019m just curious, with respect to the Charlotte test, any color or metrics you can give on the overall margin, I guess, and/or sales lift in that store? I realize that there\u2019s a decline in sales floor square footage. But, any timeline on unrolling that out to other markets?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I\u2019ll start and maybe Damien can add some color. We aren\u2019t yet providing any of the metrics on performance. And that\u2019s because it still is, A, relatively new, and B, this is how a bunch of stores are working together. And I just want to underscore back to the first question that you asked. The beautiful thing about Charlotte is we\u2019re really trying to say, what do our stores need to do in the future. Obviously, our online penetration has doubled in the last two years. And that means the role of the store is different. The store is incredibly important. It showcases all the experiences. It is the cornerstone for convenience. And as Matt said in the prepared remarks, more than 99% of our stores are cash flow positive. So, in and of itself, the stores are amazing experiential moments with our customers. And we know that the role of the store will continue to evolve. And what we want to make clear with Charlotte is this is a market now with the same quantity of stores before and after. But, you have 24% less selling square footage, 100% more warehousing and fulfillment and an overall reduction in square footage of 9% in the market. But, you also have consultants going into home. You have more access points than ever, and you cover the market, about 41% of it, with employee delivery. And so, what you\u2019re trying to do is create a bigger draw in the market for more customers because you just have all these different experiences. Damien, I don\u2019t know if you have anything you want to add?\nDamien Harmon: The only thing I would add is, traditionally, we\u2019ve looked at one store at a time and how that particular store can create an experience for a customer. Now, you\u2019re looking at the full portfolio, all of our assets in a particular geography, and you\u2019re finding ways to be able to navigate that customer experience and what they\u2019re expecting across a multitude of different experiences. I think, that\u2019s what\u2019s really important is, we\u2019ve never done that before because it\u2019s been in each individual store. Now being able to say across a 15,000 or 25,000 or a 35,000 square-foot store in an outlet experience and our consultation labor, we can take care of that customers\u2019 needs across the board, and our teams are working across the stores. Our teams are working across different customer expectations and really delivering a unique experience in that marketplace. And we\u2019re continuing to learn over time, and then we\u2019ll apply that as we see what\u2019s working best for us or what\u2019s not.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: I guess, I\u2019d like to start on understanding a little bit more about the pricing commentary that you made in your outlook for the next couple of years. And if we look at just average unit size versus number of transactions last year, could you give us that? And then, help us understand as you get that 2% to 4% comp, how much of it do you expect from ASP as opposed to transactions?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure, I can start and then Corie can jump in, too. If I look just outward towards our FY25 goals, we talked about how we\u2019ll always need to be price competitive in our business. So, that is fundamental to how our consumers want to interact with us and to the market. And so, we\u2019ll always make the right decisions to be price competitive and create value for them. If I think about what happened this last quarter in terms of ASPs and units and transactions and thus last year, on a year-over-year basis, a lot of our growth and most of our growth is coming from ASP increases, which was coming from a couple of different avenues. So, premium mix is up. That\u2019s the majority of our ASP increases. Secondly, we have some pricing increases from what we\u2019ve been seeing from inflation, but the majority is that premium mix. Transactions and traffic were down in the quarter, as you would imagine from a sales -- the sales decline. But it\u2019s important to note, too, if you look all the way back into our history, ASPs have been increasing year after year after year. There\u2019s an interesting dynamic happening in our organics, which can distort the view of organics in total. We\u2019ve been seeing actually unit and transaction growth and ASP growth in our higher ASP areas like computing and appliances and televisions. Where we\u2019re seeing the unit declines and transaction is on the very low ASP items, things that have been shifting over to the digital mediums like gaming software or music or movies. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s creating some of the dynamic on the units and transactions. So, we really like the fact that our units and our ASPs are growing in those areas where we can really create a better experience for our customers in totality. I think, you addressed next year. Next year, I think we don\u2019t plan our business based on ASPs and units and transactions. We would continue to expect, though, that as our business shifts and we start -- you see our Totaltech offers and our better experiences start to take hold that our ASP and our premium mix would continue to grow and provide a better solution overall, but also be able to add in some of those lower ASP items as we continue to create a better experience holistically.\nGreg Melich: Great. I\u2019d love to follow up on that a little bit on the Best Buy Advertising. Is that more of a revenue opportunity or a margin opportunity? And how important is it? Is that basically selling ads to current vendors, or are there opportunities more broadly?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I\u2019ll start. I think that there are broad opportunities in the Best Buy Ads business. Obviously, we have what we would call audiences or kind of suites of customers and information about those customers that\u2019s certainly very valuable to our vendors, which is where we over-index right now but can be more valuable broadly to other partners who might be looking for potential consumers who have the kind of same look and feel as our consumer base. And so, while we start kind of near in with those who really understand this unique customer that we have and the unique knowledge we have with that customer, everything from service interactions to purchase interactions to how they decide to use the approximately, all of these are important behavioral points that are important, not just to our vendors, but ultimately, probably to a wider swath of partners. I don\u2019t know if you want to hit on how the financials.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. The Best Buy Ads business, for now, it\u2019s -- most of that\u2019s coming through our current vendors. And when that\u2019s the case, what it does, it actually drives margin rate is recorded as an offset to cost of sales. So overall, when you take that in addition to the SG&A required to drive it, it does create an OI rate positive experience for us, but it is more of a rate offset in margin. To the extent we drive more sales with people that aren\u2019t our vendors and we go outside of our ecosystem, that actually would then show up into revenue in the future.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba: First thing I wanted to clarify is that picture is not a catfishing situation that I actually do look very similar to that right now as we speak. So, I just wanted to clear that up. But, in terms of my actual questions, I guess, you mentioned that the promotional -- promotions did increase year-over-year. And obviously, that\u2019s kind of a -- it sounds like it\u2019s a sort of end of pandemic type of normalization to some extent. I guess, my first question is, I guess, were promotional levels relative to the fourth quarter, I guess, 2020?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I\u2019ll start and maybe Jason can jump in after that. Compared to FY20, some of our categories actually did start to get close to or back to FY20 levels in Q4. So, there were places we saw more promotionality in Q4 on a year-over-year basis and as it relates back to \u201820 where things like computing, headphones and wearables and even TV started to get back to levels close to FY20. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been seeing some of the more promotions in this last quarter. We actually saw computing start to be more promotional on a yearly basis back in Q3. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting to see. And you\u2019re right, as we look to FY23, we would expect more and more categories to start to return to more normal FY20 levels based on how inventory starts to flow. There are some still inventory things we\u2019re watching in terms of the chipsets and some supply constraints. But as inventory starts to normalize and get into next year for more categories, we would expect more of them to return to levels closer to FY20.\nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. And you talked a little bit about this in the press release. Just even directionally, what was the impact from, I guess, supply chain issues, product availability issues on your fourth quarter results? And what do you expect the impact to be, even just directionally on your F 2023 guidance?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. We did see some pressure from freight warehousing in Q4. It wasn\u2019t as material as some of the other things we\u2019ve talked about. So, we are seeing higher rates come through just the transportation and carrier mix of what we\u2019re having to supply. It was offset a little bit by a parcel reduction. So overall, there was a little bit more pressure in Q4. As you think about next year, we are expecting to see freight warehousing continue to be a pressure as we continue to move through the year, not as material as some other things that we\u2019ve laid out, but it would be something that we\u2019re going to continue to navigate over the next number of quarters.\nCorie Barry: And Anthony, I think the other part of your question was around the inventory levels that we saw in Q4. And we haven\u2019t sized it specifically, but I think it\u2019s fair to say we would have been healthy in our range, had we not had some of those very targeted -- and again, I want to be clear. They\u2019re very targeted inventory constraints that were just a bit larger than we thought. And I think we expect to see some of those continue into, especially the first half of next year and again in a more targeted way. But our overall inventory situation, I think that\u2019s some of what you\u2019re seeing in the promotional environment, our overall inventory situation is very healthy. I mean, they are year up 6%, 15% versus two years ago. So, it\u2019s just these pockets where we\u2019ve seen more demand, so that\u2019s good, but a little bit more constrained than we were expecting.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Best Buy has a long history of doing what it says it\u2019s going to do, setting realistic expectations and then following through on those expectations. If you do get some feedback or there is sentiment coming out of this event, it might be that you set really aggressive targets over the next few years, especially on the profitability side to put some perspective around that. The midpoint of the 6.3% to 6.8% operating margin expectation would be 50 basis points better than what Best Buy\u2019s ever done in the past, and that was during a pandemic. And get to the midpoint, Best Buy will be able to achieve 50 basis points of annual operating margin in fiscal \u201824 and fiscal \u201825, whereas prior to the pandemic, it was generating about 20 basis points of annual operating margin expansion. So, as you look out, what\u2019s changed about the model to make it more -- that much more profitable than Best Buy has been in the past? Is it really healthcare, advertising? You\u2019ve been able to master the profitability of the online business? And as part of that, could you talk about the contribution from Totaltech, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Health and cost reductions inefficiencies, would they all equally contribute to the profitability expectations a couple of years from now?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I\u2019ll take that from a couple of different angles, Michael. First, I\u2019d say, over the last couple of years, this team you see on the camera, everyone in the building and the field have been doing amazing job just navigating and accelerating a number of the strategies to lift our business and improve the profitability over the last couple of years managing through the pandemic. There is certainly a number of things we\u2019ve changed about our operating model that has allowed us to navigate very easily through store channel to an omnichannel to now a virtual channel and the chat situation. So, the team has done an amazing job just finding ways to efficiently operate this business, and that\u2019s helping us drive profitability now and as we look forward. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. As you look to the out years in terms of profitability, we have been -- we\u2019ve been talking about investments in areas like health and technology. And now we\u2019re talking about investing in our stores. All those things are intended to pay back, not just payback from a sales perspective, but also continue to improve from a rate and an operating dollar and an operating rate perspective as well. So, they are, as we\u2019ve laid out in our materials, ways we\u2019re going to help expand our rate from FY23 up to the range of 6.3% to 6.8% in FY25. We believe those initiatives will help generate more profit -- being more accretive over time. And at the same time, we\u2019ll keep working hard to make -- create the efficiencies in our stores and navigate through the different channels very seamlessly. We\u2019ll never stop trying to find those improvements. And this team has been hard at work doing that.\nCorie Barry: Michael, I think you have stacked -- and you actually nailed and laid out a lot of them. But you have this kind of stacked quantity of things that both have happened and that we\u2019re investing in. I mean, we have tremendously more scale than we had just two years ago with $8 billion added to the top line. And obviously, that -- majority all coming through are digital experiences. So, we\u2019ve navigated a massive change in the composition of our business. Under that, we\u2019ve also created material efficiency and effectiveness because I think it\u2019s really important to note, we also noted in prepared remarks, in Q4, we saw some of our best NPS results, particularly on the in-store side of things, our teams are doing incredible work garnering skills. 80% of our associates have more than one skill, which allows us to move this labor really flexibly and allows really interesting career paths. So, you\u2019ve got scale, you\u2019ve got a really efficient and effective model that now has moved through this changing dynamic. And then, we\u2019re layering on top distinct initiatives that we have expectations around return. Totaltech being one, the ads business being another, the health business that we\u2019re investing in for our future, the store experience side of things, all of these. We are using behavioral history that we\u2019re seeing in our customers to help us predict how we think this model looks in the future. And I would just underscore what Matt said, I give the team a great deal of credit for choosing to double down on these investments now because we do think this is what unlocks exponential growth for us as we head into the future.\nMichael Lasser: That\u2019s helpful perspective. My follow-up question is, embedded in your guidance for the next couple of years is it looks like a mid-single-digit comp for the domestic business. If it proves that it\u2019s more like a 3% top line growth for the domestic business from 2024 and 2025, can you still get to the 6.3% to 6.8% operating margin, or should we think more like a 6% operating margin in that scenario?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. Certainly, the ranges we gave from a revenue and OI perspective have those ranges on all the initiatives and various components of our plan. So, we would continue to strive for those targets that we gave for operating rate income, despite maybe coming at the bottom end of that scale. There\u2019s obviously a range when come to the initiatives, but also just the work in our baseline or business to create efficiency. So, we would continue to target that even if it was towards the lower end. But obviously, we\u2019re going to make the right decisions for the long term. So, we\u2019ll always choose to invest as we need to along the way.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: So, getting to the margin, I was wondering if you could give us like cadence. Obviously, you\u2019re going to be down to the -- this year but then sharply up in \u201824 and \u201825. I mean, is it balanced between those two years, or is it mostly expected in \u201825, the improvements?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. So, we haven\u2019t given the numbers for FY24. So, obviously, we\u2019re giving us up a little bit of flexibility in how we get to the FY25 goals, not just in terms of the lines of P&L, but even the years as well. We would expect to see improvements each year, if you will, the general size is we haven\u2019t actually sized for anyone, but we wouldn\u2019t expect to see improvements as we progress in each of the years going forward.\nScott Mushkin: Okay. And then, my second question is, obviously, on the revenue side, there\u2019s some pretty ambitious targets. I think, Michael was talking about that a second ago. But, I was wondering, you\u2019re obviously attacking new areas and new categories. When you think about the comp, how much is coming from those new areas? And how much is it increasing your addressable market? I know you threw $300 million out there. But, is your market now actually going to be bigger than that as you attack new areas for the business?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. We didn\u2019t size the -- expanding our assortment within the numbers. We gave some indication for some of the other areas that if you go from the mid-range of FY23 to FY25, that\u2019s about $5 billion. Totaltech was $1.5 billion of that number, and that includes the cannibalization of the standalone services and offerings that we have. We also talked about how health is at $525 million today and that we\u2019re going to grow at a high CAGR rate over the next number of years that would indicate that by FY25, it\u2019s about $900 million of growth, too. So we\u2019re breaking those parts out. What\u2019s left is what we would expect to expand in our -- from our categories and our physical assets. So, we would expect those to provide some meaningful growth as well as the other items.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Keith from Piper Sandler.\nPeter Keith: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll also echo a great presentation today. First question I had was just around Best Buy Health. We\u2019ve been talking about this, I feel like for about five years. So, it seems like we\u2019re making some progress. But I was wondering if you could also kind of look back in terms of what hasn\u2019t worked that you\u2019ve learned and discontinued versus what you\u2019re leaning into more aggressively as you see future opportunity.\nCorie Barry: Maybe I\u2019ll start with a little bit of context, and then I\u2019ll ask Deborah to come in since she came in partway through the journey. I think it\u2019s maybe not as much about what -- maybe what didn\u2019t perform as well. I think it\u2019s what we\u2019re learning about a consumer that has changed a great deal, particularly in the last two years. So, some of those early hypotheses we had around health moving into the home, around people wanting to age in their homes with technology, I think those hypotheses were actually exponentially sped up over the last couple of years. And, we started to see some new use cases around virtual care in particular. So, I think, we felt like we were pointed in the right direction even three, four years ago. It\u2019s just that the consumer behaviors have really changed in the last two years, having gone through the pandemic. And now we\u2019re refining our focus a bit so that we really target where the industry is going. Maybe Deborah, you could add some color.\nDeborah Di Sanzo: Corie, I think you pretty much covered most of it. I think I would just say, in the active aging space, we -- people will continue to actively age in their home, live independently in their home. If you think about it, we target -- consumers are 65 years and older, and these consumers like -- actually, they like a physical store experience. So, that in the past couple of years, when our stores were closed, we couldn\u2019t go in. We couldn\u2019t see the phones. We couldn\u2019t see the personal emergency response devices. We really saw that pick up, though, in Q4 of this year. So, we are very optimistic about that market. And I just want to emphasize what Corie said, again, really in the pandemic, consumers thoughts of digital health changed dramatically. In the health technology space for about a decade, people have been talking about the consumerization of healthcare, but the pandemic really brought the consumerization of health care. So, now consumers want to take care of themselves and their family in their home 365 days a year. They do it with technology, and they need help with that technology. And I think that with Best Buy enabling them to connect with their physician, helping them with their technology is really what\u2019s driving our optimism in the market.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Thank you. Maybe another question, I would want to pivot over to Jason on some of the macro and product trends. Here again, 5G, we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years. It seems like it\u2019s starting to come to life; metaverse, maybe a couple of years out. Could you bring those to life for us a little bit more in terms of types of products you would expect to sell and how you might be involved from a services implementation as we think about product cycles in these areas?\nJason Bonfig: Thanks for the question. 5G, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see happen at more of a market level. So, it will be almost a rolling change as it hits the individual markets and the potential for that additional speed is unlocked with customers. That shows up not only in products, but it also just shows up in the ability to make more connected products, the expansion into things like tablets, watches, laptops to really take advantage of that faster connection. The other area is metaverse is very, very much alive, and we\u2019re seeing the trends with our customers. When we look at VR, our VR business grew double year-over-year in Q4, but actually also for the entire fiscal year of FY22, showing the customer interest in wanting to experience the metaverse, want to try some of the different things from a virtual reality perspective. And the amount of products and the amount of customers just will continue to evolve as they find more and more ways to take advantage of the technology that\u2019s going to just continue to expand experiences for customers and the ability to plug into these new networks and new experiences as we move forward.\nCorie Barry: And Peter, to your question about services, this is so interesting. Because what we\u2019re seeing is this really high level of interest and yet confusion around what it is and what I do. I just read a survey that said that 70% of consumers age 65 and older want to try VR experiences, but aren\u2019t even sure exactly where to start. And so, sometimes this is consulting services in the home. But sometimes this is as simple as having that wide array of products from all of the vendors and just being willing to help people kind of dabble into, whether it\u2019s metaverse or 5G, which becomes really relevant as we\u2019re talking about getting out of our homes actually, and being on the go and being able to game and work and learn on the go. So, I think for us, this is long continuum, all the way from coming to the store and we can just help you understand what this is, all the way to, now I have twice as many conducted devices in my home. I want to learn how to leverage a 5G network and maybe get off Wi-Fi. How do I do all of that? And I think over time that -- again, from our unique point of view, that\u2019s where we can be helpful to the consumer.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo.\nZack Fadem: Can you help us bridge the gap from your current gross margin profile of 25.5? And help us understand what\u2019s embedded in the 6.5% EBIT margin target? And specifically, could you walk us through the expected Totaltech drag in 2023? How that\u2019s expected to normalize? And how we should think about the other moving parts mixing around new categories and promo, et cetera?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. So overall, for FY23, we\u2019ve talked about how the majority of that step back is -- in operating rate is driven by the Totaltech launch that we did in FY22. And so, we cycle that at the end. And so, what\u2019s essentially happening is the -- what used to be higher services gross profit rate is now being impacted by the launch of Totaltech, which is a much more complete offer. So, it includes product warranties, installation, things like that. So, the gross -- services gross profit rate is coming down, if you will. What we\u2019re doing though is driving more members much faster than we did in our previous service membership and driving more product incremental sales. The standalone offer is actually profitable on its own but we\u2019re navigating this period of time where we\u2019re cycling a different services offer and also building and scaling the incremental sales of the offer itself. So all that takes some time, and we\u2019re not necessarily pointed towards a gross profit rate or an SG&A rate. We\u2019re looking at driving OI rate over time and OI rate dollars over time. And so, we haven\u2019t given guidance over that period from FY25 because we\u2019re obviously going to give our self a little bit of flexibility as we navigate a very new offer in Totaltech as we understand just the incrementality and the frequency, but also just the usage. So, we haven\u2019t given those -- the breakouts of the different. We will also expect gross profit expansion in other areas, though. So, health has a very healthy gross profit rate. Best Buy Ads also has the ability to drive gross profit rates. There are things that help us mitigate what might come from a lower services gross profit rate in the future.\nZack Fadem: And on that OI rate expansion from 5.4 to 6.5 in 2025, it suggests a 100 basis-point improvement over a two-year period. Is it fair to assume that that will be evenly distributed in \u201824 and \u201825, or are there certain drivers or initiatives that are more weighted towards the front or back end?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. We haven\u2019t given the -- we\u2019re not going to give the exact breakout by initiative. But all of them are contributing to that OI rate expansion from \u201823 to the targets we gave for FY25. There are a lot of moving parts. But each of them, the initiatives of health and Best Buy -- or Totaltech as well as Ads, those are all contributing to the growth in the operating income rate.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities.\nScot Ciccarelli: So, I had a healthcare follow-up. I think in response to Peter\u2019s question, you guys were talking about an acceleration of consumer need for aging employees, et cetera. But I think your business has actually ramped slower than expected. So, what do you think the impediments have been to faster adoption? Is it the value equation? Is it an awareness issue, et cetera? And then, what can you do to accelerate the adoption of your healthcare services?\nDeborah Di Sanzo: Scot, thank you. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll take that. So, think about it this way. First of all, the health presentation that we presented today is a bit different than the strategy that you saw previously. So, this is really one strategic area, three focal points,, taking advantage of the rapid consumerization of healthcare, which did really not exist before two years ago. Second, we continue with active aging. People still do want to live healthy and happy and independently in their homes. And the third area of virtual care is also an era which essentially did not exist before the pandemic. Now hospitals want to have hospital home programs. They want to take care of helping people get better in their homes where they are surrounded by loved ones and feel comfortable. And so, hospitals all over the country are really putting in hospital at home programs, putting in chronic disease management programs. These are growth areas that did not exist before. Our focus before was in active aging. And as I said in my prior remarks, those are consumers 65 years and older and for our products, so the active aging products, they really appreciated a physical store experience. And so, when we had different hours in the last 21 months, when we had some store closures, it did impact the active aging business. But we see it now really -- we had a very strong Q4, and we see that continuing.\nScot Ciccarelli: Okay. Thanks. And then, a quick housekeeping item. Matt, given the economics of the Totaltech program, if membership actually grows faster than expected, does it take longer to kind of shift in the profitability mode?\nMatt Bilunas: Not necessarily. The growth in membership is indicative of the value of the offer, the interactions that they want to have with us. And so, we would see membership revenue grow, but also to the extent that members are growing, the incremental product sales that they would grow, would grow with that. So, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact the pace at which we could actually drive profitability.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Forbes from Guggenheim.\nSteven Forbes: I wanted to start with customer relationships event, maybe a topic from the last Analyst Day. So, Corie, if you can, really, if you frame where we are with those events across the various interactions and provide some high-level insight on how the relationship events over the past two years have or maybe amplify the business strategy that you laid out, supporting the upwardly revised targets?\nCorie Barry: Yes. So, if you go back to two, three -- two years ago, 2019, we talked about specifically these customer relationship events. And at the time, if you recall, we underscored things like using the app and having the app. We underscored at that point, Total Tech Support, which we\u2019ve now evolved into Totaltech obviously. We underscored customers who shop in multiple categories. They were like specific events that people who use our financial services. There were specific events that we were looking at that we said, when customers interact with us in this way, we tend to keep them in our ecosystem; they tend to spend more; they tend to be those more loyal customers. You can imagine, over the last two years, the good news is we have seen some acceleration in those type of events. We\u2019ve seen more app downloads. We\u2019re seeing a 72% increase in people using the app when they\u2019re in our stores, great. That\u2019s a great data point. We\u2019re seeing to what Matt just said, more people take up the Totaltech offering than we were seeing in total tech support, although that was still growing over the last couple of years. We\u2019re seeing more -- we just saw a whole bunch of new customers, and we\u2019re seeing those customers shop us in multiple categories. So, we\u2019re seeing that grow. I think you can see in the presentation that we gave today, it is still very important for us to continue to drive those customer -- deep customer relationships. And we\u2019re continuing to evolve how we see those interactions that are most important to those longer-term relationships and almost every strategy that we underscore today, whether it is what Damien talked about in terms of our more experiential stores, or whether it is Totaltech or whether it is a relationship with patient or someone we\u2019re helping to provide help for, all of those are the types of relationships that keep customers stickier to the brand. And given we talked a little bit, our frequency is a little bit lower than you can imagine, someone who has grocery or someone who has consumables. And so, this idea of increasing the frequency, staying relevant in the selection is really important to us. And that\u2019s, I think, what you can see all of the strategy is geared around those deeper and more prevalent customer relationships.\nSteven Forbes: That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up as we revisit the holistic market approach. Just curious what sort of incorporated around that strategy over the next two or three years in those longer-term targets that you laid out?\nMatt Bilunas: The holistic?\nCorie Barry: The markets. So, when Matt was talking about the capital guides that we kind of gave, you could see some of that increase in capital. At some point, we\u2019re assuming, and Damien talked specifically about the experiential stores, there probably will be some other store concepts that we may choose to roll. But, what I want to say is we\u2019ve been very clear that the Charlotte market is a pilot, and we mean that. Sometimes people say pilot and then they fully know exactly everything they\u2019re going to roll from there. It is a pilot. We are learning from it. And we assume that at some point, we will continue to roll pieces of that model. But, we\u2019re not yet ready to say this is exactly the concepts, exactly how many and exactly in what markets.\nMatt Bilunas: Sorry for the confusion there. Yes, we would assume there are some revenue impact and profitability impact from the broad work on our store portfolio, namely the experiential store rollouts that we\u2019re doing. And as we continue to look at the market approach, any other changes, we would include that into the revenue outcome as well.\nOperator: Your last question is from the line of Liz Suzuki from Bank of America.\nLiz Suzuki: Just a short-term one on the comp guidance. I guess, since two-year growth rates are starting to get thrown off by the start of COVID two years ago, do you think we should be looking at three-year growth rates as we think about the cadence of quarterly comp?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to look at two years and three-year stacks of growth rates. I think, the best guidance for us would be if you look at the next year\u2019s guide of 1% to 4% and think about the first half versus back half. The first half is going to see a bigger weighted sales decline just based on the 37 comp we did in Q1 last year and then the 20 comp in Q2. How that works out exactly -- it won\u2019t necessarily be even from a three-year perspective or a two-year perspective. But if you think about a first half, back half for next year is probably the easiest way. And then, think about the overall guide of 1% to 4% and how that -- where they may land in that order.\nLiz Suzuki: Got you. And then, I guess, just to that point on kind of three-year growth rate. I mean, the implication from the guidance would suggest some reacceleration from the fourth quarter exit rate. So, can you quantify the impact of Omicron and the inventory shortages on that fourth quarter comp, and if you consider those sales to have been lost permanently?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. We didn\u2019t quantify it. What we said is we believe we would have been pretty safely in the range of our revenue performance in Q4 if we hadn\u2019t had to reduce our store hours and if we had seen the level of inventory in certain products and categories that we were expecting. Some of that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be lost because people find that people do come back to us after maybe an attempt that they couldn\u2019t or if the product wasn\u2019t available. So, it isn\u2019t necessarily lost as you look into next year, but we do believe we would have been pretty safely in the range of revenue, had those two factors not happened.\nCorie Barry: Thank you so much. And with that, we will actually wrap today\u2019s investor event. And on behalf of our panelists and all of Best Buy, it has been our pleasure to share our progress with you, and we genuinely thank you for taking the time and all of your questions. Have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Thank you, Corie, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were all able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Our Q4 revenue was $16.4 billion. Our domestic comparable sales declined 2.1%, and our enterprise comp sales declined 2.3%. Revenue grew 8% versus two years ago. It was only slightly below the low end of our revenue guidance for the quarter due to a few factors. The first factor was inventory availability. We expected to have pockets of inventory constraints as we entered the quarter and called out a few areas, including appliances, gaming and mobile phones. As the quarter progressed, inventory was more constrained than we anticipated within a few categories and brands. These constraints included some high-demand holiday items, and the categories most impacted were mobile phones and computing. The second factor impacting our results was Omicron. The Omicron wave and the resulting high levels of employee callouts led to a temporary reduction in our store hours in January and to start fiscal \u201823. In mid-February, our staffing level started to improve and we increased store operating hours for the majority of our stores. Excluding these two factors, our revenue would have been comfortably in the guidance range we provided for the quarter. From a category standpoint, on a weighted basis the top areas with positive comparable sales growth included appliances, virtual reality, home theater and headphones. We saw comparable sales declines in gaming, mobile phones, tablets and services. Turning now to gross profit. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points to 20.2%. This was about 20 basis points lower than we expected, primarily due to increased proportionality. When comparing to last year, the largest driver was our services category, primarily driven by Totaltech. Our product margins were largely flat to last year, as the benefit from category sales mix was offset by increased promotions. Higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement was a benefit to gross profit rate compared to last year. Lastly, our international gross profit rate improved 210 basis points to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our enterprise results. Our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 5% versus last year, less than our guide of 8% growth, primarily due to lower than anticipated incentive compensation. Within our domestic segment, our SG&A dollars increased $139 million. The largest drivers were, one, advertising, which included campaigns for both, holiday and to drive awareness for our new membership offering; two, technology; three, increased store and call center labor that helped drive the record customer satisfaction scores Corie shared; and four, Best Buy Health, which includes the impact associated with our acquisition. Before I discuss the \u201823 financial outlook, let me spend some time on our new Totaltech membership program. Corie will provide a more holistic overview later in her presentation, but I will add some color on the impacts to our Q4 results and for next year. Totaltech is a near-term investment to dive long-term value. The thesis is that over time, we will capture incremental product sales from our members that will lead to higher operating income. But, as we discussed in prior earnings calls, it does come with near-term profitability impacts. First, at $199, the standalone membership is profitable. It just isn't as profitable as legacy service memberships, due to the breadth of benefits and the cost to fulfill them. Second, there is a loss of revenue and profit from existing revenue streams that are now included as benefits in the program. For example, previously standalone services like extended warranties and products installations are now included within our Totaltech membership. We still offer these services on a standalone basis or to nonmembers. But, you can imagine there's an aspect of cannibalization as members are no longer paying incrementally for these items. So, what does all this mean? We expect that the gross profit rate of our services category will reset to a new level going forward that is lower than it was prior to launching Totaltech. The way to drive more operating income, despite this lower services gross profit rate, is to add far more members than we thought was possible under our previous membership offerings. The key to increased profit will be through increased volume through a combination of more recurring membership revenue and incremental product purchases of our members. The number of memberships grew very nicely in Q4, and our plans for fiscal \u201823 assume continued growth, but it'll take some time to reach the scale necessary to offset the lower gross profit rate I just described. Therefore, Totaltech remains a pressure in fiscal \u201823, but we expect it to be a meaningful driver of both, higher sales and operating income dollars in fiscal \u201825 targets. Now, let's talk about our overall fiscal \u201823 outlook. Our guide is anchored around a comparable sales decline in the range of 1% to 4% and a 5.4% non-GAAP operating income rate. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook is $8.85 to $9.15. Before we discuss the broader assumptions driving our guide, I want to touch on our expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is planned at a more normalized level of 24.5% in fiscal \u201823 compared to 19% rate in fiscal \u201822. As you may recall, our Q2 results this past year included a $0.47 diluted EPS benefit from the resolution of certain discrete matters. Now, I'd like to share a few important assumptions underpinning our guidance. First, we anticipate the traditional CE industry to decline in the low- to mid-single digits next year as we lap the high levels of growth and stimulus actions from this past year. In addition, we anticipate the number of store closures to be in the range of 20 to 30, which is consistent with the trend over the past five years. As I mentioned, our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.4% compared to 6% in fiscal \u201822. To be clear, the biggest driver of the lower operating income rate in fiscal \u201823 is our investment in Totaltech. As I just described, this near-term pressure will drive long-term value for our shareholders. There are of course, other factors that we expect to impact our results that for the most part offset each other in fiscal \u201823. We do expect higher levels of promotional activity to pressure our gross profit rate, which is partially offset by the favorable impact of expected growth and our monetization of our advertising business, or Best Buy Ads. We expect our full year SG&A expense to be lower than fiscal \u201822 levels. The largest year-over-year variance is lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our plans after paying out at higher levels in fiscal \u201822 due to the overachieving of our performance targets. We expect the lower incentive comp to be partially offset by a few areas. The first area is higher technology cost, primarily due to annualizing spend in fiscal \u201822; the second area is higher depreciation and store remodel expense, as Damien will discuss later; and lastly, we expect to see higher SG&A dollars in support of our Best Buy Ads business. Finally, as you may have noticed, we are not providing quarterly guidance, but I would like to provide some insight on the assumed phasing for fiscal \u201823. Due to the strong first half comps last year, we expect our full year comparable sales decline to be weighted more heavily in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect to see significantly more year-over-year operating income rate pressure in the first half of the year compared to the back half. To summarize, the two largest variables for fiscal \u201823 financial results are the short-term industry declines as we lap high growth in government stimulus and the investment in our new membership program that will drive long-term value. As we look to fiscal \u201825, we expect the CE industry will return to the high levels we saw in fiscal \u201822 and that Totaltech will drive meaningful growth. I will now turn the meeting back over to Corie to begin our strategic update. Thank you, Deborah. You've heard details from Corie, Jason, Damien and Deborah about some key areas that give us excitement about the opportunity in front of us. We firmly believe our differentiated capabilities and focused investments will lead to compelling returns over time. While fiscal \u201822 was certainly an amazing year, we see a path to even higher revenue and earnings by fiscal \u201825. And as we look beyond fiscal \u201825, we see even more opportunity for revenue growth and operating income rate expansion as the benefits from our initiatives like Totaltech and Best Buy Health grow even further. Before I share additional details on our fiscal \u201825 targets, I would like to review a few guiding behaviors that have been our brand for several years. First, we plan to fund our growth through the cash we generate and return excess cash to shareholders. Second, we are committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set at 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal \u201825. We achieved approximately $200 million during fiscal \u201822, picking our cumulative total to $700 million towards the $1 billion goal. Let me take a moment to reflect on our past performance. We have talked about our record results over the past couple of years, but it is also important to note that we have had very steady growth in the years leading up to the pandemic. This past year was the eighth straight year of comparable sales growth. In addition, we have expanded our operating income rate, earnings per share and ROI. Earlier in the presentation, we shared our fiscal \u201825 targets, so I won't cover them in detail here, but I'd like to spend a few minutes on our fiscal \u201825 assumptions. We expect our revenue in fiscal \u201825 to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion. This range reflects a three-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 1% to 3%, despite the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal \u201823. I would also note that due to expected store closures, our comparable sales CAGR would be approximately 2% to 4%. There are a few key assumptions underlying the revenue expectations. First, as Corie shared, we believe the consumer electronics industry will remain significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic, and we expect that fiscal \u201825 will be back to a level similar to fiscal \u201822. Second, we believe we have an opportunity to capture even more market share than we have in the past. This is due to growth from Totaltech and the store initiatives that Damien talked about. As it relates to Totaltech, we believe that the combination of membership revenue and incremental purchases by members will add approximately $1.5 billion in revenue by fiscal \u201825 compared to fiscal \u201823. This is a net impact. So, it incorporates the impact of cannibalizing other standalone services now part of our membership offering. Of course, we also expect revenue growth from Best Buy Health and the expansion into additional categories that Jason shared earlier. As we move to our fiscal \u201825 operating income rate outlook, we expect to expand our rate to a range of 6.3% to 6.8%. As we have highlighted, Totaltech is currently pressuring our fiscal \u201823 operating income rate. Health has also been an area of investment for us over the past few years. However, as each of them scales, we expect them both to meaningfully contribute to our fiscal \u201825 rate outlook. We also see opportunities to lean in even further on capabilities like our in-house media business, Best Buy Ads, which as Corie mentioned earlier, is fueled by our first-party data. We expect this business will benefit our fiscal \u201823 operating income with benefits increasing in the out years. In addition, we expect to see rate benefits from our continued focus on finding cost efficiencies that benefit both, gross profit and SG&A. Damien highlighted a number of strategies that are part of this effort. As we've discussed over the past few years, technology will be critical in unlocking many of these opportunities. Of course, there are areas where we will likely see pressure on our rate in the future. The first example of this is pricing. Throughout most of the pandemic, the level of promotions in our categories has been well below levels of fiscal \u201820. This has been largely a result of higher demand and more challenged or constrained inventory environment. We have seen pockets of promotional activity increase over the past two quarters, and our belief is that the promotions will continually progress back to fiscal \u201820 levels. A second area I would highlight is increased spend in technology in our store portfolio. As we have shared over a number of quarters, our technology spend has been increasing in support of our initiatives and overall omnichannel experience. In addition, we expect more depreciation expense from our capital investments in our stores. Lastly, there are a few other factors we will continue to assess, but at this point, don't see as being a material to our rate in fiscal \u201825 compared to fiscal \u201823. First, from a store labor standpoint, we expect to maintain expenses at a similar rate of revenue. We will continue to invest in higher pay for our employees, but expect to balance the higher wages to efficiencies, leveraging technology and more flexible workforce. Second, we do not expect channel mix to have a material impact to our rate. As Damien shared earlier, our outlook assumes closing 20 to 30 stores per year through fiscal \u201825. This assumption reflects our belief that the online channel mix will grow approximately to 40% in fiscal \u201825. We will continue to apply a rigorous process for lease renewals to ensure we are comfortable with the financial return and overall customer experience. Currently, the vast majority of our stores are cash flow positive, and we believe are essential for us to serve our customers. I'll move next to our cash flow and our capital allocation approach. To start with, we have been generating healthy levels of free cash flow for several years, which provides us ample room to fund our growth investments. Our average annual free cash flow over the past five years is more than $2.3 billion. Our capital allocation strategy has been consistent for several years. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive growth, highlighted by the strategies you've heard today. This includes both, capital expenditures and operating expense investments. Next, we may explore additional partnerships and acquisitions if we believe they will accelerate our ability to achieve more profitable growth. We also plan to continue to be a premium dividend payer and return excess cash through share repurchases. Let me quickly expand on a few of these areas. We expect our annual capital expenditures to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the next three years. Earlier, Damien outlined a number of changes to our stores to further our strategy. Consistent with our iterative approach, we will test, learn and deploy once we have vetted anticipated returns of our initiatives. Technology investments are expected to remain similar to fiscal \u201823, simply decreasing as a mix of our capital deployment. This morning, we announced a 26% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share. Our targeted dividend payout remains in the range of 35% to 45% of prior year's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Lastly, this year marked a record level of share repurchases at $3.5 billion. In fiscal \u201823, we plan to spend approximately $1.5 billion on share repurchases. So, with that, let me turn the stage back over Corie. Sure. And maybe just to adjust the overall impact to EBIT next year, we talked about the OI rate being at 5.4% and last year ended at 6%. That decline is mostly coming from our gross profit rate decline. And the majority of that gross profit rate decline has been -- is due to the Totaltech membership rollout. As you know, we launched the membership in Q3 -- at the end of Q3 last year, and we don't cycle that until Q3 of next year, FY23. So, that majority of that gross profit decline is coming from the Totaltech launch, to give you a general size of the impact. Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So essentially, you're right that roughly, as we think about our path to FY25, FY23, we talked about it being down as the industry is assumed to be in the low single digits to mid single digits. As you move to FY25, that would assume a higher pace of growth in those couple of years, not necessarily being linear, but a little higher pace of growth than we have historically. What gives us confidence in the ability to do that is a lot of the initiatives that you heard today. So, we've outlined a number of things, Totaltech changes to our stores, expanding our assortment, growing into Best Buy Health. Those things give us confidence in being able to accelerate our sales as we look out past FY23. What's assumed in that number as well is essentially, we would expect to still modestly gain share on a baseline of our business but then be able to accelerate our share growth with these initiatives that we talked about and then expand our markets with the items that Jason shared and also Best Buy Health as well. Yes. So, what we outlined was a minus 1 to minus 4 comp for FY23. We also talked about how the weight of that decline is in the first half of the year. So, you could assume that something maybe towards the bottom end of that range for -- or a little worse on first half of this year. So, you could imagine any number of outcomes as you look at the back half. Yes. I'm not sure I caught the entirety of the first part of that question. But, in terms of the store four-wall operating rate in the future. We would expect to continue to find efficiencies in our store operating. Damien outlined a number of things that we're doing. It's also important to know that the store is connected to the broadness of how our whole business works from an omnichannel perspective, whether it's the store, our digital presence, our chat or virtual sales that we're now engaging in. So, we're always going to find ways to create efficiencies. Obviously, there are some levels of inflation in fixed costs within our stores that we're always choosing to navigate, but we would expect that there's still opportunities for us to continue to drive a better outcome on the store side from a profitability standpoint. Sure, I can start and then Corie can jump in, too. If I look just outward towards our FY25 goals, we talked about how we'll always need to be price competitive in our business. So, that is fundamental to how our consumers want to interact with us and to the market. And so, we'll always make the right decisions to be price competitive and create value for them. If I think about what happened this last quarter in terms of ASPs and units and transactions and thus last year, on a year-over-year basis, a lot of our growth and most of our growth is coming from ASP increases, which was coming from a couple of different avenues. So, premium mix is up. That's the majority of our ASP increases. Secondly, we have some pricing increases from what we've been seeing from inflation, but the majority is that premium mix. Transactions and traffic were down in the quarter, as you would imagine from a sales -- the sales decline. But it's important to note, too, if you look all the way back into our history, ASPs have been increasing year after year after year. There's an interesting dynamic happening in our organics, which can distort the view of organics in total. We've been seeing actually unit and transaction growth and ASP growth in our higher ASP areas like computing and appliances and televisions. Where we're seeing the unit declines and transaction is on the very low ASP items, things that have been shifting over to the digital mediums like gaming software or music or movies. And so, that's what's creating some of the dynamic on the units and transactions. So, we really like the fact that our units and our ASPs are growing in those areas where we can really create a better experience for our customers in totality. I think, you addressed next year. Next year, I think we don't plan our business based on ASPs and units and transactions. We would continue to expect, though, that as our business shifts and we start -- you see our Totaltech offers and our better experiences start to take hold that our ASP and our premium mix would continue to grow and provide a better solution overall, but also be able to add in some of those lower ASP items as we continue to create a better experience holistically. Sure. The Best Buy Ads business, for now, it's -- most of that's coming through our current vendors. And when that's the case, what it does, it actually drives margin rate is recorded as an offset to cost of sales. So overall, when you take that in addition to the SG&A required to drive it, it does create an OI rate positive experience for us, but it is more of a rate offset in margin. To the extent we drive more sales with people that aren't our vendors and we go outside of our ecosystem, that actually would then show up into revenue in the future. Yes. I'll start and maybe Jason can jump in after that. Compared to FY20, some of our categories actually did start to get close to or back to FY20 levels in Q4. So, there were places we saw more promotionality in Q4 on a year-over-year basis and as it relates back to \u201820 where things like computing, headphones and wearables and even TV started to get back to levels close to FY20. And so that's where we've been seeing some of the more promotions in this last quarter. We actually saw computing start to be more promotional on a yearly basis back in Q3. So, that's where we're starting to see. And you're right, as we look to FY23, we would expect more and more categories to start to return to more normal FY20 levels based on how inventory starts to flow. There are some still inventory things we're watching in terms of the chipsets and some supply constraints. But as inventory starts to normalize and get into next year for more categories, we would expect more of them to return to levels closer to FY20. Yes. We did see some pressure from freight warehousing in Q4. It wasn't as material as some of the other things we've talked about. So, we are seeing higher rates come through just the transportation and carrier mix of what we're having to supply. It was offset a little bit by a parcel reduction. So overall, there was a little bit more pressure in Q4. As you think about next year, we are expecting to see freight warehousing continue to be a pressure as we continue to move through the year, not as material as some other things that we've laid out, but it would be something that we're going to continue to navigate over the next number of quarters. Sure. I'll take that from a couple of different angles, Michael. First, I'd say, over the last couple of years, this team you see on the camera, everyone in the building and the field have been doing amazing job just navigating and accelerating a number of the strategies to lift our business and improve the profitability over the last couple of years managing through the pandemic. There is certainly a number of things we've changed about our operating model that has allowed us to navigate very easily through store channel to an omnichannel to now a virtual channel and the chat situation. So, the team has done an amazing job just finding ways to efficiently operate this business, and that's helping us drive profitability now and as we look forward. And we'll continue to do that. As you look to the out years in terms of profitability, we have been -- we've been talking about investments in areas like health and technology. And now we're talking about investing in our stores. All those things are intended to pay back, not just payback from a sales perspective, but also continue to improve from a rate and an operating dollar and an operating rate perspective as well. So, they are, as we've laid out in our materials, ways we're going to help expand our rate from FY23 up to the range of 6.3% to 6.8% in FY25. We believe those initiatives will help generate more profit -- being more accretive over time. And at the same time, we'll keep working hard to make -- create the efficiencies in our stores and navigate through the different channels very seamlessly. We'll never stop trying to find those improvements. And this team has been hard at work doing that. Yes. Certainly, the ranges we gave from a revenue and OI perspective have those ranges on all the initiatives and various components of our plan. So, we would continue to strive for those targets that we gave for operating rate income, despite maybe coming at the bottom end of that scale. There's obviously a range when come to the initiatives, but also just the work in our baseline or business to create efficiency. So, we would continue to target that even if it was towards the lower end. But obviously, we're going to make the right decisions for the long term. So, we'll always choose to invest as we need to along the way. Yes. So, we haven't given the numbers for FY24. So, obviously, we're giving us up a little bit of flexibility in how we get to the FY25 goals, not just in terms of the lines of P&L, but even the years as well. We would expect to see improvements each year, if you will, the general size is we haven't actually sized for anyone, but we wouldn't expect to see improvements as we progress in each of the years going forward. Yes. We didn't size the -- expanding our assortment within the numbers. We gave some indication for some of the other areas that if you go from the mid-range of FY23 to FY25, that's about $5 billion. Totaltech was $1.5 billion of that number, and that includes the cannibalization of the standalone services and offerings that we have. We also talked about how health is at $525 million today and that we're going to grow at a high CAGR rate over the next number of years that would indicate that by FY25, it's about $900 million of growth, too. So we're breaking those parts out. What's left is what we would expect to expand in our -- from our categories and our physical assets. So, we would expect those to provide some meaningful growth as well as the other items. Sure. So overall, for FY23, we've talked about how the majority of that step back is -- in operating rate is driven by the Totaltech launch that we did in FY22. And so, we cycle that at the end. And so, what's essentially happening is the -- what used to be higher services gross profit rate is now being impacted by the launch of Totaltech, which is a much more complete offer. So, it includes product warranties, installation, things like that. So, the gross -- services gross profit rate is coming down, if you will. What we're doing though is driving more members much faster than we did in our previous service membership and driving more product incremental sales. The standalone offer is actually profitable on its own but we're navigating this period of time where we're cycling a different services offer and also building and scaling the incremental sales of the offer itself. So all that takes some time, and we're not necessarily pointed towards a gross profit rate or an SG&A rate. We're looking at driving OI rate over time and OI rate dollars over time. And so, we haven't given guidance over that period from FY25 because we're obviously going to give our self a little bit of flexibility as we navigate a very new offer in Totaltech as we understand just the incrementality and the frequency, but also just the usage. So, we haven't given those -- the breakouts of the different. We will also expect gross profit expansion in other areas, though. So, health has a very healthy gross profit rate. Best Buy Ads also has the ability to drive gross profit rates. There are things that help us mitigate what might come from a lower services gross profit rate in the future. Yes. We haven't given the -- we're not going to give the exact breakout by initiative. But all of them are contributing to that OI rate expansion from \u201823 to the targets we gave for FY25. There are a lot of moving parts. But each of them, the initiatives of health and Best Buy -- or Totaltech as well as Ads, those are all contributing to the growth in the operating income rate. Not necessarily. The growth in membership is indicative of the value of the offer, the interactions that they want to have with us. And so, we would see membership revenue grow, but also to the extent that members are growing, the incremental product sales that they would grow, would grow with that. So, it wouldn't necessarily impact the pace at which we could actually drive profitability. The holistic? Sorry for the confusion there. Yes, we would assume there are some revenue impact and profitability impact from the broad work on our store portfolio, namely the experiential store rollouts that we're doing. And as we continue to look at the market approach, any other changes, we would include that into the revenue outcome as well. Yes. It's increasingly difficult to look at two years and three-year stacks of growth rates. I think, the best guidance for us would be if you look at the next year's guide of 1% to 4% and think about the first half versus back half. The first half is going to see a bigger weighted sales decline just based on the 37 comp we did in Q1 last year and then the 20 comp in Q2. How that works out exactly -- it won't necessarily be even from a three-year perspective or a two-year perspective. But if you think about a first half, back half for next year is probably the easiest way. And then, think about the overall guide of 1% to 4% and how that -- where they may land in that order. Yes. We didn't quantify it. What we said is we believe we would have been pretty safely in the range of our revenue performance in Q4 if we hadn't had to reduce our store hours and if we had seen the level of inventory in certain products and categories that we were expecting. Some of that wouldn't necessarily be lost because people find that people do come back to us after maybe an attempt that they couldn't or if the product wasn't available. So, it isn't necessarily lost as you look into next year, but we do believe we would have been pretty safely in the range of revenue, had those two factors not happened."

            "name": "Damien Harmon",
            "content": "Thank you, Corie. It's great to be here with you today to talk about our accomplishments and our plans for this year and beyond across our omnichannel portfolio. As Corie mentioned earlier, omnichannel retail is a critical component of our strategic ecosystem. It's the most direct way to connect our strategy to the needs of our customers and employees. Let's look at the last two years before we dive into where we're going. These last two years have challenged our employees in ways we could have never imagined. Powered by our strategic investments, we were able to serve our customers' needs and grow the business. There are two areas I want to highlight. First, the connection between our online sales, which expanded to 34% of our total domestic revenue and the 150% growth we've seen in our virtual interaction across video, chat and voice. Today, 84% of the Best Buy customers use digital channels throughout their shopping journey. These virtual opportunities have created new ways for us to offer customers the immediate ability to shop with an expert wherever they are. Second and also connected to our customers using digital channels throughout their shopping journey is we've seen a 72% growth in customers who are using our app while in our stores. This also creates an opportunity for us to build more digital interactions and technology-related solutions to support their needs. These numbers are amazing. We could not be more proud of our teams and how they deliver. Just as importantly, it gives us an incredible foundation for continued growth and optimism as we look to the future. Now from an omnichannel perspective, we look at the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. The two main drivers of that and what I'm going to talk about today are how we optimize our workforce and reimagine our physical presence in ways that serve our customers' needs in an ever-growing digital world. Our focus is on further developing our teammates to give them the skills to help customers inside and outside of our stores, but more importantly, through any number of digital channels that at our customers' fingertips. At the same time, we will optimize our store portfolio. And as Matt mentioned, we will maintain the trend of closing 20 to 30 stores per year. However, with online penetration growing so rapidly in the last two years, we're making investments in our stores to provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as customers move from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home. So, I'll start with our people. We have significantly improved efficiency and productivity of our store labor model. We've seen a more than 100 basis-point improvement in store domestic labor expense as a percentage of revenue compared to FY20. We've also materially increased store productivity over the past two years. We've done this by reskilling our teammates and making investments that lean into physical and digital shopping experience. A few examples include our fulfillment improvements, consultation labor and our virtual store. This allows us to leverage our employees more effectively inside and outside of our stores. The great news is that as we've made these adjustments, we've maintained a strong NPS in our stores. These investments in our people have allowed us to help them learn new skills, grow their careers, gain flexibility and realize their dream by keeping them with us longer. We've increased our average wage rate 20% in the last two years by raising our minimum wage to $15 an hour and shifting some of our employees into higher skilled, higher paying roles. In fact, our average wage for our field employees this year will be over $18 an hour. Since we started our flexible workforce initiative in 2020, 80% of our talented associates are now skilled to support multiple jobs inside and outside of our stores. And we're proud of the fact that our fill turnover rates remain significantly below retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates. Overall, we're in a place we like right now. We're becoming more efficient without losing sight of delivering amazing experiences for our customers and our employees. We're going to continue to strike the balance between spend and productivity as we look at the factors that I just outlined. Now, an obvious differentiator for our workforce is our Geek Squad team, which continues to deliver an experience that creates repeat customers. We have nearly 21 million services interactions across in-store and in-home services. We've significantly expanded our repair capabilities in categories that are important to customers [Technical Difficulty] helped us produce fantastic NPS results in-store, in-home and through our remote support. And after we complete the repairs, customer spend one times more [Technical Difficulty]. In fact 35% of our mobile phone customers are new or reengaged with Best Buy. This is enabled by a technical workforce that has an average tenure of almost nine years and a retention rate an 86%, no-one can match that level of expertise at the scale we can. That's huge. That team here has helped us produce fantastic NPS results. In-store, in home, and remote areas, customer spend 1.7 times more and engage 1.6 times more often across all Geek Squad services. Geek Squad will be a viral part of our Totaltech initiative, and we'll continue to offer standalone services that matter to customers, deepen those relationships and drive frequency. Our customers are also leveraging our expertise through consultations as well, both inside and outside of our stores. These consultations provide a direct access to customers for an ever-growing set of experts. Employees who have the skill sets to complete a consultation has grown by 78% last year. And with each consultation, we can inspire what's possible. Customers spend 17% more across their lifetime value, and they purchase more often when engaged for a consultation. Customers are loving this experience, and we're seeing strong NPS. When surveyed, 92% of customers say they will likely continue working our expert. And when customers engage with one of our consultations or designers, they shop with Best Buy 2 times more frequently. So looking ahead, we believe our annual consultations will grow by more than 200% by fiscal \u201825. As you saw earlier, we had 45 million virtual interactions across all channels, creating opportunities to engage our customers differently. We're excited about our virtual store, which just launched last fall. To date, our virtual store in comparison to historical chat experiences is generating higher close rate, higher sales and a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction. And that's not all. Our vendors are extremely excited about it as well. We started with 17 vendors on board, and we will end fiscal \u201823 with over 60 vendors investing in our virtual store. This is an investment in us and the belief that we're creating a totally differentiating experience. We're expanding our virtual store and adding more categories like appliances and home theater. And we expect our virtual sales interactions to double by fiscal \u201825. So, let's talk about ways we are reimagining our store in support of our physical and digital shopping experiences. We are very excited about the things that we're testing, learning, in some cases, implementing in our stores. First, let's talk about experiential store. In 2020, we launched a test in one of our Houston stores and added two additional locations since then. Some of the key enhancements include dedicated showcase spaces for some of the new categories Jason mentioned earlier, like e-transportation, outdoor living, fitness. We expanded our Microsoft and Apple shops and dedicated more space to premium experiences like appliances, home theater and audio. We expanded our Geek Squad presence for more customer interactions and space for repair services. And we've also enhanced the fulfillment capabilities to include exterior lockers, additional space with shipping, packing and fulfilling from our store warehouses. And we're excited about the performance. We've seen a 370 basis-point improvement in NPS. We've seen a steady lift in customer penetration in the retail trade area as well as overall customer spend. And we expect to continue to see strong revenue lift in these experiential stores, and we will remodel 50 locations in fiscal \u201823 and about 300 locations expected by fiscal \u201825. Now, I want to highlight our 16 outlet stores that are open-box clearance, end of life and otherwise distressed large product inventory across major appliances and televisions, which might otherwise be liquidated at a significant lower recovery rate. These outlets unlock value by alleviating space and capacity from our core stores, and they are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in the landfill. In FY22, gross liquidation recovery rate is almost 2 times higher than alternative channels. These locations are attracting new and reengaged customers. 16% of customers are new and 37% of customers are reengaged. In FY23, we will double the amount of outlet stores, and we'll test expanding our assortments by adding computing, gaming and mobile phones. As we discussed last year, we launched a test in Charlotte of a new holistic market approach. And as I mentioned earlier, the ways people are shopping today are entirely different than how they shopped two years ago, and our stores and the way they operate need to change and adjust accordingly. This work in Charlotte is a manifestation of this shopping evolution, and this pilot leverages all of our assets in a full portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlets, consultation labor, and we bring it all together with our digital app. Within the test, we are looking at how a variety of store formats across 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square feet locations can serve customers' needs. And this summer, we will be introducing a 5,000 square-foot store into the marketplace. When you look at the before and after map of the Charlotte market, you can see we have reduced our overall square footage by 5% and yet we've increased our customer coverage in the marketplace from 76% to 85%. We've also added 260 access points, where customers can get their gear and employee delivery covers nearly half of the metro. So looking ahead, we'll be focusing on using this market to learn in fiscal \u201823 before we make decisions on what to scale or what not to. Technology enhancements are at the center of many of the changes I just mentioned, from self-checkout to virtual store, technology supporting our teams and customers in new and exciting ways. Take a look at this video to see what we're doing. [Audio/Video Presentation] As we can see, technology brings it all together in support of our optimized workforce and how our physical locations will enhance the shopping experience inside and outside of our stores. We're excited about this year and our future as we focus on the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. Now, I'd like to turn it over to our President of Best Buy Health, Deborah Di Sanzo. The only thing I would add is, traditionally, we've looked at one store at a time and how that particular store can create an experience for a customer. Now, you're looking at the full portfolio, all of our assets in a particular geography, and you're finding ways to be able to navigate that customer experience and what they're expecting across a multitude of different experiences. I think, that's what's really important is, we've never done that before because it's been in each individual store. Now being able to say across a 15,000 or 25,000 or a 35,000 square-foot store in an outlet experience and our consultation labor, we can take care of that customers' needs across the board, and our teams are working across the stores. Our teams are working across different customer expectations and really delivering a unique experience in that marketplace. And we're continuing to learn over time, and then we'll apply that as we see what's working best for us or what's not."

            "name": "Jason Bonfig",
            "content": "Thanks, Corie. Good morning. We continue to lead the tech industry with significant high-share and high-consideration categories. What I mean by a high-consideration category, generally higher ASPs in a longer period of time from when you start to think about purchasing to when you actually purchase. Continuing to grow our share in these large categories like televisions and computing will always be a cornerstone of our strategy. But to be truly there for our customers and all their technology needs, we need to accelerate our share across other areas of technology as well and also some new spaces. This is where Totaltech comes in. Products with lower ASPs and shorter upgrade and consideration cycles, our share is generally lower. Totaltech creates a new value proposition that benefits customers when they consolidate their technology shopping at Best Buy. I want to give three examples of a customer journey that illustrate this point. Let's start with a customer that actually wants to upgrade their kitchen. They want to buy an entirely new kitchen suite with three pieces. That customer that has Totaltech does not have to worry about delivery and install. It's included in the price. That could be between $400 and $500 value. A little bit later in the year, the same customer hypothetically breaks their phone. They want to get a new iPhone. When they purchase that iPhone at Best Buy, AppleCare is included. Just in the first year, that's just under $120 of value. Then a little bit later in the year, they want to get a new pair of wireless headphones. If you purchase those headphones at Best Buy, the warranty is also included and you're a Totaltech member. That's a $30 value. Examples like these is where Totaltech benefits come to life for our customers and create a reason to make a considered visit to our app, our website, our store, and increases Best Buy share across all of the categories on the slide behind me. Technology innovation never stops. And even when you look over the past three years, you can see value of the new technology and what it creates for our customers. During the pandemic, the majority of the focus was around creating products to meet customer demand. This was a distraction, but even with that, there was significant innovation and value created by our vendors. The slide behind me highlights an upgrade over a three-year period of similar price points across laptops and televisions. While I won't hit on every new feature and advancement that happened, I'll highlight a few. For televisions, you get a full 10 inches more in screen size, almost no bezel and the ability to navigate your TV with voice, if you'd like to. On the laptop side, you can log in with your face. It's faster, thinner, lighter and has significantly longer battery life. These continued evolutionary innovation cycles are never ending, and they drive growth. They create reasons to upgrade and unlock new and better experiences for our customers each and every year. In fact, when we look at our customers' behavior, we're seeing a 7% to 15% reduction in the amount of time it takes a customer to get back into a category. They're coming back to categories faster because of these innovations by our vendors. I've highlighted how Totaltech and our vendor innovations will drive growth. Now, I'd like to highlight some macro trends that will also drive opportunities in our business. I'll start with 5G and fiber. The expansion of speed and networks in general are really, really good for customers and technology. You can download a movie in minutes, collaborate with others instantly, excess a video game or video content anywhere you want without latency. These are things that will drive new experiences and growth for our customers. The next trend is the metaverse and cloud, have virtual experiences, play golf with friends or family members virtually, travel to places that you actually can't and have a full experience in the virtual world. In addition to that, when you look at the virtual world and cloud, there are new experiences that are created. Previously, you could just play a game on a gaming system and your television. Now you can take that same game seamlessly from the system, to your phone, to your tablet. In fact, if some of you have children like I do, you're constantly battling the ability for them to play anywhere they want, anytime they want. The cloud also solves significant customer pain points. Previously, our customers would tell us when they wanted to upgrade a computing product, it would take them 60 minutes to get it the exact way they'd want to. That would be moving their icons, their data, just getting it the way the old one was and having the features of the new. Today, with cloud, you're simply putting your credentials and in 10 to 15 minutes, it's actually exactly the way you want. You get all the benefits of the new technology and you get all of the placement and all the setup of your old product instantly. That does drive upgrade and it drives interest in customers in upgrading more frequently. The next trend I'd like to talk about is automation and support. The connected home has been around for years, and it's now moving into automation and support more specifically. Single-function devices like robot vacuums today, tomorrow, they'll move into security of the entire home, communication and assistance for individuals. This is very, very important as our population ages and people want to stay in their homes longer. Automation and support is one of the ways where technology can enable people to just do that and accomplish their goals and solve that pain point. Next, I'd like to talk about customization and personalization. Customers have always wanted to express themselves, and technology is not excluded from that. But there has been significant advancement in manufacturing from appliances to cell phones where customers can express themselves with a touch of color, a family photo or any other type of personal expression that they'd like to integrate into the products. Sustainability is also a significant trend that's important to customers, but also very important to Best Buy. I'll start with a vendor example. Samsung televisions that we sell in our stores today have what is called Samsung solar cell technology in their remote controls. This eliminates the need for batteries, which is obviously very beneficial to the environment, but it also charges off of not only solar, but ambient light in the home. And it means that you're never going to have a remote that's out of power. That solves a significant customer pain point. Technology like this will expand to more and more categories and drive upgrade cycles. In addition to that, we want to make sure that we're supporting customers that want to upgrade more frequently. Today, you see that come to life with our recycling and trade-in programs, which are a very important part of our value proposition to customers. Over time, that will start to move into new usage models that may actually be upfront conversations about exactly how long a customer wants to use a product, and when that next upgrade will happen? Will it be a year? Will it be two years, or will it be three years as we move forward? Let's watch the video highlighting many of the areas I've talked about and even some new additional areas that will drive growth. [Audio/Video Presentation] I'd like to thank our friends at Samsung for that assist in that demo. As we look over the past decade, we've had over $12 billion in sales growth with the vast majority coming from large categories like TVs, computing and appliances, and one-third coming from new categories like wearables and VR, just to name a few. As we move forward, that innovation will continue and there will continue to be new categories that don't even exist today. We're also looking to accelerate that expansion by entering new categories that are aligned with where our customers want us to be in places where Best Buy can solve real customer pain points. For the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to focus on these five areas of expansion. I'll go a bit deeper on three of these: fitness and wellness, outdoor living and personal electric transportation, in the next few minutes. I'll start with fitness and wellness. This is a $34 billion industry that we are uniquely positioned to compete in with our blue shirts, but also our large product fulfillment network that was built for televisions and appliances. Our assortment has grown by 650% in the last 12 months, and we are implementing a larger, more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months with dedicated zones for vendors. Damien will touch on the virtual store a little bit later, but customers today actually have the ability to have a virtual chat or video consultation with a fitness expert. The next area I'd like to talk about is personal electric transportation. This is a $3 billion industry with rapid growth. We've introduced 250 new products this holiday with 500 additional accessories around those products. We'll be adding physical assortment to 900 stores and a more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months. We currently offer assembly, and we're in the pilot stages of service and support and repair for our customers. The last category I'd like to highlight is outdoor living. This is over a $30 billion industry, and our acquisition of Yardbird, a leading premium outdoor furniture company, provides the ability for us to accelerate this business across a nationwide network. That acquisition, combined with our strength in outdoor television and audio, and new partnerships with leading brands like Traeger, Weber and Bromic, create a comprehensive solution for our customers. When we couple that assortment with our home consultants, and the physical and digital experiences that we've developed for customers, this is a really, really fast-moving category that has the ability to grow. You'll start to see Yardbird products as fast as this spring in Southern California market, and we're very excited about that. To reiterate, we expect growth from Totaltech, consistent innovation from our vendors, macro trends that I've mentioned, new product categories that we don't even know about yet and five new areas of expansion to move our business forward. Thank you. I'll hand it back to you, Corie. Thanks for the question. 5G, I think you're going to continue to see happen at more of a market level. So, it will be almost a rolling change as it hits the individual markets and the potential for that additional speed is unlocked with customers. That shows up not only in products, but it also just shows up in the ability to make more connected products, the expansion into things like tablets, watches, laptops to really take advantage of that faster connection. The other area is metaverse is very, very much alive, and we're seeing the trends with our customers. When we look at VR, our VR business grew double year-over-year in Q4, but actually also for the entire fiscal year of FY22, showing the customer interest in wanting to experience the metaverse, want to try some of the different things from a virtual reality perspective. And the amount of products and the amount of customers just will continue to evolve as they find more and more ways to take advantage of the technology that's going to just continue to expand experiences for customers and the ability to plug into these new networks and new experiences as we move forward."

            "name": "Deborah Di Sanzo",
            "content": "Thank you, Damien. Here is the ecosystem slide Corie and Damien shared, and it's a perfect introduction to Best Buy Health as our work is an excellent example of the Best Buy ecosystem and flywheel. Today, I will share the strategy of health at Best Buy. But first, let's see it come to life in this video. [Audio/Video Presentation] I hope the video begins to answer the question that I hear often, \u201cWhy in the world is Best Buy in health?\u201d I understand the question because health is complex. It has a longer return on investment, and other companies have not succeeded. So why will Best Buy succeed? We didn't build this strategy to be like any other company or to change who Best Buy is. We built our strategy on Best Buy strengths, our world-class omnichannel, distribution and logistics, strong analytics, presence in the home and our empathetic caring center agents. Our strategy is supported by the rapid consumerization of health and two significant trends. First, Technology is moving into health. We recognize an $80 billion market opportunity for health technology and the desire for consumers to use technology to manage their health. And second, health is moving into the home. By 2025, an estimated $265 billion in Medicare services will move into the home, and 61% of patients say they would choose hospital care at home. And Best Buy has long proven we're a trusted advisor for technology in the home. 70% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Best Buy store, able to shop health and wellness products, speak with our expert blue shirts and utilize our distribution hubs to fulfill their health technology needs. Geek Squad makes 9 million home visits annually, helping consumers set up technology and perhaps more importantly, teaching them how to use it. And we have the confidence of our customers and partners as we work to help enhance the health industry. Our strategy is to enable care at home, building on the strengths in three focal areas. In consumer health, we provide curated health and wellness products; in active aging, we offer health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home; in virtual care, we connect patients with their physicians and enable care at home. Our presence in each of these focal areas creates a flywheel where growth in one adds momentum to the other two. This is the strength of our story. Now, let us look at the customer journey. Jason touched on a few areas of consumer health earlier and our video introduced you to Angela, a 45-year-old mother and caregiver to an aging father. You saw her purchase a TytoCare home medical kit when her son was sick. And Angela can find countless other products to support the health of her family from weighted blankets to exercise equipment to blood pressure cuffs and more. These products not only support our customers and their day-to-day health but also serve as an entry to our other two focal areas, active aging and virtual care. Lively supports adults who want to age independently at home. Our easy-to-use phones and personal emergency response devices feature one touch access to our caring center and services like urgent response, fall detection and more, providing patients and caregivers with a peace of mind that care is only a call away. Last year, we launched our new Lively brand and a Lively partnership with Apple to feature our health and safety services on Apple Watch. And today, I'm happy to announce Lively on Alexa, which will launch this spring. Our Lively monthly subscription service provides a consistent revenue stream. And last year, we drove 15% year-over-year growth by adding 348,000 new lives served. Our caring center agents connected with our customers over 9 million times last year, offering a variety of health and safety services. So, let's jump back to Angela's story. Angela worries about her father living at home alone, so she purchases a Lively smartphone and an Amazon Echo for her dad from Best Buy, along with a monthly Lively health and safety subscription plan. Jacob uses his Lively Smart to request to lift drive to a doctor's office through a caring center agent. He has a minor fall at home and uses his Amazon Echo to alert the caring center, who can follow protocol to determine if emergency medical services are needed. And this patient journey is just one example of the many ways Lively supports active aging adults at home. Now let's look at virtual care. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps the most exciting opportunity lies within virtual care, where we enable patients to connect with their care teams. In November, we acquired Current Health. Current Health is making inroads into care at home through securing strong partnership -- strong partnerships with successful programs at Baptist Health, Mount Sinai, AbbVie, the Defense Health Agency and more. Our acquisition merges Current Health's FDA-cleared at home platform with Best Buy's scale, expertise and connection to the home. Together, we create a powerful virtual care experience. Jacob is in the hospital with [indiscernible]. The hospital physician identifies and enrolls Jacob into the hospital's hospital-at-home program. Best Buy sets up Jacob's home with the technology needed for remote patient monitoring and trains both, Jacob and Angela on how to use it. This ensures the hospital physician can focus on treating patients rather than being a tech consultant. This is a job that physicians had to play during the pandemic, and it overtaxed our health system. At home, Jacob is monitored by Current Health's platform and a virtual command center. The hospital physician checks in daily with video visits to ensure he's healing on track. The command center coordinates Jacob's home medications and notices a lack of data from his monitor. After discovering that he's improperly wearing the device, Geek Squad is deployed to a system. The platform's algorithm alerts the command center that Jacob has a persistent fever and the on-call health system physician prescribes therapeutic, which is delivered by the pharmacy partner. When Jacob recovers, the hospital physician discharges Jacob, and Jacob continues to be supported by Lively. A few of the pieces in this patient journey are still in development. The Geek Squad integrated with Current Health, for example, but this is our direction. And you can see Best Buy is there for the patient with technology, support and connections to enable care at home. And we're not building this alone. We're creating an ecosystem to support consumers and their care-at-home journey. Consumers are at the heart of our strategy, and throughout a lifetime of health needs, Best Buy is there to help enrich and save lives through technology and meaningful connections. As I mentioned earlier, our health opportunity creates a flywheel, driving growth in all three focal areas. Our revenue in fiscal year \u201822 was $525 million. We're growing 35% to 45% a year, and we are accretive in fiscal year \u201827 as the health industry has a longer return on investment. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back to Matt. Corie, I think you pretty much covered most of it. I think I would just say, in the active aging space, we -- people will continue to actively age in their home, live independently in their home. If you think about it, we target -- consumers are 65 years and older, and these consumers like -- actually, they like a physical store experience. So, that in the past couple of years, when our stores were closed, we couldn't go in. We couldn't see the phones. We couldn't see the personal emergency response devices. We really saw that pick up, though, in Q4 of this year. So, we are very optimistic about that market. And I just want to emphasize what Corie said, again, really in the pandemic, consumers thoughts of digital health changed dramatically. In the health technology space for about a decade, people have been talking about the consumerization of healthcare, but the pandemic really brought the consumerization of health care. So, now consumers want to take care of themselves and their family in their home 365 days a year. They do it with technology, and they need help with that technology. And I think that with Best Buy enabling them to connect with their physician, helping them with their technology is really what's driving our optimism in the market. Scot, thank you. Thanks so much. I'll take that. So, think about it this way. First of all, the health presentation that we presented today is a bit different than the strategy that you saw previously. So, this is really one strategic area, three focal points,, taking advantage of the rapid consumerization of healthcare, which did really not exist before two years ago. Second, we continue with active aging. People still do want to live healthy and happy and independently in their homes. And the third area of virtual care is also an era which essentially did not exist before the pandemic. Now hospitals want to have hospital home programs. They want to take care of helping people get better in their homes where they are surrounded by loved ones and feel comfortable. And so, hospitals all over the country are really putting in hospital at home programs, putting in chronic disease management programs. These are growth areas that did not exist before. Our focus before was in active aging. And as I said in my prior remarks, those are consumers 65 years and older and for our products, so the active aging products, they really appreciated a physical store experience. And so, when we had different hours in the last 21 months, when we had some store closures, it did impact the active aging business. But we see it now really -- we had a very strong Q4, and we see that continuing."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Thank you so much, Mollie. Good morning, everyone. We are so pleased you could join us today as we report our fiscal \u201822 results and take this opportunity to update our longer-term strategy and our multiyear financial outlook. Today, we will discuss how our business has evolved and how we are planning to drive value over the next few years. We're not planning to cover all our initiatives or all our business units. We've tried to be as succinct as possible to focus on the topics and initiatives that we believe are most important for you to understand about our business, our plans and where we believe we're headed, both for fiscal \u201823 and for the longer term. First, let's discuss our fiscal \u201822 results. Fiscal \u201822 was another record year. In addition to record revenue and earnings, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things in the face of unprecedented challenge and change to support our customers' technology needs in knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. As we discussed when we entered the year, we anchored on three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that were and are shaping our strategic priorities and investments. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while still providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is a need and is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. With these concepts in mind, we piloted numerous store formats to test and learn in the past year. We advanced our flexible workforce initiatives and invested in our employees' well-being. We introduced new technology tools designed to support both, our customers and also our employees. And we also launched a bold new membership program called Best Buy Totaltech designed to significantly elevate our customer experience and drive incremental sales. We will be talking more about all these topics today. All of this was against a constantly evolving backdrop. During the year, we navigated supply chain and transportation challenges, uncertainty as virus peaks rolled across the country, and then most recently, the disruption from the Omicron wave. Our teams did an amazing job against that backdrop, expertly managing supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic to bring in products our customers needed. During the year, we continued serving our customers digitally at much higher rates. Our online revenue was 34% of our domestic revenue. And while it declined versus last year, it was up 115% or $8.8 billion compared to two years ago. At the same time, we also reached our fastest package delivery speeds ever. We are an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. In fact, the percent of online orders we delivered in one day was twice as high as pre-pandemic levels, despite the significant increase in volume during that same timeframe. These record results are driven by the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology, many of which we discussed at our investor updates, both in 2017 and 2019. More importantly, these results are driven by our amazing associates across the Company. Over the past 24 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for our customers, and they worked tirelessly to provide excellent service. In fact, despite all the changes we went through in the last year, we delivered NPS improvements, both online and in our stores. I'm truly grateful for and continue to be impressed by our associates' dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. From a financial perspective, we delivered record revenue and earnings per share. Our comparable sales growth was 10.4% on top of a very strong 9.7% last year, growing $8 billion over the past two years. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was just over $10, up 27% compared to last year. And compared to two years ago, we expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 110 basis points. Our non-GAAP return on investment improved 840 basis points compared to two years ago, and we drove more than $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the last two years. In fiscal \u201822, we returned $4.2 billion of that to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to deepen our commitment to the community and the environment. Many of you may have had the opportunity to view the video that was playing before the event started. We continue to believe that our ESG efforts are directly tied to long-term value creation, and I am proud of all our initiatives, but we only have time for me to cover a few examples today. We committed to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase by BIPOC representation in the tech industry. We also committed to opening 100 Teen Tech Centers by fiscal \u201825. During fiscal \u201822, we opened 9 to end the year with a total of 44. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. In addition, we're building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. In terms of the environment, in fiscal \u201822, we were a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative, committing to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. We are also driving sustainability through the unique consumer electronics circular economy. We help keep devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek Squad repair services, responsible recycling and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth, and we are honored to be recognized for our work. Notably, we are placed in the top 5 on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list for the past five years in a row. This ranking recognizes our strong performance across all aspects of ESG. In addition, we are on the CDP Climate A List for the fifth year, which recognizes leadership in making a positive impact on the environment. Now, let's move on to our Q4 results. I am extremely proud of what we accomplished during the fourth quarter. Our team showed remarkable execution and dedication to serving our customers throughout the important gift-giving season. This was evidenced by the fact that we drove improvement in year-over-year customer NPS metrics across almost all areas, particularly for in-store, online and chat experiences. In fact, we saw our best-ever customer satisfaction scores for our in-store pickup experience. Online sales were almost 40% of domestic revenue compared to 43% last year and 25% in Q4 of fiscal \u201820. We reached our fastest holiday delivery times ever, shipping products to customer homes more than 25% faster than last year and two years ago. We also completed the purchase of two companies that aligned with our strategy, which Jason and Deborah will talk about later this morning. We are deliberately investing in our future and furthering our competitive differentiation. This, as we expected, is temporarily impacting our profitability. The biggest areas of investment in Q4 were our new membership program, technology and Best Buy Health, all core to our future growth potential. In the face of unexpected change, I remain inspired by the way our teams across the enterprise remain flexible to ensure our customers were able to find the perfect gift. We remain well-positioned as we head into fiscal \u201823 as the unique technology provider for the home. I'll turn the meeting over to Matt to cover more details on our Q4 results and fiscal \u201823 outlook. Matt? Thank you so much, Matt. As I noted closing out my Q4 summary, we remain well-positioned as we head into fiscal \u201823. I'd like to expand on this a bit as we highlight our strategic positioning. There are three key points you should take away from this morning. First, technology is a necessity, and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. Second, we have built an ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences no one else can. And third, we believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time. We believe we have the right strategy to deliver growth and value for all stakeholders. And we are excited to go into more detail about our plans. But first, let's do some level setting. Our purpose is unchanged and more relevant today this minute than ever. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is enduring, and we have honed our five-year vision. We personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. Technology is no longer a nice to have, it is a necessity, and it is expanding into all parts of our lives and homes. Working has forever changed. Streaming content has exponentially grown. The metaverse is coming to life. We can power our homes with connected solar panels. Cars are connected. And we can monitor our health, including connecting with the physician from our living room. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology. And we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers' homes right for their lives. For example, we will send a consultant to your home for free to optimize the tech you have or have the tech you want. We can repair your phone screen and you can try VR headsets while you wait. You can meet with a fitness consultant in our virtual store, who will match your fitness goals with our fitness products, or you can use our Lively device to connect with a carrying center agent, who can help you schedule a lift. These are just some examples, and you'll see this come to life in many more ways throughout our presentation this morning. From a financial perspective, we delivered remarkable results over the past two years, and we are far ahead of where we expected to be when we set our long-term financial targets back in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, in the past two years, we have delivered more than $8 billion of revenue growth and improved our operating income rate by 110 basis points to 6%. We are in a strong position to drive the business forward and deliver growth. We do not, for one minute, believe we hit our peak revenue and margin this past year. As Matt outlined, we do expect fiscal \u201823 to look different as the industry cycles the last two years of unusually strong demand. And we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. But in fiscal \u201825, we expect to deliver revenue growth and expand our operating income rate beyond what we reported in fiscal \u201822. As we have always said, in order to deliver these financial results, it is paramount that we stay focused on our goal to remain a best place to work and we continue to deepen relationships with our customers. As you can see, our new fiscal \u201825 targets are materially higher than what we thought just back in 2019. We now expect to generate approximately $1 billion more in operating income than our original targets. Given our margin rate, this is considerable growth in operating income. So, what's changed since 2019? Well, the CE industry is larger than we expected. Our online mix has nearly doubled. We have found ways to make our operating model more flexible and efficient while also investing in wages and benefits. We are accelerating our category expansion. And we have launched an entirely new membership program. On the flip side, the financial contribution from Best Buy Health is clearer, but also a bit longer term than we had originally modeled. This is based on primarily two things. First, demand in active aging business and product constraints were impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, based on our internal learnings and insights from consumer behavior changes over the past two years, we tuned our strategy to focus on the growing virtual care opportunity, which Deborah will discuss in more detail later. As we think about our strategy going forward, it is important to look at how dramatically our business has evolved over the past several years. Here, we use fiscal \u201815 to give a longer-term view to what a different business we have become. Most of these changes were already in motion before the pandemic and then accelerated significantly in the past two years. Let me expand on a few points here. I already mentioned our fiscal \u201822 online business was 34% of our domestic sales. That is more than $16 billion in sales compared to just $3.5 billion in fiscal \u201815. When you look at how we use our stores for fulfillment, the increase in the sheer number of products customers are picking up in our stores is impressive. This is even more meaningful, when you consider the fact that our delivery speed is industry-leading, and we cut the delivery speed essentially in half over the past several years. Clearly, customers value our stores and the convenience and choice they provide. As Damien is going to discuss, we are increasingly interacting with customers via digital channels, like chat and video and in their homes. And finally, membership is incredibly important, both now and into our future. Our Totaltech membership is a big theme of today's presentation. But don't lose sight of the fact that we were a pioneer in loyalty programs. And our My Best Buy program now has more than 100 million total members. So, with all of that as background, I'd like to tap back to our first key takeaway. Technology is a necessity, and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. So, let's start with some industry context. The traditional CE industry is large and growing. There is no perfect external source that tracks our business. So here, we're showing a historical view based on selected government PCE category data. Our outlook is based on multiple industry forecasts and internal data. As you can see on this chart, the industry was growing for several years and then accelerated during the last two years. As Matt mentioned, we expect it to step back this year as the industry absorbs the very high growth of the past two years. By fiscal \u201825, we believe it can be back to fiscal \u201822 levels, which is materially higher than it was pre pandemic. In addition, we're expanding our addressable market by entering new categories in areas like health and electric bikes that are being disrupted by technology in a good way as well as areas where we can really complete solutions for customers, like indoor and outdoor living. Jason will provide a bit more detail on these in a few minutes. As a reminder, this is also a stable industry. Contrary to some sentiment, technology is no more volatile or cyclical than other large durable goods categories over time. And the last two years have significantly underscored the importance of technology in day-to-day life. What historically was seen as a want has become a need. 40% of Americans use digital technology or the Internet in new or different ways compared with before the pandemic. And the use of telemedicine is triple what it was in just Q1 of 2020. The majority of people who started or increased activities like online fitness, telemedicine, videoconferencing and connecting socially with others virtually say they plan to continue this increased usage even after the pandemic. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before, and they're also more tech connected than they ever have been before. As a result, there is an overall larger installed base of consumers using technology. People own more tech devices than ever before. This combination of more devices and more activities also means customers need their tech to work seamlessly every day. True tech support when the customer wants it underpins living this way and is our unique asset across all these devices. And technology is extending in all aspects of our home, and we've all grown to depend on it. This is not a hit-driven category. It is an industry that is need-based, stable and has been growing. We firmly believe people will continue to use technology more and both need and want to replace or upgrade their products. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely some we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant. And that innovation drives interest, upgrades and experimentation into the future. This is not a static industry. So, to talk about this exciting world of technology innovation, I'm honored to welcome Jason Bonfig, our Chief Merchandising Officer. Thanks so much, Jason. Obviously, you are the expert. Back to our second key takeaway. We have built a unique ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences that no one else can. Consumer electronics is a distinctive industry. The products are constantly evolving. They're connected to networks that are constantly evolving. They all use different operating systems, and they range from small and powerful to large and breakable, often at high price points. And customers are more comfortable using tech than they have ever been yet. They also admit it's likely not doing all it could to make their lives better. Against that backdrop, we have built a unique ecosystem of assets that all work together to create a stickier and more valuable relationship with the customer. And we're investing in this ecosystem as we pivot against a backdrop of even higher customer expectations. We'll provide more depth on a number of these assets through the rest of the presentation. So, anchoring this ecosystem is our expert advice and service. Customers are excited about tech and want to be confident in their purchase. We provide that in ways literally no one else can, from our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn't working the way you want or trade in the recycling when you want to upgrade. And then building on that strength, our Totaltech membership ties these experiences together and provides unique benefits that customers value and no one else can provide. We then combine those unique experiences with our strength in omnichannel retailing, industry-leading and seamless shopping experiences and services across all channels, including in-home, in-store, digitally, remotely and virtually. And finally, all these interactions provide us rich data and insights across customer experiences to create personalized technology solution tailored to the customer-specific technology and needs. And all this data fuels our business, like Best Buy Ads, matching our partners' marketing to the most appropriate audiences based on our first-party data. When this ecosystem works together, it provides a unique experience tailored to the customer. It also reaches beyond our consumers into business partners, suppliers and other strategic relationships that leverage our capabilities. Whether it's our consultative services highlighted on partners' websites or vendors leveraging our in-store pickup to fulfill from their websites, others value our capabilities. So, let me add some color around the first part of the ecosystem. As I said, customers are excited about tech and want to be confident with their purchase, particularly when it's part of their daily life at home. So, instead of me trying to describe all the parts and pieces to you, I think this video does an excellent job bringing to life the unique ways we provide expert advice and services, seamlessly across all our touch points. [Audio/Video Presentation] So again, just to reinforce, there is no one else that can provide this type of immersive experience at scale in a world where more and more of our lives are being lived in a way that requires technology. And we felt it was important to double down on our unique capabilities with an equally unique membership offer. This represents literally years of customer research and innovation and truly puts the customer at the center of our investments. Matt talked earlier about the financial implications of our new membership program. Now, I get to talk about the fun part. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. Matt and Jason already mentioned some of the benefits. But as a reminder, Totaltech includes product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, extended warranties on products and much more. Because the membership is so comprehensive, it has broad appeal among our customers. There is truly something for everyone. And the benefit that's most appealing can vary based on a customer's unique shopping journey or their stage in life. So, let me share some early examples. I say early because as a reminder, we literally just rolled this program nationally in mid-October. The benefits associated with purchasing products like product warranty and member pricing are being leveraged the most. Younger generations are using these benefits, especially AppleCare at a higher rate than older generations. This is exciting and important, as extended warranties as a stand-alone business was definitely not a growing part of our business or strategy. And additionally, it's exciting that our employees have embraced this offer, realizing the suite of benefits means there is something in it for every customer. This makes for a more comfortable and natural sales environment and allows the employees to truly focus on the customers' needs. The VIP access to phone and chat support and access to Geek Squad support and services in general are used more often by older generations, which are legacy plans over-indexed on. And the access to hard-to-get inventory is resonating with some of our most engaged customers who already interact and spend with us very frequently. That broad appeal is one of the main reasons we rolled out this program. We have significantly elevated the customer experience by packaging up unique benefits our customers value that no one else can provide. And by doing so, we believe we have made it inconceivable for them to purchase their tech anywhere else. From a business perspective, of course, the goal is to increase customer frequency and capture a larger share of CE spend. As a specialty retailer, our customer frequency has a different profile than mass merchants. As a result, it is even more crucial that we stay in the consideration set as customers are building out their technology solutions. I am incredibly happy to say that we are indeed seeing increased interactions with our Totaltech customers to the tune of about 60%. Also, when we look at NPS surveys, specifically from customers who are Totaltech members, they are running about 1,400 basis points higher than nonmembers. From a spend perspective, it's difficult to calculate with precision, given the early stage of membership and our historical customer frequency. But we currently believe customers who sign up for the membership are spending about 20% more than they would have if they did not have the membership. We already have 4.6 million members. Now to be transparent, we auto converted 3.7 million Totaltech support and other legacy support programs. We have actively enrolled more than 1 million members since launching nationwide in October. And we see a path to double the number of members by the end of fiscal \u201825. This membership program is a vital addition to our customer relationship ecosystem, providing an offer that no one else can and interaction data that is incredibly valuable to all aspects of our business, fueling our growth over time. And to deliver this offer seamlessly, we leverage another part of our ecosystem, omnichannel retailing strength. To provide more depth on the evolution of our omnichannel retailing model, I am pleased to welcome Damien Harmon, our EVP Omnichannel, to the stage to talk to you about how we are optimizing our workforce, reimagining our physical presence and leveraging technology. Damien? Thank you so much, Matt. Extraordinary ecosystems have formed over the pass 20, 30, 40 years as digital has transformed every aspect of how we all do business. That same transformation is happening our homes, meaningfully accelerated in the last two years. And while we started as a music retailer, selling fun to have products, we're now the only company built around the same extraordinary transformation of technology in our lives and in our homes. While others sell some of the same products we do, we alone offered the complete technology solution across manufacturers and operating systems. We are the only company in all channels and at scale that can do everything from design your personalized hardware and software solution in home, to install and connect all of it, to keep it working when there are any issues from unreliable networks to broken screens. These assets appeal not only to our customers but they are also unique and investable for our marketing partners, technology vendors, small business and education relationships and other strategic connections. As we look to the future, we see technology as a permanent and growing need in the home, constantly evolving as the world's largest companies innovate with new use cases around the metaverse, transportation, green electricity and health, just to name a few. We have a unique value creation opportunity into the future and are investing now as we've successfully invested ahead of change in our past to ensure we pivot to meet the needs of our customers and retain our exclusive position in our industry. We are excited to help customers enrich lives through technology in ways no one else can. And with we will break for 10 minutes before beginning our Q&A session. [Break] Welcome back. We are excited to begin the Q&A portion of our event, which we expect to run approximately 45 minutes. But before we do, I want to take this opportunity to introduce and welcome Mark Irvin, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. Many of you spent time with Rob Bass and may know that he recently announced that he is stepping away from a life in retail to pursue some other passions, as we have been discussing for quite some time. We are so excited for him and thank him for his incredible work on our supply chain transformation. That incredible work extended to his ability to bring in top tier talent. One example of that is Mark Irvin, who came to Best Buy in 2013, specifically to work with and learn from Rob. Mark has been an instrumental part of the team that has led our supply chain transformation and is ready to use his lifetime of knowledge in the space to continue to advance our industry-leading supply chain efforts. We are thrilled to have Mark Irvin taking over the reins in supply chain. And we've invited him to join us for Q&A. So, operator, we are now ready for our first question. Yes, I'll start and maybe Matt can add some color. I think that what we're looking at is, as you said, a little bit of a step back in the next year as we lap some of the stimulus. But, I think, there is a number of factors and we outlined some of them in the prepared remarks that we believe will continue to boost the inventory as we head to the other side of next year. So, some of the things that we cited, first of all, you have this real phenomenon where technology is all over our homes, and we are very dependent on that technology and this nesting factor being in our homes is a very sticky behavior. And that's because secondarily, a lot of what we're doing is leveraging tech and people are saying they expect to continue to do that, things like streaming or learning or obviously, all of us probably in some way, shape or form, hybrid working. Those are really -- gaming is another great example. Those are really sticky behaviors that we continue to expect to see over time. And not only that, now you've got 2 times as many connected devices in the home as you had two years ago. So, you have this proliferation of devices. And because the innovation cycles are continuing to ramp, we're also seeing in most of our key categories that replacement cycle already start to shorten. We could literally see it in the last two years in our customers that replacement cycle is shortening. And so, while we think there's a bit of a step back next year, all of this massive interest in the industry, the new ways that people are using technology, the innovations that are happening in spaces like metaverse or some of the things that Jason talked about in his prepared remarks, all of those, we believe, start to create that ramp as we get on the other side of a little bit step back in the next year. Yes. I'll start maybe and then Matt can talk a little bit about the EBIT. On the renewal, we haven't come out with renewal rates. The good news is they continue to be in line with our expectations. So, we're happy with what we're seeing from a renewal perspective, but we do want to give that a bit of time. I think to your second question around the period of time that we're using. First, we've been overt in saying it is a short period of time. We just rolled this out in October, but we wanted to at least give some color on what we're seeing. Second, while you're right, this is a unique period of time, we're comparing it against a control group in the same period of time. So all of the behaviors that we comparing -- because what we're looking at in that 20% lift is a lift in people who purchased and are using Totaltech versus those who would not or had not purchased it. And so, you've got a comparative group there. So, both behaviors in theory should be different. But still, it's holiday, like we've said, it's a short period of time. We wanted to give the initial color, and then we'll keep watching that as we go through the next year, obviously. Karen, I just want to underscore, it is incredibly difficult for us to separate the performance of the stores from digital performance from what Matt was alluding to virtual and call. And if you think about Q4 alone, 65%ish of what we sold online was either picked up in stores. That was about 45%, or shipped from a store. That was about 20%. And so, when you have that amount of crossover, literally -- I mean, it's the best example of like true omnichannel behaviors with our customers. Piecing those things apart is incredibly difficult. Understand, what we're trying to do, to Matt's point, is really build in effectiveness and efficiency across those. So, you create those real frictionless experiences for customers. You have both the convenience, but you also have that amazing experience when they want it. Yes. I'll start and maybe Damien can add some color. We aren't yet providing any of the metrics on performance. And that's because it still is, A, relatively new, and B, this is how a bunch of stores are working together. And I just want to underscore back to the first question that you asked. The beautiful thing about Charlotte is we're really trying to say, what do our stores need to do in the future. Obviously, our online penetration has doubled in the last two years. And that means the role of the store is different. The store is incredibly important. It showcases all the experiences. It is the cornerstone for convenience. And as Matt said in the prepared remarks, more than 99% of our stores are cash flow positive. So, in and of itself, the stores are amazing experiential moments with our customers. And we know that the role of the store will continue to evolve. And what we want to make clear with Charlotte is this is a market now with the same quantity of stores before and after. But, you have 24% less selling square footage, 100% more warehousing and fulfillment and an overall reduction in square footage of 9% in the market. But, you also have consultants going into home. You have more access points than ever, and you cover the market, about 41% of it, with employee delivery. And so, what you're trying to do is create a bigger draw in the market for more customers because you just have all these different experiences. Damien, I don't know if you have anything you want to add? Yes. I'll start. I think that there are broad opportunities in the Best Buy Ads business. Obviously, we have what we would call audiences or kind of suites of customers and information about those customers that's certainly very valuable to our vendors, which is where we over-index right now but can be more valuable broadly to other partners who might be looking for potential consumers who have the kind of same look and feel as our consumer base. And so, while we start kind of near in with those who really understand this unique customer that we have and the unique knowledge we have with that customer, everything from service interactions to purchase interactions to how they decide to use the approximately, all of these are important behavioral points that are important, not just to our vendors, but ultimately, probably to a wider swath of partners. I don't know if you want to hit on how the financials. And Anthony, I think the other part of your question was around the inventory levels that we saw in Q4. And we haven't sized it specifically, but I think it's fair to say we would have been healthy in our range, had we not had some of those very targeted -- and again, I want to be clear. They're very targeted inventory constraints that were just a bit larger than we thought. And I think we expect to see some of those continue into, especially the first half of next year and again in a more targeted way. But our overall inventory situation, I think that's some of what you're seeing in the promotional environment, our overall inventory situation is very healthy. I mean, they are year up 6%, 15% versus two years ago. So, it's just these pockets where we've seen more demand, so that's good, but a little bit more constrained than we were expecting. Michael, I think you have stacked -- and you actually nailed and laid out a lot of them. But you have this kind of stacked quantity of things that both have happened and that we're investing in. I mean, we have tremendously more scale than we had just two years ago with $8 billion added to the top line. And obviously, that -- majority all coming through are digital experiences. So, we've navigated a massive change in the composition of our business. Under that, we've also created material efficiency and effectiveness because I think it's really important to note, we also noted in prepared remarks, in Q4, we saw some of our best NPS results, particularly on the in-store side of things, our teams are doing incredible work garnering skills. 80% of our associates have more than one skill, which allows us to move this labor really flexibly and allows really interesting career paths. So, you've got scale, you've got a really efficient and effective model that now has moved through this changing dynamic. And then, we're layering on top distinct initiatives that we have expectations around return. Totaltech being one, the ads business being another, the health business that we're investing in for our future, the store experience side of things, all of these. We are using behavioral history that we're seeing in our customers to help us predict how we think this model looks in the future. And I would just underscore what Matt said, I give the team a great deal of credit for choosing to double down on these investments now because we do think this is what unlocks exponential growth for us as we head into the future. Maybe I'll start with a little bit of context, and then I'll ask Deborah to come in since she came in partway through the journey. I think it's maybe not as much about what -- maybe what didn't perform as well. I think it's what we're learning about a consumer that has changed a great deal, particularly in the last two years. So, some of those early hypotheses we had around health moving into the home, around people wanting to age in their homes with technology, I think those hypotheses were actually exponentially sped up over the last couple of years. And, we started to see some new use cases around virtual care in particular. So, I think, we felt like we were pointed in the right direction even three, four years ago. It's just that the consumer behaviors have really changed in the last two years, having gone through the pandemic. And now we're refining our focus a bit so that we really target where the industry is going. Maybe Deborah, you could add some color. And Peter, to your question about services, this is so interesting. Because what we're seeing is this really high level of interest and yet confusion around what it is and what I do. I just read a survey that said that 70% of consumers age 65 and older want to try VR experiences, but aren't even sure exactly where to start. And so, sometimes this is consulting services in the home. But sometimes this is as simple as having that wide array of products from all of the vendors and just being willing to help people kind of dabble into, whether it's metaverse or 5G, which becomes really relevant as we're talking about getting out of our homes actually, and being on the go and being able to game and work and learn on the go. So, I think for us, this is long continuum, all the way from coming to the store and we can just help you understand what this is, all the way to, now I have twice as many conducted devices in my home. I want to learn how to leverage a 5G network and maybe get off Wi-Fi. How do I do all of that? And I think over time that -- again, from our unique point of view, that's where we can be helpful to the consumer. Yes. So, if you go back to two, three -- two years ago, 2019, we talked about specifically these customer relationship events. And at the time, if you recall, we underscored things like using the app and having the app. We underscored at that point, Total Tech Support, which we've now evolved into Totaltech obviously. We underscored customers who shop in multiple categories. They were like specific events that people who use our financial services. There were specific events that we were looking at that we said, when customers interact with us in this way, we tend to keep them in our ecosystem; they tend to spend more; they tend to be those more loyal customers. You can imagine, over the last two years, the good news is we have seen some acceleration in those type of events. We've seen more app downloads. We're seeing a 72% increase in people using the app when they're in our stores, great. That's a great data point. We're seeing to what Matt just said, more people take up the Totaltech offering than we were seeing in total tech support, although that was still growing over the last couple of years. We're seeing more -- we just saw a whole bunch of new customers, and we're seeing those customers shop us in multiple categories. So, we're seeing that grow. I think you can see in the presentation that we gave today, it is still very important for us to continue to drive those customer -- deep customer relationships. And we're continuing to evolve how we see those interactions that are most important to those longer-term relationships and almost every strategy that we underscore today, whether it is what Damien talked about in terms of our more experiential stores, or whether it is Totaltech or whether it is a relationship with patient or someone we're helping to provide help for, all of those are the types of relationships that keep customers stickier to the brand. And given we talked a little bit, our frequency is a little bit lower than you can imagine, someone who has grocery or someone who has consumables. And so, this idea of increasing the frequency, staying relevant in the selection is really important to us. And that's, I think, what you can see all of the strategy is geared around those deeper and more prevalent customer relationships. The markets. So, when Matt was talking about the capital guides that we kind of gave, you could see some of that increase in capital. At some point, we're assuming, and Damien talked specifically about the experiential stores, there probably will be some other store concepts that we may choose to roll. But, what I want to say is we've been very clear that the Charlotte market is a pilot, and we mean that. Sometimes people say pilot and then they fully know exactly everything they're going to roll from there. It is a pilot. We are learning from it. And we assume that at some point, we will continue to roll pieces of that model. But, we're not yet ready to say this is exactly the concepts, exactly how many and exactly in what markets. Thank you so much. And with that, we will actually wrap today's investor event. And on behalf of our panelists and all of Best Buy, it has been our pleasure to share our progress with you, and we genuinely thank you for taking the time and all of your questions. Have a great rest of your day."

Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 A.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nMollie O'Brien: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to 2 years ago. Against a still evolving backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customer's technology needs and knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. Our omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future. We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook and connect at home. And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter. We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming and mobile phones. Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday. And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability and acquiring additional alternative transportation. We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate. In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different. But we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year-over-year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday. As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. When compared to 2 years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter. Customers are returning to stores and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic. Online sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. Our app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and 2 years ago. We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. Compared to last year, same day delivery was up 400% and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within one day. Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in one day or less published shipping time across a sample of higher volume ZIP codes and higher demand items. In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability, as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of a delivery location. We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast. In Q3, more than 90% of online orders, that were available for product pickup, were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one third of our store pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option. And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and 2 years ago. In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once. These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology. Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat and in-home sales growing. Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs. Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions, and other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores. We have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing. While we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us and it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company. This means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences. That led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month. Totaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customer's value and no one else can match. Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard to get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection and many other benefits. Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life. A Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount. She gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room. The next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter. As long as she keeps up her membership, she gets 2 years of product protection on the TV she bought and 2 years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone. A few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer. So she hops on the dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer, so she can get on with a productive day of working from home. As a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year. As you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are we will be there to help. The goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy. We successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members. It is very early as we just launched last month. But so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than non-members. Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program. NPS numbers across all channels are higher than for non-members as well. And importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers. As we discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests. Of course, we are always piloting concepts. But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that is focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us. I will provide a few updates on our progress. We launched Phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor. It has no physical customers. Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays and physical products. It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet. But initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions. In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment services and outlet lockers, our digital app and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and re-modeled 8 stores. And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year. These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company. From Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce. This is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers. I also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services. We have almost 3,000 consultants and designers to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in stores and virtually. These consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences consistently over 80. Importantly, they also lead to longer term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants. Turning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider. Our Geek Squad has an industry leading set of capabilities that garner market leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time. Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair. Additionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months. Over time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior. Our in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage. We have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences. Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers. We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one third of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy. In October, we launched Samsung authorized phone repair service nationally. Roughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day in-store repairs completed by Samsung certified Geek Squad agents, using Samsung parts, diagnostics and tools. Phone repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace. In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy online, pick up in store experience in partnerships with our vendors. Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store and shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores. For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale. And finally, we have been investing in our long standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers. Best Buy's relevance, customer relationship, and first-party data have grown along with customer's technology needs and our ability to meet those needs. These are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot. In addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation. And during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled. As a result, we are expanding our online assortment of electric bikes by four times and also plan to assort them in physical stores early next year. And because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we have been expanding our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, just to name a few. In fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables and accessories. We are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business both online and in physical locations across the nation. We also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space. Let me take a second to reiterate our overall health strategy and how the acquisition fits. Our Best Buy Health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients to physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example. You can see this built out in a robust way on our website. The second area is active aging, which includes device based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to live independently in their homes. This opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores. The third focus area is virtual care. Best Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their health care providers. The trend to this type of care is increasing, accelerated in large measure by the pandemic. To more fully meet that growing customer demand and accelerate our work with new and innovative services, we acquired a company called Current Health. Current Health developed a market leading remote patient monitoring platform that allows physicians to monitor and connect with patients in their home. Their platform includes an FDA cleared wearable medical device that monitors vital signs, a home hub, which integrates to hundreds of other monitoring devices, and integration to the patient's electronic health record. With their remote monitoring platform, combined with the scale, expertise and connection to the home that Best Buy has, we will be able to create a holistic care ecosystem that shows up for customers across all their health care needs. To be clear, even though the health care industry is evolving quickly, in many ways as a result of the pandemic impacts, it adopts new ways of doing things at a much slower pace than other industries like retail. Virtual care is a truly nascent space with significant opportunity, but it will take time and investment to develop our offerings and scale. As you can see, technology developments are driving our initiatives across the company. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers. That is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments. For example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Totaltech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores. We also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability, so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby or when it could be delivered and installed. Technology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award winning appliance customer experience. Metro delivery customers, that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery, can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time. It may seem like a small enhancement, but already, we can see significant customer engagement with the page. Another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment and use of their large product. Technology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets. Next month, we are launching a new capability, leveraging QR codes for high-velocity products that are locked up, particularly in areas of high shrink. Instead of waiting for an associate to unlock the product, the customer can scan the QR code and then proceed to check out to pay and pick up the product. And we recently implemented enhancements to our digital platform, improving flexibility across our workforce by seamlessly giving employees the ability to pick up open shifts at nearby locations in addition to their home location. These examples are a small token of the work our digital and technology teams are doing to improve the customer and employee experience. And of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness. I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people. Over the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases were disrespectful. In addition, we have increased the level of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model. This has introduced a great deal of change. We know that change is exciting, but we acknowledge it can also be challenging. I am truly grateful for and impressed by our associate's dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. And I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus 2 years ago before the pandemic despite all of these disruptions. Now I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet. Earlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. Best Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. We are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040. We have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers. In Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills. To help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills. We also kept more than 600,000 devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek squad repair services and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth. In summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams. We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well positioned with both the tech customer's wants and fast and convenient ways to get it. We launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers. And this past Friday, started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available. Throughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside, will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products. Building on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care, and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before. The penetration of technology associated with this way of living has been and continues to be sizable. And we are already seeing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves and we constantly optimize our homes. The demand for convenience and experience on the customers' terms has exponentially driven change. Our hypothesis has consistently been that true omnichannel retailing would create differentiated experiences that allow us to seamlessly and conveniently engage and retain customers. As such, we have continuously invested in these experiences and notably, we never defined omnichannel as being stores and online. Instead, we included our unique and powerful service, virtual and in-home capabilities. We are certain that technology will continue to play a more dominant role in consumers' lives. Given our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently. We plan to hold an Investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward and introduce longer-term financial targets. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more color on our financial results.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives and we are uniquely positioned to serve them. Despite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter. Compared to our guidance, Enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were essentially in line with our expectations. Compared to last year, Enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02. A lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.8% decreased 30 basis points as we invested in the launch of our new Totaltech membership. When comparing our results against 2 years ago for the third quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 20%. Additionally, our Domestic store channel revenue was approximately flat versus 2 years ago, while online revenue grew almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. Let me now share more details specific to our third quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. As Corie shared, the biggest contributors to the comp sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. After delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but still up nearly $1 billion from 2 years ago. In addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our new Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue generating services such as warranty and installation. In our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of approximately $90 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 3% in Canada. Partially offsetting these items was the benefit of approximately 450 basis points from foreign currency. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 23.4%. As expected, the decrease was due to, one, lower profit margin rates, which were primarily driven by lapping lower levels of promotions, product damages and returns compared to last year as well as higher inventory shrink. And two, lower services margin rates, which included rate pressure from Totaltech. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. The gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. As Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain. However, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and a loss of lower margin sales from the Mexico exit. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $9 million and improved 20 basis points versus last year as a percentage of revenue. As expected, higher advertising expense and increased technology investments were partially offset by last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation. When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume, partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. Earlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4. The combined purchase price of the two transactions was approximately $485 million and they were funded with cash. The Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income. We are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year. During the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter. We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We are confident in our ability to navigate the ever changing environment. From a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year. The largest drivers of SG&A increase are expected to be technology investments, increased advertising, health investments, and higher compensation, in addition, incentive compensation. In addition, we are planning on increased spend compared to our previous outlook for store labor and call center support this holiday season to better support the customer experience. Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion. Comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter, particularly your ability to comp the comp against that really tough comparison year-over-year. So having said all that, one thing that just struck me a little bit was that you simply [ph] called out shrink as a gross margin headwind. I was just wondering if you can just provide a little bit more color around that? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yeah, absolutely, Anthony. I think you've probably seen in the media that across retail, we are definitely seeing more and more, particularly, organized retail crime and incidence of shrink in our locations. And I think you've heard other retailers talk about it, and we certainly have seen it as well. I want to start with, our priority has always been and will remain the safety of our people, whether that's the pandemic, whether that is unruly customers, whether that is outright theft, which is a great deal of what we're seeing right now, and this is a real issue that hurts and scares real people. We are doing a number of things to protect our people and our customers. We are - as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we are finding ways where we can lock up product but still make that a good customer experience. In some instances, we're hiring security. We're working with our vendors on creative ways we can stage the product. We're working with trade organizations. But you can see that pressure in our financials. And more importantly, frankly, you can see that pressure our associates. This is traumatizing for our associates and is unacceptable. We are doing everything we can to try to create as safe as possible environments.\nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. Good luck with the holiday selling season.\nCorie Barry: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nHannah Pittock: Hi. This is actually Hannah Pittock on for Simeon Gutman. Thanks for taking the time. I wanted to ask on your Q4 guide. On the top line, it implies a pretty big deceleration on the comp stack. Are you seeing a slowdown in demand? Was there some pull forward do you think in holiday purchasing into Q3 or is there maybe some conservatism built in there? Any detail you can give?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I'll take that. This is Matt. We're projecting Q4 comps to be up 1% to down 2% compared to last year. The guidance range we actually gave is slightly up from the implied guidance range from last quarter. As a reminder, in August, we materially raised our sales guidance for the back half of the year from the expectations we had that we started the year. We still feel really confident about our inventory levels and our positioning for the holiday. And so I'd say Q4 is a little bit more unique of a period of time, a place where our category is leveraged by many retailers over the holiday gifting season. I would also say that some sales probably got pulled into October summer [ph] last year as a lot of the narrative in the media and supply chain constraints were our consumers. So during the first three weeks of last year as well, the gaming consoles released, which provided a bit of a lift. And we're also very mindful of lapping the stimulus dollars that came in January. As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October, the sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January. The last thing I'd say about Q4 is Super Bowl actually, majority of the business is shifting into Q1 of next year. We're starting the November about flattish sales. So we're still encouraged by the holiday demand that the consumer is very strong still, and so we're excited and think we're well positioned.\nHannah Pittock: That's very helpful. Maybe a quick follow-up just on your Domestic versus International segment. Obviously, Domestic kind of decelerated sequentially, and International actually picked up. In Q4, can you tell us anything about kind of the relative contribution you expect?\nMatt Bilunas: I would expect that contribution to be relatively the same in Q3. Our International business on a 2 year basis was pretty similar to the US. They actually did stronger sales in Q3 last year than the Domestic business. So relative to the US pretty consistent. And a lot of the same drivers for the US business are similar internationally as well.\nHannah Pittock: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. And good morning. So I guess focusing a little bit on the gross margin and the adoption of Totaltech. Just curious on that impact in the third quarter - as you think about the fourth quarter, down 30 basis points expected, so the Totaltech is a number than that. I was just curious how much of that is sort of diminishment of warranty sales versus more of an accounting phenomenon that you're sort of recognizing the benefit of Totaltech over an extended period of time versus prior?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. Good morning. Yeah, the Totaltech impact essentially is due to just the enhanced benefits for that offering versus the Totaltech support offering as we've talked about last quarter. It's really that additional benefit that drives more of the - more short term pressure on the gross margin rate. There is a little bit of revenue recognition difference between Totaltech support and Totaltech with Totaltech support a bit more was recognized in the first couple of months. Totaltech support is more spread out across the entire year of some more of that pressure is coming from that. But I'd also note that the whole goal of Totaltech support is to actually drive more sales and then drive more product sales and that will take a little bit of time as we start to ramp up the program. So that will help offset some of the pressure you see from the cannibalization of the services business.\nChristopher Horvers: And just as a quick follow-up on the last question. Do you have a sense or an estimate of perhaps how much January actually benefited from stimulus as we think about the sequencing of the current quarter?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. I mean, we said all of last year that stimulus is really hard to break out. It certainly did have a benefit. We could see the business change in January from the previous months. So we know it did have an impact. It's really hard to break out specifically.\nChristopher Horvers: Got it. Understood. Have a great holiday season.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you. So there are some other big box retailers that have gotten more invested in helping customers age in place, which you talked about in the prepared remarks. Clearly, there's a bigger focus on technology and Connected Health at Best Buy. How are you working on increasing customer awareness? Like what does the marketing look like for this particular initiative?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Liz. We have been really focused on this idea that tech could be instrumental in helping people age more comfortably in their homes for quite a while. It started with our purchase of a GreatCall a few years ago. And part of the reason that we brought GreatCall on board is they had massive experience in dealing with an aging population. And specifically to your question, targeting the right messages to the right people, which is not just targeting the aging population, it's also targeting caregivers who may be looking for some of this product. And so you've seen us over time. We established a relationship with AARP back in March of 2020 as one of our venues. We have a lot of actually, in this space, direct mail and direct targeting because for the populations that we're looking at here, those are some of the most effective means that we have. And then over time, I think you're going to see some of our more broad-based Best Buy messaging, really pointing to the fact that we have a variety of solutions that can help people age in their homes. It's not always just the devices and the care wrappers. Sometimes it's things like a Facebook portal where you can connect with someone on the other side really simply and easily or a device \u2013 you know, a camera and a security system where I can easily lock my door without having to get up or I can keep an eye on that aging loved one. And I think already, you've seen me will continue to see run the gamut of both these very targeted messages to the population that we really want to inform all the way to these kind of more broad-based solution driven messages about what we could help you do to care for a loved one.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. And just a follow-up on how Totaltech could potentially play into that? And if there are any key performance indicators you can highlight that you're looking at on total effect as you track the opportunity there?\nCorie Barry: Well, what's interesting about Totaltech in the aging in place scenario is that, it is more important than ever that your technology works for you if you're relying on it for your safety or if you're a caregiver if you're relying on it for the safety of others. And so the support wrapper around all of the things that we're talking about in health is important. And it also will help, obviously, this population, whether it's the caregiver again or the person being cared for, add more devices, feel comfortable adding devices. We can go to your own and help you install those, and then we can keep them up and running, and I think that's really important. In terms of the KPIs that we look at, it's really true across Totaltech. We're looking for things like increased frequency of interactions. And that may be everything from browsing on the website all the way to coming in the store and making an actual purchase. We're looking for stickiness of that consumer, meaning they're more willing to come back Best Buy bigger share of wallet, more purchase behavior with Best Buy over the longer term. And that will be true whether we're talking about aging in place or whether we're talking about the other aspects of Totaltech. And then obviously, we're going to look for customer satisfaction and engagement with the brand and really trying to almost surprise and delight and over deliver wherever we can for these paying members.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: You bit. Thanks, Liz.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Nice quarter, congrats.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So the question I have, just with regard to promotions. So you called out here in the third quarter, higher promotions is somewhat of a headwind to gross margins. But you also made the point that the promotional activity is still more subdued than it was pre-pandemic. And then I don't think you gave the guidance for Q4 within the down 30 basis points in gross margin, I think there was a mention promotion. So the question I have is as you look at what's happening out with promotions, maybe some more color on \u2013 there is greater color on kind of who are what's driving these promotions. And then where do you think we're going? Are we heading back to pre-pandemic levels or do you foresee promotional activity remaining more subdued as we go forward?\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, Brian. Yeah, I think in Q3, we've talked about how we expected promotionality to increase, and we certainly saw that, especially in places where inventory is starting to become a little more freeing up and notably in computing. We didn't call it out in Q4, and Q4 product margin rates are expected to be a little bit better, more from product mix, mixing out of things, gaming consoles and computing. At this point, promotionality, we don't necessarily see it as a good guy or a bad guy in Q4. As you would imagine, Q4 is very promotional and competitive every year. And so right now, so last year, we were very focused on that as well. This year, we will continue to look at. But we don't expect it on a yearly basis to be necessarily more or less promotional. Now against 2 years ago, certainly, we would expect it to be a little less promotional than we saw 2 years ago. Where it heads is something that we're going to have to monitor. That's one of the kind of still things that we're evaluating for next year. Clearly, as inventory becomes more free, you can imagine that promotionality is going to start to increase in categories more one at a time as we get into next year. And so likely starting the year with a little bit more promotionality. But we're not really guiding next year, but I would expect that to start to turn over the next number of quarters.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. A second quick follow-up, if I could. Just with regard to - so appliance is a key sales driver here in Q3. Lot of talk about higher prices in appliances, so the question I have is to what extent was inflation in that category actually an incremental sales driver for you?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. Specifically to appliances, that is one of the areas where it's been pretty well noted that prices have gone up. And so we - and that's probably an area where, in most cases, we've those prices on to the consumer. So those prices have - or sales prices have increased. That's not to say that, that happens in all circumstances and a lot of categories where you still want to make sure you're very competitive with our pricing, even if costs do go up your, you're actually being thoughtful about serving them in the best way possible. I think generally, as you look at our ASPs, inflation - the inflation or cost of those goods going up is still the smaller part of those - what we would see as ASP increases right now, still the bigger part of the ASP increases would be just premium mix of our business right now versus the inflation estimate. So it is a little higher generally overall than we saw in the first half of the year, but still not the biggest impact to ASPs.\nCorie Barry: And Brian, I think this is why in this space, we continue to really invest in the experience because our ability to deliver on some of those more premium items in the assortment is really distinctive and different. And so this investment - and this is a great example of the investment in the experience is not just for today, but it's so that we continue to represent the premium side of the business over the longer term.\nBrian Nagel: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I had a two part question. One was I wanted to understand a little bit more about the SG&A dollar growth in the fourth quarter. How much of that is due to the acquisitions or the particular membership investment? And how much of that is just the inflation or normal growth in the business?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. The Q4 SG&A, essentially, we have to first start with the idea. Our business is very different than it has been over the last few years. Over 2 years ago, the way customers are shopping, the channel they're shopping is very different. And there's just a lot more volume coming through generally compared a couple of years ago. So as you look at a year-over-year difference, we're still seeing continued investments in technology and health being a driver of that SG&A increase. Our advertising is also an area where it's up year-over-year. And that is included and that is the total tech launch that we've talked about. We're actually also increasing our store and call center labor to better support the customer experience. Last year, in Q4, it was probably - we would say probably running the light from where we wanted to be. So we've made the decision to invest a little bit more from a customer experience standpoint. And while incentive compensation was flat on a year-over-year basis in the back half of this year, is going to be flat. The pressure in Q4 is actually a pressure in Q4 versus a slight of a good eye in Q3. So those are what's driving the SG&A on a year-over-year basis. And a lot of we're doing is really focused on investing as we've talked about to make sure our customer experience is in the right spot, and we're actually positioning ourselves well for the future.\nGreg Melich: And maybe to flip it around a little bit, inventory up, I guess, 15% year-on-year and still 13% versus 2019. How should we think about that growth in inventory versus a comp that looks like it will be flattish in the fourth quarter, at least in your plan?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. I mean when you look at it versus a 2 year sales volume increase, I mean, the inventory is much more in line. We actually, when we look at our inventory, look at how many days of supply we have outstanding and we're in that very normal range of days of supply at this point. Now there's still pockets of constraint in areas like gaming consoles and things like that, but we feel really good about it on a 2 year basis. It's seemingly - it's in line for us as we look forward to the sales.\nCorie Barry: And Greg, I would just underscore something Matt said in his prepared remarks, we were unduly light last year in inventory. And that's why we're going back to the 2 year \u2013 2 year stack growth of right in that 13% range and then inventory 2 year in that same range. So I just think last year is not a great indicator because I think everyone was looking - we certainly were looking for more last year.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And I guess if I could cheat with one more. Has the business - the seasonality of the operating margin sort of fundamentally changed now with the growth of services, Total Tech? Or is that still an anomaly, you think?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah...\nGreg Melich: Improved margins look like the rest of the year?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah, I think what you've seen from us this year, last year was a little unique each quarter. But this year, what you've seen is actually improved operating margin rates in each of the first three quarters more than what we've seen. If you look at a 2 year stack, it's much different in the first three quarters. I think just generally, technology is important for all our lives regardless of how the seasons and seasons that are starting to spread out across the year. So the operating margins have on a relative 2 year basis have been improving in the first 3 quarters. And quite honestly, the volumes in Q4, it's very important for us to make sure we have the right expense profile to support the customers.\nGreg Melich: Okay.\nCorie Barry: Just one more little bit of color and again, at it in his remarks, but this will be the first full quarter of Totaltech too. And so you'll start to see that go through into next year as you get into those other quarters. So that makes it a little different this year comparing Q4 to the rest of the course. But everything Matt said in the rest of it. I mean, our goal would actually be a little bit more even business throughout the year, ultimately.\nGreg Melich: Makes sense. Congrats. Have a great holiday.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I just had two questions on all the pilots that you mentioned in the prepared comments. First, with the virtual store, how are you thinking about this longer term? Do you think it will be a concept where you just need one? Or is it something that rolls out and will always be integrated into a DC? And then the flexible labor model, I know it's early and also in a pilot stage, but has this helped you at all in finding workers in this tight labor market? And how do you think about potential savings from this initiative?\nCorie Barry: So I'll start with virtual store. Obviously, really early into this, so we're really just getting our legs under is. So it's hard for me to say whether or not there's more than one. The nice part is you should be able to get very good from one location in a model like this, right. Because you can flexibly queue people and you can move them through at your own speed, and you could do this across all the departments in this kind of fake store that's virtual. So I don't think this is going to be about a ton of virtual stores throughout the network. I think it's going to be about scale with a few locations that can provide some interesting use cases. Because truthfully, it's not just about the customer use cases where they might find the virtual store where they're doing digital shopping. It also could be about employee use cases, where I might be in the car installation area and may not have the expertise, but I could zoom right into one of our installation, our Autotech experts who could help you in the moment even as an employee, it gives you a lot of confidence there, too. So I think what we want to find out right now is what are the use cases? How often is it being used? And then ultimately, what does that customer experience look like? But like we said in the prepared remarks, we'd like what we're seeing early. And we'll see just how far you can stretch this kind of one asset that we have right now. In terms of flexible labor, absolutely, it is helpful for us in this environment, and it's helpful on a couple of levels. One, the customer shopping behaviors have changed and they continue to change and they can change week-to-week depending on how important something like speed is as an example. Like the week before Christmas, in-store pickup curbside will become very important assets. And with a more flexible model, I can move employees and employees can being moved to different areas in the store. That means they can pick up more hours or potentially more flexible hours. The other thing that hasn't been brought to light as much as there still are many people calling in sick, which we want. If they're not feeling well, we want them to stay home. A model like this allows you to much more flexibly cover for those call offs. So it's not just about hiring and retention. It's actually about how can I move the labor around the store in the most flexible way. And then the last thing I would say is we have more employees than ever in the history of the company that are skilled in multiple areas in the store. And that isn't just about us flexibly leveraging that labor. That is about them opting into potentially schedules and even in some cases, pay grades that meets whatever they want to try to accomplish in their lives. And that's really for the employee the more positive side of the flexible arrangement and ultimately adding to more confidence in their capabilities and their interactions with customers. That's why we tend to see higher NPS correlate very highly with multiple skill sets.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. And good morning. My first question is around the Totaltech offering and how we think about that into 2022? Should we be thinking about 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin pressure through at least the first half of the year? And should we think about additional sales contributions building through 2022?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. As you can imagine, we're not in a position to guide for next year. What we've talked about is the more benefits included in Total Tech certainly are causing a near-term pressure on the business. Some of those things will continue on. A lot of what we're still trying to do is understand the incrementality, the usage, the frequency, all of those things go into understanding what the overall increment does to the business. In addition to that incremental sales of our products, we're still in the process of evaluating. So I would imagine to be a continued pressure heading into next year, exactly how much we're still trying to evaluate.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is, when we think about the market's growth rate potential over the next year or so, given the fact that tech is more important than ever in consumers' lives, is this market one that's likely to continue growing in the near term? Or are there pressure points because of the some of the year-over-year comparisons with computing and other areas have seen such a surge in growth from the pandemic?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. I mean, I think certainly it's something we're evaluating over what the market is going to look like over the next few years. We're certainly not in a position to guide next year from a sales perspective either. You're right, comping, there's going to be some big quarters next year. We grew 27% in the first half of last year. So we very much could see some bumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But again, fundamentally, we believe that our customers never technology has only grown and that we have a very unique way to serve those customers, and there's still a lot of long-term opportunities. We're excited about our Total Tech membership program. We're excited about investing more in our business around technology and our operating model changing in our store portfolio. So there's a lot of room for optimism in addition to understanding that Total Tech's that much more important. We'll have to see where the industry goes.\nCorie Barry: Yeah. And just to underscore, I think you'll continue to see product innovation at an accelerated pace. And you will see CE proliferate into other areas like you're seeing it proliferate into health care or even into outdoor spaces. And so I think that makes it even harder for us to answer the question because it's not even just about how you define the market. It's about how the market, in essence, expands over time because it taps into new areas. And that's the part that really has us excited for the future even if to Matt's point, there might be a bumpy quarter here or there. It's really the sustainability of CE as an ever-evolving space from here on out.\nCorie Barry: And with that, I want to thank all of you so much for joining us today, and I know it's a very busy earnings season, so we appreciate it. And happy holidays to all of you, and we look forward to seeing you in March.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives and we are uniquely positioned to serve them. Despite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter. Compared to our guidance, Enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were essentially in line with our expectations. Compared to last year, Enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02. A lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.8% decreased 30 basis points as we invested in the launch of our new Totaltech membership. When comparing our results against 2 years ago for the third quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 20%. Additionally, our Domestic store channel revenue was approximately flat versus 2 years ago, while online revenue grew almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. Let me now share more details specific to our third quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. As Corie shared, the biggest contributors to the comp sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. After delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but still up nearly $1 billion from 2 years ago. In addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our new Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue generating services such as warranty and installation. In our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of approximately $90 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 3% in Canada. Partially offsetting these items was the benefit of approximately 450 basis points from foreign currency. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 23.4%. As expected, the decrease was due to, one, lower profit margin rates, which were primarily driven by lapping lower levels of promotions, product damages and returns compared to last year as well as higher inventory shrink. And two, lower services margin rates, which included rate pressure from Totaltech. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. The gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. As Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain. However, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and a loss of lower margin sales from the Mexico exit. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $9 million and improved 20 basis points versus last year as a percentage of revenue. As expected, higher advertising expense and increased technology investments were partially offset by last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation. When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume, partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. Earlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4. The combined purchase price of the two transactions was approximately $485 million and they were funded with cash. The Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income. We are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year. During the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter. We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We are confident in our ability to navigate the ever changing environment. From a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year. The largest drivers of SG&A increase are expected to be technology investments, increased advertising, health investments, and higher compensation, in addition, incentive compensation. In addition, we are planning on increased spend compared to our previous outlook for store labor and call center support this holiday season to better support the customer experience. Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion. Comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Sure. I'll take that. This is Matt. We're projecting Q4 comps to be up 1% to down 2% compared to last year. The guidance range we actually gave is slightly up from the implied guidance range from last quarter. As a reminder, in August, we materially raised our sales guidance for the back half of the year from the expectations we had that we started the year. We still feel really confident about our inventory levels and our positioning for the holiday. And so I'd say Q4 is a little bit more unique of a period of time, a place where our category is leveraged by many retailers over the holiday gifting season. I would also say that some sales probably got pulled into October summer [ph] last year as a lot of the narrative in the media and supply chain constraints were our consumers. So during the first three weeks of last year as well, the gaming consoles released, which provided a bit of a lift. And we're also very mindful of lapping the stimulus dollars that came in January. As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October, the sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January. The last thing I'd say about Q4 is Super Bowl actually, majority of the business is shifting into Q1 of next year. We're starting the November about flattish sales. So we're still encouraged by the holiday demand that the consumer is very strong still, and so we're excited and think we're well positioned. I would expect that contribution to be relatively the same in Q3. Our International business on a 2 year basis was pretty similar to the US. They actually did stronger sales in Q3 last year than the Domestic business. So relative to the US pretty consistent. And a lot of the same drivers for the US business are similar internationally as well. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah, the Totaltech impact essentially is due to just the enhanced benefits for that offering versus the Totaltech support offering as we've talked about last quarter. It's really that additional benefit that drives more of the - more short term pressure on the gross margin rate. There is a little bit of revenue recognition difference between Totaltech support and Totaltech with Totaltech support a bit more was recognized in the first couple of months. Totaltech support is more spread out across the entire year of some more of that pressure is coming from that. But I'd also note that the whole goal of Totaltech support is to actually drive more sales and then drive more product sales and that will take a little bit of time as we start to ramp up the program. So that will help offset some of the pressure you see from the cannibalization of the services business. Yeah. I mean, we said all of last year that stimulus is really hard to break out. It certainly did have a benefit. We could see the business change in January from the previous months. So we know it did have an impact. It's really hard to break out specifically. Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Yeah, I think in Q3, we've talked about how we expected promotionality to increase, and we certainly saw that, especially in places where inventory is starting to become a little more freeing up and notably in computing. We didn't call it out in Q4, and Q4 product margin rates are expected to be a little bit better, more from product mix, mixing out of things, gaming consoles and computing. At this point, promotionality, we don't necessarily see it as a good guy or a bad guy in Q4. As you would imagine, Q4 is very promotional and competitive every year. And so right now, so last year, we were very focused on that as well. This year, we will continue to look at. But we don't expect it on a yearly basis to be necessarily more or less promotional. Now against 2 years ago, certainly, we would expect it to be a little less promotional than we saw 2 years ago. Where it heads is something that we're going to have to monitor. That's one of the kind of still things that we're evaluating for next year. Clearly, as inventory becomes more free, you can imagine that promotionality is going to start to increase in categories more one at a time as we get into next year. And so likely starting the year with a little bit more promotionality. But we're not really guiding next year, but I would expect that to start to turn over the next number of quarters. Yeah. Specifically to appliances, that is one of the areas where it's been pretty well noted that prices have gone up. And so we - and that's probably an area where, in most cases, we've those prices on to the consumer. So those prices have - or sales prices have increased. That's not to say that, that happens in all circumstances and a lot of categories where you still want to make sure you're very competitive with our pricing, even if costs do go up your, you're actually being thoughtful about serving them in the best way possible. I think generally, as you look at our ASPs, inflation - the inflation or cost of those goods going up is still the smaller part of those - what we would see as ASP increases right now, still the bigger part of the ASP increases would be just premium mix of our business right now versus the inflation estimate. So it is a little higher generally overall than we saw in the first half of the year, but still not the biggest impact to ASPs. Sure. The Q4 SG&A, essentially, we have to first start with the idea. Our business is very different than it has been over the last few years. Over 2 years ago, the way customers are shopping, the channel they're shopping is very different. And there's just a lot more volume coming through generally compared a couple of years ago. So as you look at a year-over-year difference, we're still seeing continued investments in technology and health being a driver of that SG&A increase. Our advertising is also an area where it's up year-over-year. And that is included and that is the total tech launch that we've talked about. We're actually also increasing our store and call center labor to better support the customer experience. Last year, in Q4, it was probably - we would say probably running the light from where we wanted to be. So we've made the decision to invest a little bit more from a customer experience standpoint. And while incentive compensation was flat on a year-over-year basis in the back half of this year, is going to be flat. The pressure in Q4 is actually a pressure in Q4 versus a slight of a good eye in Q3. So those are what's driving the SG&A on a year-over-year basis. And a lot of we're doing is really focused on investing as we've talked about to make sure our customer experience is in the right spot, and we're actually positioning ourselves well for the future. Yeah. I mean when you look at it versus a 2 year sales volume increase, I mean, the inventory is much more in line. We actually, when we look at our inventory, look at how many days of supply we have outstanding and we're in that very normal range of days of supply at this point. Now there's still pockets of constraint in areas like gaming consoles and things like that, but we feel really good about it on a 2 year basis. It's seemingly - it's in line for us as we look forward to the sales. Yeah... Yeah, I think what you've seen from us this year, last year was a little unique each quarter. But this year, what you've seen is actually improved operating margin rates in each of the first three quarters more than what we've seen. If you look at a 2 year stack, it's much different in the first three quarters. I think just generally, technology is important for all our lives regardless of how the seasons and seasons that are starting to spread out across the year. So the operating margins have on a relative 2 year basis have been improving in the first 3 quarters. And quite honestly, the volumes in Q4, it's very important for us to make sure we have the right expense profile to support the customers. Yeah. As you can imagine, we're not in a position to guide for next year. What we've talked about is the more benefits included in Total Tech certainly are causing a near-term pressure on the business. Some of those things will continue on. A lot of what we're still trying to do is understand the incrementality, the usage, the frequency, all of those things go into understanding what the overall increment does to the business. In addition to that incremental sales of our products, we're still in the process of evaluating. So I would imagine to be a continued pressure heading into next year, exactly how much we're still trying to evaluate. Yeah. I mean, I think certainly it's something we're evaluating over what the market is going to look like over the next few years. We're certainly not in a position to guide next year from a sales perspective either. You're right, comping, there's going to be some big quarters next year. We grew 27% in the first half of last year. So we very much could see some bumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But again, fundamentally, we believe that our customers never technology has only grown and that we have a very unique way to serve those customers, and there's still a lot of long-term opportunities. We're excited about our Total Tech membership program. We're excited about investing more in our business around technology and our operating model changing in our store portfolio. So there's a lot of room for optimism in addition to understanding that Total Tech's that much more important. We'll have to see where the industry goes."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to 2 years ago. Against a still evolving backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customer's technology needs and knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. Our omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future. We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook and connect at home. And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter. We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming and mobile phones. Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday. And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability and acquiring additional alternative transportation. We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate. In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different. But we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year-over-year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday. As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. When compared to 2 years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter. Customers are returning to stores and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic. Online sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. Our app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and 2 years ago. We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. Compared to last year, same day delivery was up 400% and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within one day. Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in one day or less published shipping time across a sample of higher volume ZIP codes and higher demand items. In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability, as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of a delivery location. We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast. In Q3, more than 90% of online orders, that were available for product pickup, were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one third of our store pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option. And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and 2 years ago. In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once. These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology. Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat and in-home sales growing. Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs. Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions, and other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores. We have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing. While we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us and it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company. This means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences. That led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month. Totaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customer's value and no one else can match. Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard to get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection and many other benefits. Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life. A Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount. She gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room. The next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter. As long as she keeps up her membership, she gets 2 years of product protection on the TV she bought and 2 years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone. A few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer. So she hops on the dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer, so she can get on with a productive day of working from home. As a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year. As you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are we will be there to help. The goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy. We successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members. It is very early as we just launched last month. But so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than non-members. Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program. NPS numbers across all channels are higher than for non-members as well. And importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers. As we discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests. Of course, we are always piloting concepts. But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that is focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us. I will provide a few updates on our progress. We launched Phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor. It has no physical customers. Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays and physical products. It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet. But initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions. In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment services and outlet lockers, our digital app and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and re-modeled 8 stores. And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year. These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company. From Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce. This is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers. I also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services. We have almost 3,000 consultants and designers to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in stores and virtually. These consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences consistently over 80. Importantly, they also lead to longer term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants. Turning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider. Our Geek Squad has an industry leading set of capabilities that garner market leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time. Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair. Additionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months. Over time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior. Our in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage. We have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences. Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers. We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one third of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy. In October, we launched Samsung authorized phone repair service nationally. Roughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day in-store repairs completed by Samsung certified Geek Squad agents, using Samsung parts, diagnostics and tools. Phone repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace. In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy online, pick up in store experience in partnerships with our vendors. Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store and shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores. For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale. And finally, we have been investing in our long standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers. Best Buy's relevance, customer relationship, and first-party data have grown along with customer's technology needs and our ability to meet those needs. These are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot. In addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation. And during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled. As a result, we are expanding our online assortment of electric bikes by four times and also plan to assort them in physical stores early next year. And because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we have been expanding our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, just to name a few. In fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables and accessories. We are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business both online and in physical locations across the nation. We also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space. Let me take a second to reiterate our overall health strategy and how the acquisition fits. Our Best Buy Health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients to physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example. You can see this built out in a robust way on our website. The second area is active aging, which includes device based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to live independently in their homes. This opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores. The third focus area is virtual care. Best Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their health care providers. The trend to this type of care is increasing, accelerated in large measure by the pandemic. To more fully meet that growing customer demand and accelerate our work with new and innovative services, we acquired a company called Current Health. Current Health developed a market leading remote patient monitoring platform that allows physicians to monitor and connect with patients in their home. Their platform includes an FDA cleared wearable medical device that monitors vital signs, a home hub, which integrates to hundreds of other monitoring devices, and integration to the patient's electronic health record. With their remote monitoring platform, combined with the scale, expertise and connection to the home that Best Buy has, we will be able to create a holistic care ecosystem that shows up for customers across all their health care needs. To be clear, even though the health care industry is evolving quickly, in many ways as a result of the pandemic impacts, it adopts new ways of doing things at a much slower pace than other industries like retail. Virtual care is a truly nascent space with significant opportunity, but it will take time and investment to develop our offerings and scale. As you can see, technology developments are driving our initiatives across the company. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers. That is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments. For example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Totaltech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores. We also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability, so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby or when it could be delivered and installed. Technology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award winning appliance customer experience. Metro delivery customers, that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery, can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time. It may seem like a small enhancement, but already, we can see significant customer engagement with the page. Another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment and use of their large product. Technology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets. Next month, we are launching a new capability, leveraging QR codes for high-velocity products that are locked up, particularly in areas of high shrink. Instead of waiting for an associate to unlock the product, the customer can scan the QR code and then proceed to check out to pay and pick up the product. And we recently implemented enhancements to our digital platform, improving flexibility across our workforce by seamlessly giving employees the ability to pick up open shifts at nearby locations in addition to their home location. These examples are a small token of the work our digital and technology teams are doing to improve the customer and employee experience. And of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness. I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people. Over the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases were disrespectful. In addition, we have increased the level of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model. This has introduced a great deal of change. We know that change is exciting, but we acknowledge it can also be challenging. I am truly grateful for and impressed by our associate's dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. And I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus 2 years ago before the pandemic despite all of these disruptions. Now I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet. Earlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. Best Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. We are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040. We have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers. In Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills. To help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills. We also kept more than 600,000 devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek squad repair services and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth. In summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams. We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well positioned with both the tech customer's wants and fast and convenient ways to get it. We launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers. And this past Friday, started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available. Throughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside, will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products. Building on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care, and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before. The penetration of technology associated with this way of living has been and continues to be sizable. And we are already seeing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves and we constantly optimize our homes. The demand for convenience and experience on the customers' terms has exponentially driven change. Our hypothesis has consistently been that true omnichannel retailing would create differentiated experiences that allow us to seamlessly and conveniently engage and retain customers. As such, we have continuously invested in these experiences and notably, we never defined omnichannel as being stores and online. Instead, we included our unique and powerful service, virtual and in-home capabilities. We are certain that technology will continue to play a more dominant role in consumers' lives. Given our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently. We plan to hold an Investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward and introduce longer-term financial targets. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more color on our financial results. Yeah, absolutely, Anthony. I think you've probably seen in the media that across retail, we are definitely seeing more and more, particularly, organized retail crime and incidence of shrink in our locations. And I think you've heard other retailers talk about it, and we certainly have seen it as well. I want to start with, our priority has always been and will remain the safety of our people, whether that's the pandemic, whether that is unruly customers, whether that is outright theft, which is a great deal of what we're seeing right now, and this is a real issue that hurts and scares real people. We are doing a number of things to protect our people and our customers. We are - as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we are finding ways where we can lock up product but still make that a good customer experience. In some instances, we're hiring security. We're working with our vendors on creative ways we can stage the product. We're working with trade organizations. But you can see that pressure in our financials. And more importantly, frankly, you can see that pressure our associates. This is traumatizing for our associates and is unacceptable. We are doing everything we can to try to create as safe as possible environments. Thank you, Anthony. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Liz. We have been really focused on this idea that tech could be instrumental in helping people age more comfortably in their homes for quite a while. It started with our purchase of a GreatCall a few years ago. And part of the reason that we brought GreatCall on board is they had massive experience in dealing with an aging population. And specifically to your question, targeting the right messages to the right people, which is not just targeting the aging population, it's also targeting caregivers who may be looking for some of this product. And so you've seen us over time. We established a relationship with AARP back in March of 2020 as one of our venues. We have a lot of actually, in this space, direct mail and direct targeting because for the populations that we're looking at here, those are some of the most effective means that we have. And then over time, I think you're going to see some of our more broad-based Best Buy messaging, really pointing to the fact that we have a variety of solutions that can help people age in their homes. It's not always just the devices and the care wrappers. Sometimes it's things like a Facebook portal where you can connect with someone on the other side really simply and easily or a device \u2013 you know, a camera and a security system where I can easily lock my door without having to get up or I can keep an eye on that aging loved one. And I think already, you've seen me will continue to see run the gamut of both these very targeted messages to the population that we really want to inform all the way to these kind of more broad-based solution driven messages about what we could help you do to care for a loved one. Well, what's interesting about Totaltech in the aging in place scenario is that, it is more important than ever that your technology works for you if you're relying on it for your safety or if you're a caregiver if you're relying on it for the safety of others. And so the support wrapper around all of the things that we're talking about in health is important. And it also will help, obviously, this population, whether it's the caregiver again or the person being cared for, add more devices, feel comfortable adding devices. We can go to your own and help you install those, and then we can keep them up and running, and I think that's really important. In terms of the KPIs that we look at, it's really true across Totaltech. We're looking for things like increased frequency of interactions. And that may be everything from browsing on the website all the way to coming in the store and making an actual purchase. We're looking for stickiness of that consumer, meaning they're more willing to come back Best Buy bigger share of wallet, more purchase behavior with Best Buy over the longer term. And that will be true whether we're talking about aging in place or whether we're talking about the other aspects of Totaltech. And then obviously, we're going to look for customer satisfaction and engagement with the brand and really trying to almost surprise and delight and over deliver wherever we can for these paying members. You bit. Thanks, Liz. Thank you. And Brian, I think this is why in this space, we continue to really invest in the experience because our ability to deliver on some of those more premium items in the assortment is really distinctive and different. And so this investment - and this is a great example of the investment in the experience is not just for today, but it's so that we continue to represent the premium side of the business over the longer term. Thank you. And Greg, I would just underscore something Matt said in his prepared remarks, we were unduly light last year in inventory. And that's why we're going back to the 2 year \u2013 2 year stack growth of right in that 13% range and then inventory 2 year in that same range. So I just think last year is not a great indicator because I think everyone was looking - we certainly were looking for more last year. Just one more little bit of color and again, at it in his remarks, but this will be the first full quarter of Totaltech too. And so you'll start to see that go through into next year as you get into those other quarters. So that makes it a little different this year comparing Q4 to the rest of the course. But everything Matt said in the rest of it. I mean, our goal would actually be a little bit more even business throughout the year, ultimately. So I'll start with virtual store. Obviously, really early into this, so we're really just getting our legs under is. So it's hard for me to say whether or not there's more than one. The nice part is you should be able to get very good from one location in a model like this, right. Because you can flexibly queue people and you can move them through at your own speed, and you could do this across all the departments in this kind of fake store that's virtual. So I don't think this is going to be about a ton of virtual stores throughout the network. I think it's going to be about scale with a few locations that can provide some interesting use cases. Because truthfully, it's not just about the customer use cases where they might find the virtual store where they're doing digital shopping. It also could be about employee use cases, where I might be in the car installation area and may not have the expertise, but I could zoom right into one of our installation, our Autotech experts who could help you in the moment even as an employee, it gives you a lot of confidence there, too. So I think what we want to find out right now is what are the use cases? How often is it being used? And then ultimately, what does that customer experience look like? But like we said in the prepared remarks, we'd like what we're seeing early. And we'll see just how far you can stretch this kind of one asset that we have right now. In terms of flexible labor, absolutely, it is helpful for us in this environment, and it's helpful on a couple of levels. One, the customer shopping behaviors have changed and they continue to change and they can change week-to-week depending on how important something like speed is as an example. Like the week before Christmas, in-store pickup curbside will become very important assets. And with a more flexible model, I can move employees and employees can being moved to different areas in the store. That means they can pick up more hours or potentially more flexible hours. The other thing that hasn't been brought to light as much as there still are many people calling in sick, which we want. If they're not feeling well, we want them to stay home. A model like this allows you to much more flexibly cover for those call offs. So it's not just about hiring and retention. It's actually about how can I move the labor around the store in the most flexible way. And then the last thing I would say is we have more employees than ever in the history of the company that are skilled in multiple areas in the store. And that isn't just about us flexibly leveraging that labor. That is about them opting into potentially schedules and even in some cases, pay grades that meets whatever they want to try to accomplish in their lives. And that's really for the employee the more positive side of the flexible arrangement and ultimately adding to more confidence in their capabilities and their interactions with customers. That's why we tend to see higher NPS correlate very highly with multiple skill sets. Thank you. Yeah. And just to underscore, I think you'll continue to see product innovation at an accelerated pace. And you will see CE proliferate into other areas like you're seeing it proliferate into health care or even into outdoor spaces. And so I think that makes it even harder for us to answer the question because it's not even just about how you define the market. It's about how the market, in essence, expands over time because it taps into new areas. And that's the part that really has us excited for the future even if to Matt's point, there might be a bumpy quarter here or there. It's really the sustainability of CE as an ever-evolving space from here on out. And with that, I want to thank all of you so much for joining us today, and I know it's a very busy earnings season, so we appreciate it. And happy holidays to all of you, and we look forward to seeing you in March."

Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO, and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors. bestbuy.com.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q2 financial results of $11.8 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98. Comparable sales growth was 20% and our non-GAAP operating income growth was 40%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year, as our stores were limited to curbside service or in-store appointments for roughly half the quarter. When we compare to two years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the second quarter of Fiscal '20 revenue is up 24% and our non - GAAP operating income is up 115%. Clearly, customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remains very strong. Customers continue to leverage technology to meet their needs. And we provided solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home. The demand was also bolstered by an overall strong consumer spending aided by government stimulus, improving wages, and high savings levels.  From a merchandising perspective, we saw a strong comparable sales growth in almost all categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones, and services. Product availability improved in the quarter, and except for some pockets in appliances and home theater, we do not believe it materially limited our overall sales growth. Our merchant, demand planning, and supply chain teams once again did an amazing job managing through the difficult and constantly evolving supply-chain environment.  They worked strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the quarter, with actions like acquiring additional transportation, pulling up product flow, and adjusting store assortment based on availability. There will continue to be challenges, particularly as it relates to congested ports and transportation disruptions, but our teams have set us up for as strong an inventory position as possible as we move forward into the back half of the year. As we think about the holiday period, we often have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges, and this year will be no different. But we feel confident in our ability to serve our customers during the holiday. But continued strong demand across retail resulted in an overall less promotional environment, which was a significant driver of our better-than-expected profitability in the quarter. During the quarter, we provided customers multiple ways to interact with us depending on their needs, preference, and comfort. Similar to last quarter, customers migrated back into stores to touch and feel products and to seek in-person expertise and service. At the same time, they continue to interact with us digitally at a significantly higher rate than pre-pandemic as online sales were 32% of domestic revenues compared to 16% in Q2 of fiscal '20.  Phone and chat volume also remained very high compared to pre-pandemic and sales via these channels continue to decline. In addition, of course, we are interacting with customers in their homes, making large product deliveries, selling solutions, repairing products, and providing sales consultations. In fact, overall, we are helping our customers with their technology needs in their homes, 20% more than we did 2 years ago in Q2 of Fiscal '20. Through all of these interactions, across all of these touchpoints, 98% of survey customers tell us they feel very safe, which we believe is still incredibly important at this stage in the pandemic. I want to genuinely thank our store and in-home teams, for creating this safe environment for our customers. And for continuing to provide exceptional service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines, and in some cases were disrespectful. For customers purchasing online, we delivered products with speed and convenience. Online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago. Furthermore, we stack up extremely well versus our competition. Using a third-party service, we analyze competitor websites on a daily basis, and we consistently lead in the proportion of one day or less for published shipping time across a sample of higher volume zip codes, and higher demand items. In addition, we leveraged our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q2, we continue to see about 60% of our online revenue fulfilled by stores, including in-store or curbside pickup, ship from store, or Best Buy employees who are delivering the product to customers out of more than 450 of our stores.  The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 42%, similar to last year's second quarter. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly and we remain keenly focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects. In June, we launched an employee sweepstake with more than $100,000 in cash prizes to encourage our team members to get vaccinated.  To show our appreciation for their hard work and ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses at the beginning of the quarter. In summary, our team has delivered incredible results. To all of our associates across the Company, I thank you for your customer obsession, perseverance, and ingenuity. Of course, while we were driving these great Q2 results, we were also looking to the future. During the quarter, we continued to roll out and run several tests and pilots as we determine the best path forward to become an even more customer-centric, digitally focused, and efficient Company.  We believe this is crucial to thriving in a new and different environment where customers expect to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels throughout the shopping journey as they seek inspiration, research, convenience, and support. Last year we introduced a very important membership pilot called Best Buy Beta. As a reminder, it includes unlimited Geek Squad technical support on all of the technology in your home no matter where or when you purchased it, including 24/7 VIP access to dedicated phone and chat teams, that are only available to members. It also includes up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases from Best Buy, free delivery and standard installation, exclusive member pricing, a 60-day extended return window, and free shipping of online orders.  All for $199 per year. The offer is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. It leverages our unique strengths and what we can provide customers that no one else can. The goal is to create a membership experience that customers will love, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives the larger share of CE to spend to Best Buy. We are very excited about this membership offer and we are encouraged by the pilot results. Membership acquisition has exceeded our initial forecast. In addition, data is showing that Beta members interact more frequently and have a higher incremental spend than non-members.  Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our members are skewing younger than our Total Tech Support Membership Program. In addition, our employees love telling customers about the program. We plan to scale the program nationally, in stores and online, at the end of Q3 under the new name Best Buy Total Tech. As part of the national rollout, we will be converting our 3.1 million existing Total Tech Support members to the new program. I want to stress that the goal of the program is for customers to find value in the benefits and use them often.  It is not designed to be a standalone margin-driving service offering, particularly in the near term. In fact, as Matt will discuss later, a full rollout is a near-term investment, which we are confident will be justified with incremental sales growth and long-term customer value. As it relates to our physical stores and operating model, we are continuing to pilot and test many approaches and formats. Specifically, we test how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes, and how we can deliver customer [Indiscernible] supported and engaged workforce. We are not going to outline all of our initiatives today, but I would like to provide a few updates on learning. We have begun implementing the pilot of our new holistic market approach in Charlotte. As we mentioned last quarter, this pilot is designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store. We will be testing and arranging remodeling a number of stores to 15, 25, and 35,000 square foot stores, as well as launching a few [Indiscernible] foot stores. We expect the full rollout of the pilot to span a few quarters either way, including the transition of one store into a new type of outlet. Our current fits large appliance and TV open box product. With this new outlet pilot, we will have open box products from all categories. It will also serve as the hub in a new services repair hub and spoke model we are testing, as well as an auto tech mega [Indiscernible] Of course, the reason we are piloting and testing so much is because we are trying some new unique prototypes, and we need the opportunity to learn and adjust before we roll more broadly. For Minneapolis test stores, were [Indiscernible] to 15,000 square feet to provide more space for fulfillment. We have been making adjustments based on customer and employee feedback. We've reflowed some of the layouts, added signage to help customers understand the changes we are testing, and added assortments in areas like small appliances, printing, and accessories. We will continue to evolve feedback as it relates to 5,000 square foot store pilot. We continue to receive positive feedback from customers and employees on store design and the way we are showcasing products. In addition, year to date, this store generated higher revenue than controlled stores in the double-digit percent range.  Another pilot that we are excited to launch pre-holiday is our virtual store. For this, [Indiscernible] in one of our distribution centers that will have merchandising and products, and will be staffed by dedicated associates, including vendor [Indiscernible], but it will have no physical customers. Instead, customers can interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing, depending on their preference, and be able to see live demos, displays, and physical products. We are excited about the customers. For example, you could be on our dot.com experience, click on a product you like, and be connected via video, to a blue shirt in the Best Buy virtual store, and never leave your living room. Or you could be standing in a store, scan a bar code, and be taken through your phone directly to this virtual store where an associate could answer your question.  From a fulfillment perspective we piloted last year, we're very successful, and we're continuing to iterate on the model. As a reminder, while all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship from store units in a limited number of stores across the country. As we evolve the model overall, we are using fewer stores than last year as hubs. In addition, we have begun remodeling a subset of stores to deliver an even greater portion of the volume, reducing the sales floor square [Indiscernible], packaging, station equipment, and supplies. These 13 locations should be rolled out by holiday and take on about 25% of the national ship-from-store volume. As you would expect, the various tests and pilots are intended to identify how our store portfolio should evolve from the role-based serve to their [Indiscernible] these tests we will develop plans that likely include a rollout of investments in more stores and markets. We have also been evolving our labor model to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. For our employees, we are designing for more choice, flexibility, and career opportunity.  We continue to see momentum with our flexible workforce initiative, which is centered on store employees' expertise to perform roles outside of their primary job function. At the end of July, 80% of our associates [Indiscernible] into different work zones, and 50% of associates have earned four or more jobs. This allows our employees and us to [Indiscernible] in the store and between channels, phone, remote support, or employee product delivery. And very soon we will be able to schedule associates between stores within a market. This flexibility is important for all of our stores going forward, but even more important for our smaller stores with less labor.  This new way of working empowers [Indiscernible] giving them opportunities to learn new skills, broaden their experience jobs. They are equipped to confidently help customers in more ways, and our data is showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. It also gets team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the job performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. We believe our flexible workforce initiatives can add to our ability to attract and retain our employees, particularly in this tight labor market.  And in addition to the training and flexibility we offer, we have also invested significantly in compensation and benefits for our associates. On top of raising our starting wage to $15 last year, we provide a wide array of competitive benefits across many dimensions, including tuition reimbursement, employee product discounts, paid time off for part-time associates, back-up child care, child tutor reimbursement, and many others. Overall, we are operating with a smaller field workforce than we were pre-pandemic, which is very reflective of how the business model has changed. As our online revenue has more than doubled from two years ago, we feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing, and the nature of our customer interaction.  What is most important right now is to continue to learn and iterate. As you can imagine, having a more flexible workforce is a very important component of our operating with a smaller workforce. And technology is crucial to its success as well. In fact, technology is the underpinning to the success of our Company strategy. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate. This fact has been clearly reinforced by all of our pilots. There is a myriad of technology projects in development, but here are just a few examples. We will leverage the electronics sign labels in our stores to make it simpler and more seamless for customers to shop.  Especially in our stores with smaller shopping square footage. Specifically, we are adding messaging to the labels that mimic our Dot.Com experience. In other words, customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store, or in another store nearby. And when it could be delivered and installed. We are also piloting mobile app checkout so that customers, particularly grab-and-go customers, can quickly check out, without needing to interact with an associate. For our virtual store to really come to life seamlessly for our customers, we are building out a new digital communication platform, that will combine multiple systems into one experience for a call, chat, video, and screen sharing.  We put our customers in control of how and when they want to be served across these vehicles. Of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities, like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration, in order to drive scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. Earlier this month, Fast Company named us to its 2021 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators. This is our first time on the list, which recognizes companies that created cultures of innovation despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. During the quarter, we continued to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, in the past year, across fitness and wearables, wellness and health, we have more than doubled our vendor partners and grew our SKU count by more than 150%.  These include [Indiscernible], specifically those focused on conditional health management that helps customers track blood glucose levels, keep tabs on heart data, manage weight, or even help identify allergens in food. Furthermore, we are working with hospitals and care centers to cure-rate health products for their patients on co-branded landing pages. Because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we are also expanding to additional adjacent categories. For example, we have expanded our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more and more consumers look to makeover or upgrade their outdoor spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, to name a few.  Many of these products are available online only as part of our digital-first strategy. All together, they are a small part of our overall business but growing fast as we continue to add to the assortment. In the back half of the year, we expect to add more products in the fitness, beauty, sleep, pain management, vision, hearing, and electric transportation categories. Before I conclude my prepared ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity and our community. During the second quarter, we announced our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses, by 2025.  This pledge includes plans to increase all forms of spending with black, indigenous, and people of color businesses, from nearly every corner of the Company. From how we bring goods and services to stores, to where and how we advertise. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry. In addition, earlier this month, we announced we are investing up to $10 million with brown venture group, a venture capital firm that focuses exclusively on black, Latino, and indigenous technology startups.  The goal of this investment is to help break down the systemic barriers often faced by BIPOC, entrepreneurs, including lack of access to funding, and empowering the next tech generation. To make a difference in our local communities, we are passionate about building out our Teen Tech Center program. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools, and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. We are also building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. During the second quarter, we launched our first-ever opportunity for customers to donate to the Best Buy Foundation in support of teen tech centers. Between July 11th and September 11th, customers can choose to donate when they make a purchase, including at a Best Buy store, bestbuy.com, or the Best Buy app. We also just published our 16th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the Company to have a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers, and communities. In terms of the environment, this past year, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 60% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. And we signed the climate pledge committed to being carbon-neutral by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050.  We also have a robust trade-in program that brings a useful second life to products that might otherwise sit idle in someone's home or end up in a landfill. For products that need to be recycled, we continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., taking back more than 2 billion pounds since 2009. Available on our corporate website, our ESG report also outlines the ways we support our employees and communities. In summary, we have delivered a remarkable first half against a volatile backdrop. I am so proud of the execution of our teams as they continue to safely meet the needs of our customers in ways that I would argue no one else can.  Based on the strength of the business and our expectations for continued customer demand, we are raising our sales outlook for the back half. Of course, the environment as it relates to the pandemic is still rapidly evolving and there is uncertainty as to the associated impact on many important factors, including consumer shopping behavior, the share of wallet on services, like dining and travel, return to the office and return-to-school. Furthermore, we continue to believe the holiday season will remain unique against that backdrop. That being said, our teams have proven they can and will continue to proactively navigate these factors. And they remain ready to respond and adjust the business as the environment potentially changes. Over the longer term, we are fundamentally in a stronger position than we expected to be just two years ago. There has been a dramatic and structural increase in the need for technology. And we now serve a much larger install-base of consumer electronics with customers who have an elevated appetite to upgrade due to constant technology innovation and needs that reflect permanent life changes, like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content.  This is only underscored by the recent Senate passage of the Infrastructure Bill, which will provide even more access to broadband and give us the opportunity to serve the needs of currently under-served communities. Our unique omnichannel assets, including our ability to inspire what is possible across the breadth of CE products, as well as our ability to keep it all working together with the way customers want, truly differentiate us going forward in this new landscape. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt, for details on our results and insights on our outlook for the next quarter and the full year.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. An enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98, an increase of 74% versus last year. Our non - GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 100 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by an 80 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Despite lapping actions to reduce our SG&A and a spend last year, we were able to leverage our SG&A 20 basis points on the higher sales volume. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.47 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS.  As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our stores were closed to customer traffic for about half the quarter, while we were helping customers through our curbside service and in-store appointments. We also made several cost reduction decisions last year to align with the lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and were expecting to continue at that point. As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago, or the second quarter of our Fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 24%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite almost 50 fewer stores, and online revenue growth of almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and adjusting our business model to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 290 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from two years ago. Let me now share a few comments on how our Q2 performance compared to the outlook we shared on our last call. Enterprise comparable sale growth of 20% was above our estimate of approximately 17%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 80 basis points versus last year, compared to our outlook of approximately flat.  As Corie stated, this better-than-expected gross profit rate performance was primarily driven by a more favorable promotional environment. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 18% compared to last year, which was slightly favorable to our outlook of approximately 20% growth. Let me now share more details specific to our second quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $11 billion. Our comparable sales growth was also 21% for the quarter. In recent quarters, our revenue growth has been lower than our comparable sales growth, due to the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. Although that was still true this quarter, that impact was partially offset by revenue growth from stores that were closed for remodel as a result of last year's unrest and fall outside of our comparable sales calculations.  As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside-only operating model during the period. This year, we expect to close approximately 30 U.S. stores compared to roughly 20 closures in each of the last two years. Consistent with our previous practice, we will make every effort to retain the employees from the closing locations. From a monthly cadence perspective, the strongest sales growth was in May. As expected, July's monthly comp was the lowest of the quarter as we lapped the reopening of our stores in June of last year.  Turning now to gross profit, the domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.7%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates, rate leverage from our supply chain costs, and higher profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Overall, the promotional mix and sales discounts for the full quarter were once again lower than the levels we experienced last year. However, our comparisons are now beginning to lap periods of very low promotional activity last year. In July, the overall promotional activity increased versus last year but was still below the levels we experienced during Fiscal '20. Moving next to SG&A.  Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 19% compared to last year, and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were the first higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $100 million, which is partially due to the suspension of our short-term incentive program last year.  Second, higher store payroll costs these changes in our operating model last year. And third, the impact of lapping our COVID-related impacts last year, which resulted in higher costs this year, for advertising expense, medical claims expense, and our 401(K) Company match. Lastly, we increased investments this year in support of our technology initiatives. When comparing to 2 years ago, domestic non - GAAP SG&A increased $94 million and decreased 310 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus Fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, technology investments, and increased variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 8.4% versus 23% last year. The lower Q2 fiscal '22 rate was primarily due to a multi-jurisdiction, multi-year, non-cash benefit from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was 55% higher than last year's comparable period and was 23% higher than our Q2 ending inventory balance from two years ago.  The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. The health of our inventory remains very strong. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the second half of fiscal '22 in our updated assumptions for the full year. As we entered the year, we expected revenue growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap the strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21.  Our original outlook also reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slow during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out. Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending occur, the impact has been less pronounced than we previously anticipated. We now expect our comparable sales growth to be down 3% to flat to last year in the back half, which is a significant improvement from the high single-digit decline we expected entering the year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We continue to be confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment.  For the second half of the year, we expect the non-GAAP gross profit rate to be down approximately 30 basis points to last year, which compares to 60 basis points of expansion in the first half of the year. The primary drivers of the sequential decrease include the impact of rolling out Total Tech, increased promotional activity, and less leverage on our supply chain costs than we experienced in the first half of this year. The gross profit rate pressure of our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer.  This pressure is expected to have a larger impact on our fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Now, I will provide some color specific to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect comparable sales to be in the range of down 3% to down 1% to last year, which is on top of our 23% comparable sales growth in the third quarter of last year. Our revenue growth to start this quarter has been approximately flat to last year for the first three weeks. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate.  From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we're planning dollars to be approximately flat compared to last year. As we expect the lapping of last year's $40 million donations to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation to be largely offset by increased technology investments and higher advertising expenses. Turning to our full-year outlook, we expect the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9%, which compares to the prior outlook of 6% to 7% growth.  The increased expense is primarily due to higher store payroll costs and other variable items associated with the higher sales outlook. In addition, we expect the incentive compensation for the full year to increase by approximately $275 million or at the high end of our previously provided range. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million, and lastly, we expect to spend at least $2.5 billion on share purchases.  In closing, over the last two years, our teams have successfully adapted to various changes to our operating model and a dramatic shift in customer shopping behavior. We have seen a surge in reliance in demand for technology as our customers also adapt to their changing needs. The result is that we now expect our sales will surpass $51 billion this year. That is more than $7 billion of increased sales over a two-year period. Thank you, to all our employees for driving these amazing results. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll move on to our first question from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. I wanted to focus on the pricing and promotional environment. And so maybe I'll just ask my 2 questions together. The first part is, as we think about the price increases that are being passed through here to the consumer, can you provide some context around the magnitude of them and how the industry as a whole is addressing these? Rather -- is everyone passing them through or do you see potential increases in promotional activity? And then the follow-up to that is, as we think about the holiday period, in past years, other competitors utilizing the category to drive traffic during the holiday period. Can you talk about the expectation for holiday as a whole, as it relates to frequency and depth of promotional activity? Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Why don't I start, and then Corie can jump in. I think there's a few questions in there. I -- Overall, what we're seeing was the first half of the year was less promotional, similar to the trends we experienced last year during the pandemic. As we -- as I said in my comments, we are starting to see us lap those periods of very low promotionality.  As in July, we're actually seeing the mix of items on promotion and the discounts associated with promotions are actually higher than last year. So, we're starting to see a bit more return to a promotional level that -- more than last year, but still higher than -- still less promotional than two years ago. And so, we do see that increasing. and over that period of time where promotions have been lower, customers have been essentially paying higher prices because the costs -- we haven't been promoting as much.  And so that's certainly part of the aspect. Also, within pricing, we certainly are seeing a little bit of inflation as well as you look at the prices of goods. In some cases, those are being passed on to consumers. Appliances is an example where there has been increases to the cost of those goods, which the industry is generally passing on.  But overall, inflation hasn't been a bigger part of our ASP increases, it's been more on the promotionality versus inflation has been relatively small impacting the first half. It might be a little bit more in the back half, but I wouldn't expect inflation as it relates to pricing to be as significant.\nCorie Barry: And I would just simply underscore our priority is always to be priced competitively. And that will be the case no matter what's coming through the costing side of things. As we head into holiday, specifically to that part of your question, we said even in the prepared remarks, we would expect the back half to be more promotional, and Matt alluded to July being a little bit of that lead into what we're seeing.  And we would expect the products that we sell to be products that people really want for holiday, and therefore, that environment to heat up correspondingly. And so, that is part of what's embedded in the guide going forward.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. Best of luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move onto our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPeter Keith: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much. Great results here. I was hoping you could flesh out a little more on the membership program. It seems interesting. I guess, for the same price, it's basically upgraded to Total Tech Support. Can you confirm it's going to be at all stores by year-end? And then, the gross margin pressure you're experiencing, is that something that will be ongoing or is it more of an annualized effect the program gets ramped up?\nCorie Barry: Thank you, Peter. I'll start, and then Matt can talk a little bit about financial ramifications. So, what was important to us in beta, was understanding; how can we build on some of what we're learning in Total Tech Support in terms of what our customers love, but add onto that what we think will continue to provide them value over time. Like many membership programs are just continuing to evolve based on what we're learning distinctly from our customers.  And so, we started testing data actually just at the very beginning of this fiscal year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're definitely seeing uptake that is greater than both what we expected, greater than what we were seeing in Total Tech support, and I think it's the combination of features that we talked about in the prepared remarks, that are making our customers come to us more frequently.  And like we also said, spend a bit more each time that they're coming to see us because you have this combination that keeps customers very sticky to the Best Buy brand. And so, this is really an evolution of what we have learned in Total Tech Support. Started testing in the very beginning of this year and then we plan to actually roll out towards the end of Q3.  So it will be in place, like Matt said, and have a bigger impact for Q4. But the key for us is that we expect the membership to grow faster than what we saw in TTS. And we've seen that play out in the pilot, and we're going to keep iterating on the offers, frankly, depending on what it is that customers really value and what it is that keeps them loving our brand and very loyal to the brand. I'll let Matt talk a little bit about the financial implications.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you. Thanks for the question, Peter. Essentially, as you would imagine, the Total Tech offer is just far more inclusive to of -- to the benefits to our customers. And so, with that, you're seeing more costs associated with Total Tech. It just has more enhanced benefits than what we had offering in TTS. And that is essentially driving the gross margin profit -- gross margin impact in the back half of this year. The intent of Total Tech is not to actually drive margin rate. The intent of Total Tech is for us to increase sales and therefore leverage more sales into the future. So, the short-term impact certainly is going to be a gross profit rate impact. As you look forward, the intent is for not to be gross profit accretive because what we want people to do is to use it more.  That usage will create more sales and create more leverage on our bottom line in the future. And that's the overall take, but as you would imagine, the enhanced spend do come with more cost, but we believe that will keep people secure and coming back and increase our share at wall with them.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Sounds great. Thanks for the feedback.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Do the guidance now include the expectations that your comps could be flatten down in the second half of this year versus last year? You've previously assumed that it could be more down-high single-digits. It sounds like the difference being that consumers have yet to really shift their wallet to the categories that you expected, do you think this reflects some permanent change in behavior or it's going to happen, it's just that it's not going to happen in the second half of the year and it's going to be more like a 2022 event?  And can you also give us an indication how you factored in any sort of composition of your inventory in the back half, meaning, while up significantly overall, are there any areas where you might be a little short on inventory that will lead to some out of stocks when you factor that into the flat down 2%?\nCorie Barry: So, I will start particularly on the wallet shift question. We noted in the prepared remarks that we definitely are seeing that shift happen slower than what we thought. And it's less than a shift, it's actually been -- for a while, we're seeing growth in both sides. And as Matt said, as the pandemic has redoubled its efforts, we've seen it shifting away a little bit from some of the experiences, that we've just seen this growth continue honestly, in both experiences and on the retail side. I think we're pragmatic and we've said in the prepared remarks, we believe at some point that shift will continue to happen. I think it is being pushed out a bit.  But importantly, there are also systemic changes that have happened in the way that all of us live, right? If you think about something like hybrid work models, that's not just something that's going to happen in the back half or in a quarter. That is likely a new way of working going forward, or streaming, and the amount of streaming content. That's not just in the moment change, that is a change in how people will consume content going forward. And so, I think honestly you have a little bit of both sides here.  You have real systemic changes that have happened in the way that we live. And there's, I think, a push out in people really shifting hard that spending to experiences. And then part of that is being how healthy the consumer is in terms of, still, savings rates that are at all-time highs and very healthy balance sheets, access to credit, and all of those fundamentals staying really solid, I think is helping buoy this demand across both experiences and retail.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, I'll just add a little bit. Corie did a great job explaining the consumer side of that. I think, overall, as you talked about, we are now expecting flat to down 3% in the back half, and that's much better than we had expected at the end of last quarter, which was more closer to down approximately 8%. I think one of the things I would add to that situation is inventory. We feel like we're in a good spot as we look to the back half of this year. I think you asked about inventory.  We are still seeing pockets of inventory, but quite honestly, we are really healthy, strong position, and are preparing ourselves very well for the holiday season. So that clearly adds to our optimism to the back half as well. They are also a lot of uncertainties as you look at it, but we'll update people as we go.\nMichael Lasser: And my follow-up question is on the promotional environment and gross margins. You've mentioned that July, you saw promotions higher than they were in 2020, but still down from where they were in 2019, so how do you factor in your gross margin expectations for the next couple of quarters, where the promotional environment's going to be.  Will it still be higher than or below 2019? And under what conditions could you see some of the other players in the space as it become more promotional than they were in 2019, especially if sales really start to slow at a greater rate than you're expecting?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, I think overall we're always going to be very aware of what our competitors are doing in the back half, whether it's back-to-school or the holiday season, so we'll always be prepared to adjust as appropriately. We are very thoughtful about how we compete and where we compete, in being thoughtful managers of the P&L, if you will.  But overall, I would say, the promotionality we would say probably a little bit higher than what we experienced last year or fiscal '21, but still less promotional than we saw in fiscal '20 starting right now. Again, we'll look at that and manage it as it comes and as we see the holiday unfolds a little bit. But because we were fundamentally always be competitive, but I think, generally, will be more promotional than last year, probably less promotional than two years ago.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you, very much and good luck.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will take our next question from Karen Short of Barclays, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions to clarify. First of all, on the gross margin. So, it's fair to say that, with respect to the roll out of Best Buy Total Tech, that that will pressure gross margins from Q1 through Q3 of next year. That's just a clarification. And then my bigger picture question was, when you think about the overall higher installed base of consumer electronics since this pandemic began.  Wondering if you could give a little color on how you actually see the acceleration in the innovation cycle playing out, meaning obviously we'll have shorter and shorter life cycles leading to need to upgrade more frequently, but I'm wondering if you could just contextualize that a little bit.\nMatt Bilunas: Thanks for the question, Karen. Yes, I will start and then Corie can jump in on the last part of the question. We're not ready to guide next year yet, but so certainly we are expecting Total Tech to pressure Q3 of this year and Q4 of this year as we roll it out. As you can appreciate, we're still trying to understand usage at a roll out level.  And so, it's a little early for us to talk about where -- how long that pressure will exist and in what line of the P&L. As I said, the goal is for it not to actually be accretive to margins. It's supposed to be used, and with that usage will come more costs, but overall, we do expect it to grow our sales over a long term and increase our improve our experiences. It's a bit early to tell how that impacts for next year, but we'll obviously update people as we learn more.\nCorie Barry: On the question of install bases, it's my favorite question, we definitely are seeing more penetration of goods because people have consumer electronics from multiple locations, and use cases, in their lives. In a hybrid work model, I might have one setup at home. I might have one setup and [Indiscernible] go. And so, you've seen this deeper penetration then, of people's homes and lives.  What's interesting about that is what you hit on in terms of innovation, [Indiscernible] companies that have both benefited from that deeper penetration in yield to innovate in a way that will inspire customers to replace replacement cycles condensing that are coming online that are really useful to people.  I mean, if you think about the evolution of just cameras in computers over the last year because so many people are using video, now you've got cameras that track you, even [Indiscernible] going to be this constant drive features and attributes that you add to [Indiscernible].  And really what's fascinating is based on survey data that we're looking at right now, intent to purchase still remains very high in the next 12-month window, which to us says, you've got people who already are trying to think about what might be the more upgrade that's going to help me live at home schooling or another extended period of working from home.  While these are really difficult numbers to [Indiscernible], we are for sure seeing [Indiscernible] looking for those new attributes. And then importantly, vendor partners who are really working harder to create that next suite of solutions that will [Indiscernible] really fundamental structural changes in how we're living our lives.\nKaren Short: Great, thanks.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: We now move on to our next question from Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrad Thomas: Hi, good morning. Great quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you think about categories. I see in 2Q very strong results on a 1 and 2-year basis across the board. With comps having slowed to be declining in the [Indiscernible] that are going to be strongest in weakness. Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: I think there's a lot of categories that will continue [Indiscernible] be upon the levels of inventory that we receive. Appliances has been a category, both large and small, have been growing for years at a time. So, we just see more opportunities there. Clearly, a home theater has opportunities as it always does in the back of the holiday season.  So those are some of the bigger ones. I think computing might be an area where it might be a little bit -- it might be slower based add over the last several years going back, but there are a number of categories that will continue to grow.\nCorie Barry: New category and new product introductions. Both the new categories that we talked about that we're expanding into. While not as big, definitely as likely some new product launches stimulate back to the question about constant innovation that always stimulate a little bit of demand as well.\nBrad Thomas: Great, and Corie, if you could tell us a bit -- a longer-term [Indiscernible]\nCorie Barry: Technology. The second area is all about emergency response device-based tools back in our homes. And that builds on some of acquisitions that we've already seen. Then the third, which is a little bit more nascent is [Indiscernible] digital health caring center services that can connect patients and physicians to enable [Indiscernible].  That one is the most nascent, and that one will take the longest to develop. On the first two, you can hear even our prepared remarks, the unmet, proliferating right now to help people manage their our own care is absolutely incredible, and so on the consumer side, we feel really strong [Indiscernible] dependency that business rebound, especially as we're starting to see more people come back into our stores, and I think the assets as you think about virtual carriers, we've all gone through.  And that [Indiscernible] person hospital does it, but instead be able [Indiscernible] I think, obviously, there's an even greater use case now than there was [Indiscernible] that together, I think broadly we remain really optimistic about how the future of healthcare can be changed through technology and the role that we can play in it it.\nBrad Thomas: Really helpful. Thank you so much.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move onto our next question from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: My question is, I had to get my arms a little bit better around that for [Indiscernible] it looked like from an inventory perspective, from a margin perspective, it just seems in the fourth quarter there is always a challenge, but I was wondering if you'd give us a little bit more what you're thinking there. [Indiscernible] question as well. And I'll start that later.\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah, thanks. We've jump on the last part there. I think we're very confident that we're [Indiscernible] demand of our customers. There's always a level of constrained inventory when you are still seeing pockets of constrained now. We are in a very health -- more in certain areas, but we have a high degree as we've talked about, transfer ability between categories and within category assortment to meet customers' demand.  I think, overall, from a gross profit perspective, one of the -- we did talk about how we expect to see gross profit rate pressure in Q4. The total picture, we will see probably more return to more promotionality compared to last year, but again, overall, compared to two years ago, it should be less. But again, we'll watch and see where it goes and adjust accordingly.\nScott Mushkin: Great, I appreciate the color. And then my second question is what you guys talked about with the whole, again, just looking for a little bit more detail. Are you guys going to be remodeling on there, when we will it be complete? Any more details around that. That sounds very exciting.\nCorie Barry: Yeah. I am [Indiscernible] because I think it uniquely [Indiscernible] across both our physical assets, our stores, seeing every single store, there will be a number of remodels, but it's not every single one, but it also [Indiscernible] our consultants and designers and advisors in our stores, and leverage them across not just conventional storefronts, but also in places like an outlet, or in places like an auto [Indiscernible] or ten auto base, where you can work on all the cars together as an example.  And we said in the [Indiscernible] role everything out in the market, all the model changes that go with that as you learn how to more flexibly operate all of these models. But the goal for us is balancing that -- this isn't just about like quantity of stores, this is [Indiscernible] to do for you, and then the operating model and the people flexibly working around that physical footprint in a way that uniquely provides [Indiscernible] customers both that inspiration and [Indiscernible] no one else can.  And so, I [Indiscernible] on one concept, but trying to put all the concepts together and say if I want to serve a market, how I help a customer navigate different Best Buy experiences, and also help our employees work more flexibly across all those experiences. With --\nScott Mushkin: -- guys on the incredible job, given what's been thrown at you, so -- next work.\nCorie Barry: Thank you very much.\nScott Mushkin: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: So, I just want to close by saying, thank you [Indiscernible] being associates and thank you all so much for joining us today. [Indiscernible] our progress during our next call coming up in November. Have a great day",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. An enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98, an increase of 74% versus last year. Our non - GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 100 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by an 80 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Despite lapping actions to reduce our SG&A and a spend last year, we were able to leverage our SG&A 20 basis points on the higher sales volume. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.47 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS.  As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our stores were closed to customer traffic for about half the quarter, while we were helping customers through our curbside service and in-store appointments. We also made several cost reduction decisions last year to align with the lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and were expecting to continue at that point. As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago, or the second quarter of our Fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 24%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite almost 50 fewer stores, and online revenue growth of almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and adjusting our business model to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 290 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from two years ago. Let me now share a few comments on how our Q2 performance compared to the outlook we shared on our last call. Enterprise comparable sale growth of 20% was above our estimate of approximately 17%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 80 basis points versus last year, compared to our outlook of approximately flat.  As Corie stated, this better-than-expected gross profit rate performance was primarily driven by a more favorable promotional environment. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 18% compared to last year, which was slightly favorable to our outlook of approximately 20% growth. Let me now share more details specific to our second quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $11 billion. Our comparable sales growth was also 21% for the quarter. In recent quarters, our revenue growth has been lower than our comparable sales growth, due to the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. Although that was still true this quarter, that impact was partially offset by revenue growth from stores that were closed for remodel as a result of last year's unrest and fall outside of our comparable sales calculations.  As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside-only operating model during the period. This year, we expect to close approximately 30 U.S. stores compared to roughly 20 closures in each of the last two years. Consistent with our previous practice, we will make every effort to retain the employees from the closing locations. From a monthly cadence perspective, the strongest sales growth was in May. As expected, July's monthly comp was the lowest of the quarter as we lapped the reopening of our stores in June of last year.  Turning now to gross profit, the domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.7%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates, rate leverage from our supply chain costs, and higher profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Overall, the promotional mix and sales discounts for the full quarter were once again lower than the levels we experienced last year. However, our comparisons are now beginning to lap periods of very low promotional activity last year. In July, the overall promotional activity increased versus last year but was still below the levels we experienced during Fiscal '20. Moving next to SG&A.  Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 19% compared to last year, and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were the first higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $100 million, which is partially due to the suspension of our short-term incentive program last year.  Second, higher store payroll costs these changes in our operating model last year. And third, the impact of lapping our COVID-related impacts last year, which resulted in higher costs this year, for advertising expense, medical claims expense, and our 401(K) Company match. Lastly, we increased investments this year in support of our technology initiatives. When comparing to 2 years ago, domestic non - GAAP SG&A increased $94 million and decreased 310 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus Fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, technology investments, and increased variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 8.4% versus 23% last year. The lower Q2 fiscal '22 rate was primarily due to a multi-jurisdiction, multi-year, non-cash benefit from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was 55% higher than last year's comparable period and was 23% higher than our Q2 ending inventory balance from two years ago.  The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. The health of our inventory remains very strong. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the second half of fiscal '22 in our updated assumptions for the full year. As we entered the year, we expected revenue growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap the strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21.  Our original outlook also reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slow during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out. Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending occur, the impact has been less pronounced than we previously anticipated. We now expect our comparable sales growth to be down 3% to flat to last year in the back half, which is a significant improvement from the high single-digit decline we expected entering the year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We continue to be confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment.  For the second half of the year, we expect the non-GAAP gross profit rate to be down approximately 30 basis points to last year, which compares to 60 basis points of expansion in the first half of the year. The primary drivers of the sequential decrease include the impact of rolling out Total Tech, increased promotional activity, and less leverage on our supply chain costs than we experienced in the first half of this year. The gross profit rate pressure of our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer.  This pressure is expected to have a larger impact on our fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Now, I will provide some color specific to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect comparable sales to be in the range of down 3% to down 1% to last year, which is on top of our 23% comparable sales growth in the third quarter of last year. Our revenue growth to start this quarter has been approximately flat to last year for the first three weeks. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate.  From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we're planning dollars to be approximately flat compared to last year. As we expect the lapping of last year's $40 million donations to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation to be largely offset by increased technology investments and higher advertising expenses. Turning to our full-year outlook, we expect the following: enterprise revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9%, which compares to the prior outlook of 6% to 7% growth.  The increased expense is primarily due to higher store payroll costs and other variable items associated with the higher sales outlook. In addition, we expect the incentive compensation for the full year to increase by approximately $275 million or at the high end of our previously provided range. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million, and lastly, we expect to spend at least $2.5 billion on share purchases.  In closing, over the last two years, our teams have successfully adapted to various changes to our operating model and a dramatic shift in customer shopping behavior. We have seen a surge in reliance in demand for technology as our customers also adapt to their changing needs. The result is that we now expect our sales will surpass $51 billion this year. That is more than $7 billion of increased sales over a two-year period. Thank you, to all our employees for driving these amazing results. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Why don't I start, and then Corie can jump in. I think there's a few questions in there. I -- Overall, what we're seeing was the first half of the year was less promotional, similar to the trends we experienced last year during the pandemic. As we -- as I said in my comments, we are starting to see us lap those periods of very low promotionality.  As in July, we're actually seeing the mix of items on promotion and the discounts associated with promotions are actually higher than last year. So, we're starting to see a bit more return to a promotional level that -- more than last year, but still higher than -- still less promotional than two years ago. And so, we do see that increasing. and over that period of time where promotions have been lower, customers have been essentially paying higher prices because the costs -- we haven't been promoting as much.  And so that's certainly part of the aspect. Also, within pricing, we certainly are seeing a little bit of inflation as well as you look at the prices of goods. In some cases, those are being passed on to consumers. Appliances is an example where there has been increases to the cost of those goods, which the industry is generally passing on.  But overall, inflation hasn't been a bigger part of our ASP increases, it's been more on the promotionality versus inflation has been relatively small impacting the first half. It might be a little bit more in the back half, but I wouldn't expect inflation as it relates to pricing to be as significant. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Peter. Essentially, as you would imagine, the Total Tech offer is just far more inclusive to of -- to the benefits to our customers. And so, with that, you're seeing more costs associated with Total Tech. It just has more enhanced benefits than what we had offering in TTS. And that is essentially driving the gross margin profit -- gross margin impact in the back half of this year. The intent of Total Tech is not to actually drive margin rate. The intent of Total Tech is for us to increase sales and therefore leverage more sales into the future. So, the short-term impact certainly is going to be a gross profit rate impact. As you look forward, the intent is for not to be gross profit accretive because what we want people to do is to use it more.  That usage will create more sales and create more leverage on our bottom line in the future. And that's the overall take, but as you would imagine, the enhanced spend do come with more cost, but we believe that will keep people secure and coming back and increase our share at wall with them. Yes, I'll just add a little bit. Corie did a great job explaining the consumer side of that. I think, overall, as you talked about, we are now expecting flat to down 3% in the back half, and that's much better than we had expected at the end of last quarter, which was more closer to down approximately 8%. I think one of the things I would add to that situation is inventory. We feel like we're in a good spot as we look to the back half of this year. I think you asked about inventory.  We are still seeing pockets of inventory, but quite honestly, we are really healthy, strong position, and are preparing ourselves very well for the holiday season. So that clearly adds to our optimism to the back half as well. They are also a lot of uncertainties as you look at it, but we'll update people as we go. Yes, I think overall we're always going to be very aware of what our competitors are doing in the back half, whether it's back-to-school or the holiday season, so we'll always be prepared to adjust as appropriately. We are very thoughtful about how we compete and where we compete, in being thoughtful managers of the P&L, if you will.  But overall, I would say, the promotionality we would say probably a little bit higher than what we experienced last year or fiscal '21, but still less promotional than we saw in fiscal '20 starting right now. Again, we'll look at that and manage it as it comes and as we see the holiday unfolds a little bit. But because we were fundamentally always be competitive, but I think, generally, will be more promotional than last year, probably less promotional than two years ago. Thank you. Thanks for the question, Karen. Yes, I will start and then Corie can jump in on the last part of the question. We're not ready to guide next year yet, but so certainly we are expecting Total Tech to pressure Q3 of this year and Q4 of this year as we roll it out. As you can appreciate, we're still trying to understand usage at a roll out level.  And so, it's a little early for us to talk about where -- how long that pressure will exist and in what line of the P&L. As I said, the goal is for it not to actually be accretive to margins. It's supposed to be used, and with that usage will come more costs, but overall, we do expect it to grow our sales over a long term and increase our improve our experiences. It's a bit early to tell how that impacts for next year, but we'll obviously update people as we learn more. I think there's a lot of categories that will continue [Indiscernible] be upon the levels of inventory that we receive. Appliances has been a category, both large and small, have been growing for years at a time. So, we just see more opportunities there. Clearly, a home theater has opportunities as it always does in the back of the holiday season.  So those are some of the bigger ones. I think computing might be an area where it might be a little bit -- it might be slower based add over the last several years going back, but there are a number of categories that will continue to grow. Yeah, thanks. We've jump on the last part there. I think we're very confident that we're [Indiscernible] demand of our customers. There's always a level of constrained inventory when you are still seeing pockets of constrained now. We are in a very health -- more in certain areas, but we have a high degree as we've talked about, transfer ability between categories and within category assortment to meet customers' demand.  I think, overall, from a gross profit perspective, one of the -- we did talk about how we expect to see gross profit rate pressure in Q4. The total picture, we will see probably more return to more promotionality compared to last year, but again, overall, compared to two years ago, it should be less. But again, we'll watch and see where it goes and adjust accordingly."

Today, we are reporting record Q2 financial results of $11.8 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98. Comparable sales growth was 20% and our non-GAAP operating income growth was 40%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year, as our stores were limited to curbside service or in-store appointments for roughly half the quarter. When we compare to two years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the second quarter of Fiscal '20 revenue is up 24% and our non - GAAP operating income is up 115%. Clearly, customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remains very strong. Customers continue to leverage technology to meet their needs. And we provided solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home. The demand was also bolstered by an overall strong consumer spending aided by government stimulus, improving wages, and high savings levels.  From a merchandising perspective, we saw a strong comparable sales growth in almost all categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones, and services. Product availability improved in the quarter, and except for some pockets in appliances and home theater, we do not believe it materially limited our overall sales growth. Our merchant, demand planning, and supply chain teams once again did an amazing job managing through the difficult and constantly evolving supply-chain environment.  They worked strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the quarter, with actions like acquiring additional transportation, pulling up product flow, and adjusting store assortment based on availability. There will continue to be challenges, particularly as it relates to congested ports and transportation disruptions, but our teams have set us up for as strong an inventory position as possible as we move forward into the back half of the year. As we think about the holiday period, we often have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges, and this year will be no different. But we feel confident in our ability to serve our customers during the holiday. But continued strong demand across retail resulted in an overall less promotional environment, which was a significant driver of our better-than-expected profitability in the quarter. During the quarter, we provided customers multiple ways to interact with us depending on their needs, preference, and comfort. Similar to last quarter, customers migrated back into stores to touch and feel products and to seek in-person expertise and service. At the same time, they continue to interact with us digitally at a significantly higher rate than pre-pandemic as online sales were 32% of domestic revenues compared to 16% in Q2 of fiscal '20.  Phone and chat volume also remained very high compared to pre-pandemic and sales via these channels continue to decline. In addition, of course, we are interacting with customers in their homes, making large product deliveries, selling solutions, repairing products, and providing sales consultations. In fact, overall, we are helping our customers with their technology needs in their homes, 20% more than we did 2 years ago in Q2 of Fiscal '20. Through all of these interactions, across all of these touchpoints, 98% of survey customers tell us they feel very safe, which we believe is still incredibly important at this stage in the pandemic. I want to genuinely thank our store and in-home teams, for creating this safe environment for our customers. And for continuing to provide exceptional service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines, and in some cases were disrespectful. For customers purchasing online, we delivered products with speed and convenience. Online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago. Furthermore, we stack up extremely well versus our competition. Using a third-party service, we analyze competitor websites on a daily basis, and we consistently lead in the proportion of one day or less for published shipping time across a sample of higher volume zip codes, and higher demand items. In addition, we leveraged our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q2, we continue to see about 60% of our online revenue fulfilled by stores, including in-store or curbside pickup, ship from store, or Best Buy employees who are delivering the product to customers out of more than 450 of our stores.  The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 42%, similar to last year's second quarter. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly and we remain keenly focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects. In June, we launched an employee sweepstake with more than $100,000 in cash prizes to encourage our team members to get vaccinated.  To show our appreciation for their hard work and ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses at the beginning of the quarter. In summary, our team has delivered incredible results. To all of our associates across the Company, I thank you for your customer obsession, perseverance, and ingenuity. Of course, while we were driving these great Q2 results, we were also looking to the future. During the quarter, we continued to roll out and run several tests and pilots as we determine the best path forward to become an even more customer-centric, digitally focused, and efficient Company.  We believe this is crucial to thriving in a new and different environment where customers expect to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels throughout the shopping journey as they seek inspiration, research, convenience, and support. Last year we introduced a very important membership pilot called Best Buy Beta. As a reminder, it includes unlimited Geek Squad technical support on all of the technology in your home no matter where or when you purchased it, including 24/7 VIP access to dedicated phone and chat teams, that are only available to members. It also includes up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases from Best Buy, free delivery and standard installation, exclusive member pricing, a 60-day extended return window, and free shipping of online orders.  All for $199 per year. The offer is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. It leverages our unique strengths and what we can provide customers that no one else can. The goal is to create a membership experience that customers will love, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives the larger share of CE to spend to Best Buy. We are very excited about this membership offer and we are encouraged by the pilot results. Membership acquisition has exceeded our initial forecast. In addition, data is showing that Beta members interact more frequently and have a higher incremental spend than non-members.  Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our members are skewing younger than our Total Tech Support Membership Program. In addition, our employees love telling customers about the program. We plan to scale the program nationally, in stores and online, at the end of Q3 under the new name Best Buy Total Tech. As part of the national rollout, we will be converting our 3.1 million existing Total Tech Support members to the new program. I want to stress that the goal of the program is for customers to find value in the benefits and use them often.  It is not designed to be a standalone margin-driving service offering, particularly in the near term. In fact, as Matt will discuss later, a full rollout is a near-term investment, which we are confident will be justified with incremental sales growth and long-term customer value. As it relates to our physical stores and operating model, we are continuing to pilot and test many approaches and formats. Specifically, we test how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes, and how we can deliver customer [Indiscernible] supported and engaged workforce. We are not going to outline all of our initiatives today, but I would like to provide a few updates on learning. We have begun implementing the pilot of our new holistic market approach in Charlotte. As we mentioned last quarter, this pilot is designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store. We will be testing and arranging remodeling a number of stores to 15, 25, and 35,000 square foot stores, as well as launching a few [Indiscernible] foot stores. We expect the full rollout of the pilot to span a few quarters either way, including the transition of one store into a new type of outlet. Our current fits large appliance and TV open box product. With this new outlet pilot, we will have open box products from all categories. It will also serve as the hub in a new services repair hub and spoke model we are testing, as well as an auto tech mega [Indiscernible] Of course, the reason we are piloting and testing so much is because we are trying some new unique prototypes, and we need the opportunity to learn and adjust before we roll more broadly. For Minneapolis test stores, were [Indiscernible] to 15,000 square feet to provide more space for fulfillment. We have been making adjustments based on customer and employee feedback. We've reflowed some of the layouts, added signage to help customers understand the changes we are testing, and added assortments in areas like small appliances, printing, and accessories. We will continue to evolve feedback as it relates to 5,000 square foot store pilot. We continue to receive positive feedback from customers and employees on store design and the way we are showcasing products. In addition, year to date, this store generated higher revenue than controlled stores in the double-digit percent range.  Another pilot that we are excited to launch pre-holiday is our virtual store. For this, [Indiscernible] in one of our distribution centers that will have merchandising and products, and will be staffed by dedicated associates, including vendor [Indiscernible], but it will have no physical customers. Instead, customers can interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing, depending on their preference, and be able to see live demos, displays, and physical products. We are excited about the customers. For example, you could be on our dot.com experience, click on a product you like, and be connected via video, to a blue shirt in the Best Buy virtual store, and never leave your living room. Or you could be standing in a store, scan a bar code, and be taken through your phone directly to this virtual store where an associate could answer your question.  From a fulfillment perspective we piloted last year, we're very successful, and we're continuing to iterate on the model. As a reminder, while all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship from store units in a limited number of stores across the country. As we evolve the model overall, we are using fewer stores than last year as hubs. In addition, we have begun remodeling a subset of stores to deliver an even greater portion of the volume, reducing the sales floor square [Indiscernible], packaging, station equipment, and supplies. These 13 locations should be rolled out by holiday and take on about 25% of the national ship-from-store volume. As you would expect, the various tests and pilots are intended to identify how our store portfolio should evolve from the role-based serve to their [Indiscernible] these tests we will develop plans that likely include a rollout of investments in more stores and markets. We have also been evolving our labor model to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. For our employees, we are designing for more choice, flexibility, and career opportunity.  We continue to see momentum with our flexible workforce initiative, which is centered on store employees' expertise to perform roles outside of their primary job function. At the end of July, 80% of our associates [Indiscernible] into different work zones, and 50% of associates have earned four or more jobs. This allows our employees and us to [Indiscernible] in the store and between channels, phone, remote support, or employee product delivery. And very soon we will be able to schedule associates between stores within a market. This flexibility is important for all of our stores going forward, but even more important for our smaller stores with less labor.  This new way of working empowers [Indiscernible] giving them opportunities to learn new skills, broaden their experience jobs. They are equipped to confidently help customers in more ways, and our data is showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. It also gets team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the job performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. We believe our flexible workforce initiatives can add to our ability to attract and retain our employees, particularly in this tight labor market.  And in addition to the training and flexibility we offer, we have also invested significantly in compensation and benefits for our associates. On top of raising our starting wage to $15 last year, we provide a wide array of competitive benefits across many dimensions, including tuition reimbursement, employee product discounts, paid time off for part-time associates, back-up child care, child tutor reimbursement, and many others. Overall, we are operating with a smaller field workforce than we were pre-pandemic, which is very reflective of how the business model has changed. As our online revenue has more than doubled from two years ago, we feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing, and the nature of our customer interaction.  What is most important right now is to continue to learn and iterate. As you can imagine, having a more flexible workforce is a very important component of our operating with a smaller workforce. And technology is crucial to its success as well. In fact, technology is the underpinning to the success of our Company strategy. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate. This fact has been clearly reinforced by all of our pilots. There is a myriad of technology projects in development, but here are just a few examples. We will leverage the electronics sign labels in our stores to make it simpler and more seamless for customers to shop.  Especially in our stores with smaller shopping square footage. Specifically, we are adding messaging to the labels that mimic our Dot.Com experience. In other words, customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store, or in another store nearby. And when it could be delivered and installed. We are also piloting mobile app checkout so that customers, particularly grab-and-go customers, can quickly check out, without needing to interact with an associate. For our virtual store to really come to life seamlessly for our customers, we are building out a new digital communication platform, that will combine multiple systems into one experience for a call, chat, video, and screen sharing.  We put our customers in control of how and when they want to be served across these vehicles. Of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities, like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration, in order to drive scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. Earlier this month, Fast Company named us to its 2021 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators. This is our first time on the list, which recognizes companies that created cultures of innovation despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. During the quarter, we continued to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, in the past year, across fitness and wearables, wellness and health, we have more than doubled our vendor partners and grew our SKU count by more than 150%.  These include [Indiscernible], specifically those focused on conditional health management that helps customers track blood glucose levels, keep tabs on heart data, manage weight, or even help identify allergens in food. Furthermore, we are working with hospitals and care centers to cure-rate health products for their patients on co-branded landing pages. Because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we are also expanding to additional adjacent categories. For example, we have expanded our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more and more consumers look to makeover or upgrade their outdoor spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, to name a few.  Many of these products are available online only as part of our digital-first strategy. All together, they are a small part of our overall business but growing fast as we continue to add to the assortment. In the back half of the year, we expect to add more products in the fitness, beauty, sleep, pain management, vision, hearing, and electric transportation categories. Before I conclude my prepared ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity and our community. During the second quarter, we announced our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses, by 2025.  This pledge includes plans to increase all forms of spending with black, indigenous, and people of color businesses, from nearly every corner of the Company. From how we bring goods and services to stores, to where and how we advertise. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry. In addition, earlier this month, we announced we are investing up to $10 million with brown venture group, a venture capital firm that focuses exclusively on black, Latino, and indigenous technology startups.  The goal of this investment is to help break down the systemic barriers often faced by BIPOC, entrepreneurs, including lack of access to funding, and empowering the next tech generation. To make a difference in our local communities, we are passionate about building out our Teen Tech Center program. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools, and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. We are also building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. During the second quarter, we launched our first-ever opportunity for customers to donate to the Best Buy Foundation in support of teen tech centers. Between July 11th and September 11th, customers can choose to donate when they make a purchase, including at a Best Buy store, bestbuy.com, or the Best Buy app. We also just published our 16th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the Company to have a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers, and communities. In terms of the environment, this past year, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 60% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. And we signed the climate pledge committed to being carbon-neutral by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050.  We also have a robust trade-in program that brings a useful second life to products that might otherwise sit idle in someone's home or end up in a landfill. For products that need to be recycled, we continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., taking back more than 2 billion pounds since 2009. Available on our corporate website, our ESG report also outlines the ways we support our employees and communities. In summary, we have delivered a remarkable first half against a volatile backdrop. I am so proud of the execution of our teams as they continue to safely meet the needs of our customers in ways that I would argue no one else can.  Based on the strength of the business and our expectations for continued customer demand, we are raising our sales outlook for the back half. Of course, the environment as it relates to the pandemic is still rapidly evolving and there is uncertainty as to the associated impact on many important factors, including consumer shopping behavior, the share of wallet on services, like dining and travel, return to the office and return-to-school. Furthermore, we continue to believe the holiday season will remain unique against that backdrop. That being said, our teams have proven they can and will continue to proactively navigate these factors. And they remain ready to respond and adjust the business as the environment potentially changes. Over the longer term, we are fundamentally in a stronger position than we expected to be just two years ago. There has been a dramatic and structural increase in the need for technology. And we now serve a much larger install-base of consumer electronics with customers who have an elevated appetite to upgrade due to constant technology innovation and needs that reflect permanent life changes, like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content.  This is only underscored by the recent Senate passage of the Infrastructure Bill, which will provide even more access to broadband and give us the opportunity to serve the needs of currently under-served communities. Our unique omnichannel assets, including our ability to inspire what is possible across the breadth of CE products, as well as our ability to keep it all working together with the way customers want, truly differentiate us going forward in this new landscape. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt, for details on our results and insights on our outlook for the next quarter and the full year. And I would just simply underscore our priority is always to be priced competitively. And that will be the case no matter what's coming through the costing side of things. As we head into holiday, specifically to that part of your question, we said even in the prepared remarks, we would expect the back half to be more promotional, and Matt alluded to July being a little bit of that lead into what we're seeing.  And we would expect the products that we sell to be products that people really want for holiday, and therefore, that environment to heat up correspondingly. And so, that is part of what's embedded in the guide going forward. Thank you. Thank you, Peter. I'll start, and then Matt can talk a little bit about financial ramifications. So, what was important to us in beta, was understanding; how can we build on some of what we're learning in Total Tech Support in terms of what our customers love, but add onto that what we think will continue to provide them value over time. Like many membership programs are just continuing to evolve based on what we're learning distinctly from our customers.  And so, we started testing data actually just at the very beginning of this fiscal year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're definitely seeing uptake that is greater than both what we expected, greater than what we were seeing in Total Tech support, and I think it's the combination of features that we talked about in the prepared remarks, that are making our customers come to us more frequently.  And like we also said, spend a bit more each time that they're coming to see us because you have this combination that keeps customers very sticky to the Best Buy brand. And so, this is really an evolution of what we have learned in Total Tech Support. Started testing in the very beginning of this year and then we plan to actually roll out towards the end of Q3.  So it will be in place, like Matt said, and have a bigger impact for Q4. But the key for us is that we expect the membership to grow faster than what we saw in TTS. And we've seen that play out in the pilot, and we're going to keep iterating on the offers, frankly, depending on what it is that customers really value and what it is that keeps them loving our brand and very loyal to the brand. I'll let Matt talk a little bit about the financial implications. Thank you. So, I will start particularly on the wallet shift question. We noted in the prepared remarks that we definitely are seeing that shift happen slower than what we thought. And it's less than a shift, it's actually been -- for a while, we're seeing growth in both sides. And as Matt said, as the pandemic has redoubled its efforts, we've seen it shifting away a little bit from some of the experiences, that we've just seen this growth continue honestly, in both experiences and on the retail side. I think we're pragmatic and we've said in the prepared remarks, we believe at some point that shift will continue to happen. I think it is being pushed out a bit.  But importantly, there are also systemic changes that have happened in the way that all of us live, right? If you think about something like hybrid work models, that's not just something that's going to happen in the back half or in a quarter. That is likely a new way of working going forward, or streaming, and the amount of streaming content. That's not just in the moment change, that is a change in how people will consume content going forward. And so, I think honestly you have a little bit of both sides here.  You have real systemic changes that have happened in the way that we live. And there's, I think, a push out in people really shifting hard that spending to experiences. And then part of that is being how healthy the consumer is in terms of, still, savings rates that are at all-time highs and very healthy balance sheets, access to credit, and all of those fundamentals staying really solid, I think is helping buoy this demand across both experiences and retail. On the question of install bases, it's my favorite question, we definitely are seeing more penetration of goods because people have consumer electronics from multiple locations, and use cases, in their lives. In a hybrid work model, I might have one setup at home. I might have one setup and [Indiscernible] go. And so, you've seen this deeper penetration then, of people's homes and lives.  What's interesting about that is what you hit on in terms of innovation, [Indiscernible] companies that have both benefited from that deeper penetration in yield to innovate in a way that will inspire customers to replace replacement cycles condensing that are coming online that are really useful to people.  I mean, if you think about the evolution of just cameras in computers over the last year because so many people are using video, now you've got cameras that track you, even [Indiscernible] going to be this constant drive features and attributes that you add to [Indiscernible].  And really what's fascinating is based on survey data that we're looking at right now, intent to purchase still remains very high in the next 12-month window, which to us says, you've got people who already are trying to think about what might be the more upgrade that's going to help me live at home schooling or another extended period of working from home.  While these are really difficult numbers to [Indiscernible], we are for sure seeing [Indiscernible] looking for those new attributes. And then importantly, vendor partners who are really working harder to create that next suite of solutions that will [Indiscernible] really fundamental structural changes in how we're living our lives. Thank you. New category and new product introductions. Both the new categories that we talked about that we're expanding into. While not as big, definitely as likely some new product launches stimulate back to the question about constant innovation that always stimulate a little bit of demand as well. Technology. The second area is all about emergency response device-based tools back in our homes. And that builds on some of acquisitions that we've already seen. Then the third, which is a little bit more nascent is [Indiscernible] digital health caring center services that can connect patients and physicians to enable [Indiscernible].  That one is the most nascent, and that one will take the longest to develop. On the first two, you can hear even our prepared remarks, the unmet, proliferating right now to help people manage their our own care is absolutely incredible, and so on the consumer side, we feel really strong [Indiscernible] dependency that business rebound, especially as we're starting to see more people come back into our stores, and I think the assets as you think about virtual carriers, we've all gone through.  And that [Indiscernible] person hospital does it, but instead be able [Indiscernible] I think, obviously, there's an even greater use case now than there was [Indiscernible] that together, I think broadly we remain really optimistic about how the future of healthcare can be changed through technology and the role that we can play in it it. Thank you. Yeah. I am [Indiscernible] because I think it uniquely [Indiscernible] across both our physical assets, our stores, seeing every single store, there will be a number of remodels, but it's not every single one, but it also [Indiscernible] our consultants and designers and advisors in our stores, and leverage them across not just conventional storefronts, but also in places like an outlet, or in places like an auto [Indiscernible] or ten auto base, where you can work on all the cars together as an example.  And we said in the [Indiscernible] role everything out in the market, all the model changes that go with that as you learn how to more flexibly operate all of these models. But the goal for us is balancing that -- this isn't just about like quantity of stores, this is [Indiscernible] to do for you, and then the operating model and the people flexibly working around that physical footprint in a way that uniquely provides [Indiscernible] customers both that inspiration and [Indiscernible] no one else can.  And so, I [Indiscernible] on one concept, but trying to put all the concepts together and say if I want to serve a market, how I help a customer navigate different Best Buy experiences, and also help our employees work more flexibly across all those experiences. With -- Thank you very much. So, I just want to close by saying, thank you [Indiscernible] being associates and thank you all so much for joining us today. [Indiscernible] our progress during our next call coming up in November. Have a great day"

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nMollie O'Brien: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year that included both periods of high demand and periods when our stores were closed to customer traffic. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20, revenue is up 27% and our earnings per share are up more than 100%. Customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter was extraordinarily high. This demand is being driven by continued focus on the home, which encompasses many aspects of our lives, including working, learning, cooking, entertaining, redecorating and remodeling. The demand was also bolstered by government stimulus programs and the strong housing environment. Our teams across the organization met that demand with remarkable execution. From our merchant and supply chain teams working behind the scenes to our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents on the front lines. Our employees once again showed amazing flexibility and execution managing extraordinary volumes. Most importantly, they provided exceptional customer service in a safe environment. From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales across virtually all product and service categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, computing and appliances. With the extraordinarily high customer demand, as well as production and distribution disruptions, product availability constraints continued to be a theme during Q1, as they have been throughout the pandemic, particularly in large appliances, computing, televisions and gaming. Our teams collaborated closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. This is a testament to the trust and unique relationships that our merchants have built with vendors over decades of partnership. Our results this quarter also highlight the strength of our supply chain. We were able to efficiently move the amount of inventory necessary to drive 37% comp sales growth, while navigating record demand across retail, container shortages and port congestion. We also improved our speed to customer, as our online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago pre-pandemic. In fact, same-day delivery to customer\u2019s homes was up 90% on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we continue to leverage our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q1, about 60% of our online revenue was either picked up in store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of our delivery experience. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 44%, similar to last year's first quarter. This strong performance would not have been possible without an amazing and resourceful team of people and the multi-year investments we have made in our supply chain transformation. Best Buy has a unique ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And as the impacts of the pandemic have evolved, customers across all age demographics are feeling more comfortable coming back into stores to see products firsthand, seek expert advice from our associates or get technical support from our Geek Squad agents. At the same time, sales originating online continued to be much higher than pre-pandemic and were 33% of our domestic sales compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. In addition, we continue to innovatively help customers via phone and chat. We learned a great deal last year by bringing more of our expert Blue Shirts onto our digital and phone platforms to support our customers. In fact, most aspects of our unique and full suite of services have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For example, install, delivery and in-store and in-home repair volume is all up over last year and higher than 2 years ago. Active My Best Buy loyalty program members have grown considerably, and members are using the program more than last year and 2 years ago. Our Total Tech Support Membership acquisition metrics, such as sales per store per day, have rebounded and are even higher than what they were 2 years ago. In addition, total usage of the program is up more than last year and 2 years ago. During Q1, we saw strong growth from engaged and re-engaged customers. Starting at the beginning of the pandemic through March, we saw elevated growth in new customers. In total, new customer growth was about 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. These new customers gained during the pandemic have slightly different demographics from our historical new customers, such as slightly younger, slightly more female and slightly lower income. We are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining these new customers at rates similar to historical levels, considering they are not only a slightly different demographic, but they also represent a much larger group of new customers than we have historically seen. As I mentioned earlier, online sales were 33% of domestic sales this quarter compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. For the year, we have updated our working assumption regarding the mix of online sales, and now expect it to be in the mid 30% range from our original expectation of approximately 40%. This compares to 19% for the full year 2 years ago in fiscal '20. Nevertheless, clearly, the pandemic has accelerated the evolution of customer shopping behavior. Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve four distinct shopping needs, inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We have a unique ability to serve all of these needs, at all times, in all channels. We are currently looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet these customer expectations and needs. As we discussed in our past few earnings calls, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives to better understand how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible and engaged workforce. Late last year, we launched a pilot in Houston to test a much more experiential store. For example, from an inspire and support standpoint, it has new PC gaming, headphone and fitness experiences, as well as fully re-modeled premium home theater and appliance experiences. In addition, it has a much bigger Geek Squad presence in the store. From a fulfillment standpoint, we reoriented the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. Early results from this pilot show higher NPS and sales relative to its group of control stores. Late last year, we also began piloting new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs in four Minneapolis locations. In these locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to provide incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship from store transactions. The product assortment on the sales floor still includes the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandise SKU count is reduced to focus on the most popular items. Accordingly, the pilot stores have fewer store associates, and we are testing a queue functionality for customers who would like to consult with an associate. In one of the four locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Our goal is to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction, while reducing selling square footage, improving speed and convenience and operating a more efficient model. We will continue to refine and iterate to learn and evolve our hypothesis. Later this year, we will be piloting a new market approach. To best address local customer needs, we will leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. From a physical store standpoint in this market we will be testing an array of different prototypes, including 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores, a new outlet store and even smaller 5,000 square foot stores. Our goal is to improve customer penetration by delivering new, more efficient and still experiential store formats that are more proximate and relevant to customers. In addition, we believe we can operate more efficiently. For example, by reducing total retail square footage across the market, reducing open box costs, and improving utilization of our repair and auto tech capability. We also continue to refine our ship from store hub concept. While all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship from store units in a limited number of stores across the country. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model is evolving to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting, shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has amplified the need to look at how we get our work done. As we think about our labor operating model, we are designing for employee choice, flexibility and career opportunity. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. A core aspect of our strategy going forward is up-skilling and re-skilling field employees. The benefits of this go beyond just a more flexible workforce. Yes, it allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. But just as importantly, our employees are gaining skills that can be used across their career journey, and they are gaining more confidence. Early results are showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. And we are making significant progress, as to date thousands of employees have earned multiple skill sets. As we continue to evolve our labor model, we have not lost sight of the competitive advantage our team members provide, especially in more complex sales transactions. Specifically, our in-home advisers, the Pacific Kitchen & Home Experts and Magnolia system designers have the unique ability to create and build relationships and have developed clienteling skills. Earlier this month, we brought these three previously siloed teams together into one team. This will allow us to serve customers more seamlessly across all the ways they want to interact with us, whether it is virtually, in our stores or in their homes. This change positions our most skilled employees against the most complex work within an entire market and will provide improved career progression opportunities for our sales team. Now called consultants and designers, the members of this coordinated team currently number nearly 3,000. We shared last quarter, that our overall headcount was down approximately 17% as we entered the fiscal year. The percent of our total employees that are now full time is approximately 60% compared to 54% pre-pandemic. We are iterating to find the balance between providing employees full time opportunities that come with benefits and guaranteed hours and schedules, while also maintaining the flexibility that is often important in retail. Overall, we are doubling down on the expertise by investing in our people, in their training, skill sets and career progression. We also continue to expand our employee benefits, most recently adding new programs focused on diabetes, physical therapy, and supporting and advocating for employees in the LGBTQIA+ community, and those managing complex chronic or ongoing care needs. These are in addition to benefits we added over the past few years, that include 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. In addition, to show our appreciation for their hard work over the last several months and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses this year. In March, all hourly US employees received $500 at full time and $200 at part time or occasional seasonal. Furthermore, all hourly field employees will receive an incremental $150 recognition award over the next two weeks. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly. And we remain keenly focused on keeping employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time-off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant their needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. I would like to now share the latest developments of our membership strategy. As we mentioned on our last call, we purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic. Last month, we began piloting a new membership program called Best Buy Beta in 60 stores. This offer combines compelling benefits from our total tech support program, our My Best Buy loyalty program and our credit card program, in addition to other benefits. To be clear, what we are piloting is not in direct competition with Amazon Prime, Walmart Plus, or frankly, any other membership programs in the market today. It is playing to our unique strengths and what customers want from Best Buy. It includes exclusive member pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, up to 2 years of warranty protection on product purchases, a 60 day extended return window, free standard shipping and delivery, and free installation on most products and appliances. I would note that all Best Buy customers already receive free and fast shipping on orders over $35, while Best Buy Beta customers get free and fast shipping on everything, including same-day deliveries. Membership also includes access to a support concierge service that is available only to Best Buy Beta members. The Best Buy Concierge team is available 24/7 by phone, chat, e-mail or through the Best Buy app. The cost is the same as our current total tech support program, $199.99 per year or $179.99 [ph] per year for the Best Buy credit card holders. The goal of Best Buy Beta is to create a membership experience that customers will love and value, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE wallet dollars to Best Buy. It is very early, and the test results and insights will inform what we ultimately end up rolling out on a national level. But so far, we like what we are seeing from a customer and employee proposition perspective. Changing topic for a moment, I want to reflect on the fact that this week marks the one year anniversary of George Floyd's murder. For us, his death last year was a long overdue catalyst for change. And as you may recall, I shared at that time that we would do better, and I'm proud to report that we have on many fronts. One area of particular emphasis for us is our role in underserved communities. In fact, just last week, we announced we're investing $10 million over 5 years to create pathways to opportunity for teams from disinvested communities in Los Angeles. As part of that effort, we will build a network of 10 to 12 team tech centers, providing access to cutting edge technology, scale building and career mentorship, with a specific focus on connections and training in creative and entertainment careers. We will also provide localized post-secondary guidance, scholarships and mental health and wellness support. This Los Angeles community Impact Hub is a key step toward our goal to build a network of 100 team tech centers by 2025, which is part of our broader commitment to address technology, inequities and advance economic and social justice. One particularly exciting aspect of this initiative is that we are using a new approach that engages deep partnerships with like minded public and private organizations in the local community. In this case, founding partners Annenberg Foundation and Greater LA Education Foundation, and a variety of vendor partners and other organizations. We believe this will be an effective model for amplifying our social impact efforts, and we expect to deploy something similar in other markets. In summary, the year has clearly started out much stronger than we originally expected. That momentum is continuing into Q2, and we are raising our outlook. As we think more short term, specifically the back half of this year, we expect shopping behavior will continue to evolve, as customers are able to spend more time on activities like eating out, traveling and other events. And there remains uncertainty as to how this may impact our business, especially as we lap particularly strong sales in the back half of last year. That being said, there are a number of factors that reinforce our confidence over the longer term. First, it has become evident throughout the pandemic that technology is even more important to people's lives. And we are excited about what that means for our business going forward, especially in combination with both the heightened technology innovation that supports our more home based way of work and life and our unique ability to inspire and support our customers. These are permanent structural shifts that we are seeing towards more hybrid work and learning models, streaming entertainment and a sustained focus on the home. This increased penetration of consumer electronics presents opportunity, as we grow our consultative in-home model to help our customers optimize the potential of their technology, as well as our unique support model that keeps it all working the way they want.  Second, we believe the consumer is in a materially improved position, with higher savings, stronger credit, more prolific vaccination and more available jobs. Third, even with the elevated demand we have seen throughout the pandemic, we believe the nesting phenomenon will continue to drive demand for products and services that help customers improve their home experience. And our vendor partners are already innovating to create new solutions that cater to this nesting phenomenon, like cameras and televisions and portable computing geared toward video interactions.  And fourth, we believe there remains opportunity in the install base that has not yet replaced or upgraded their technology products. For example, NPD estimates 15% of the TV installed base upgraded more quickly than expected. There is also opportunity in low penetration categories, like health, fitness and small appliances that have room for growth. Furthermore, inventory constraints in areas like gaming support sustained demand as customers continue to seek out ways to entertain at home.  But before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to say a few words about Mike Mohan, who is participating today in his last earnings call as Best Buy's President and COO. When Mike shared that it might be time for him to leave Best Buy, I was met with many emotions. We've worked together for so many years and built a true friendship I have grown to cherish. As his friend, I was proud that he was ready to leave the company he loves and set out to pursue his desire to do more. As a colleague, I was truly saddened that the idea that I wouldn't be able to count on his advice and insights as I have for so long. What Mike leaves behind is a legacy of countless people whose careers he supported and thousands of decisions, large and small, that always prioritized Best Buy's success in good times and bad.  When things were at their worst, he helped study the company with his trademark candor and almost intuitive understanding of what makes this company tick. We saw him at its best this past year, bringing a lifetime of experience to drive clarity in a truly unique time. Most significantly, he has created a team that is, I believe, the best in the country, a team that will now step up and build on the strengths and growth opportunities that Mike himself has been so instrumental in creating. Because we will not be replacing either the President or Chief Operating Officer role, three of Mike's six direct reports will now report to me. They include Rob Bass, who continues to run our Supply Chain and Global Properties organization, Damien Harmon, as our Head of Omnichannel Operations, and Jason Bonfigt, who is our Chief Merchant. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for next quarter and the full year.\nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Let me start by thanking our employees for the extraordinary results they delivered in the first quarter. Our team's ability to not only keep pace with the strong customer demand, but also provide an unmatched customer experience, while making strategic progress is truly remarkable. As a result, our performance was well-ahead of our working assumptions we laid out at the start of the quarter. Enterprise comparable sales growth of 37% far surpassed our estimate of approximately 20%. We were able to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology that has remained throughout the pandemic. The sales originating from inside our stores was also higher than we anticipated and was a contributor to our higher sales volume versus expectations. In addition, our original outlook did not include the benefit of the March stimulus payments. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved approximately 30 basis points versus last year, which exceeded our expectations of a slight rate decline. The primary driver was a more favorable promotional environment, as the demand for technology remains strong throughout the entire quarter. In addition, the impact of supply chain costs was slightly favorable to our gross profit rate due to the higher mix of sales originating from our stores. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew approximately 15% compared to last year, which was higher than our outlook of approximately 10% growth, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and increased variable costs from higher sales. Let me now share more details, specific to our first quarter versus last year. On enterprise revenue of $11.6 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23, an increase of 233% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.4% increased to 350 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 310 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A and the 30 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.14 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. Store closures in the various operating model changes we experienced last year during the early phases of the pandemic played a factor in our growth this quarter. And will continue to impact our year-over-year financial performance throughout the year. As a reminder, we closed our stores to in-person shopping on March 22, shifting to curbside fulfillment to keep our employees and customers safe. By June 22, most of our stores were open to in-store shopping, with capacity limits and reduced store hours. While these operating model changes certainly impacted our financial results in Q1, they by no means, should take away from the team's ability to successfully execute and serve our customers. As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the first quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 27%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite more than 40 fewer stores and online revenue growth of 175% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue, our non-GAAP operating income rate was 260 basis points higher this quarter, than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. Now, moving back to our performance versus last year. In our domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 37% to $10.8 billion. Comparable sales growth of 38% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in a curbside only operating model during the period. International revenue of $796 million increased to 23%, and included comparable sales growth of 28% and the benefit of approximately 1000 basis points of a favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These items were partially offset by exiting our operations in Mexico, which resulted in approximately $69 million less revenue this quarter compared to last year. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.3%, which was driven by improved product margin rates, which included reduced promotions and rate improvement from our supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by increased large product installation and delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during the last years first quarter. Compared to 2 years ago, our gross profit rate this quarter was approximately 40 basis points lower, primarily due to supply chain costs from the higher mix of online revenue. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23%, primarily due to improved product margin rates. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 16% compared to last year and decreased 290 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest driver of the expense increased versus last year were, one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $190 million, including approximately $40 million [ph] for the gratitude and appreciation awards, Corie mentioned earlier. Two, technology investments, which also includes support of our health initiatives. And three, increased variable costs associated with a higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees. When comparing two years ago, domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $156 million and decreased 280 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were consistent with the drivers versus last year, higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to higher sales volume, partially offsetting the previous items was lower store payroll expense. Let me share some additional context on higher incentive compensation expense. First, it was much higher than expected in the first quarter due to the strong performance. It also includes the gratitude bonuses that Corie discussed. Second, since we now expect the full year to exceed our original annual incentive performance targets, we expect incentive compensation for the full year to be a larger expense than our original working assumptions. As a reminder, from a comparison standpoint, we did not record short term incentive expense for the first half of last year due to the temporary suspension of our plans. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short term investments. At the end of Q1, our inventory balance was 43% higher than last year's comparable period and was 10% higher than our Q1 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as actions we took last year to lower inventory receipts based on our reduced sales outlook at the time. The health of our inventory remains very strong and the increased in accounts payable this quarter was 44%, which demonstrates the rapid pace we continue to turn our inventory. Although, trends have improved from the early phases of the pandemic, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. During the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $927 million in dividends of $175 million. As we look to the full year, we now expect to spend approximately $2.5 billion in share repurchases during fiscal '22, which compares to our previous outlook of at least $2 billion. Let me next share more color on the full year outlook for fiscal '22. We are encouraged by our results in the first quarter, and our outlook for the second quarter. We now estimate fiscal '22 comparable sales growth in the range of 3% to 6%, which compares to our previous working assumption of down 2% to up 1%. While we continue to believe the role of technology in people's lives has only has only intensified as a result of pandemic, our working assumptions still reflect a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that have slowed from the start of the pandemic and the back half of this year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately flat to fiscal '21. From an SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase as a percentage of revenue in the range - as a percentage in the range of 6% to 7% consistent with what I shared last quarter. There are a number of factors driving the expense increase. First, we expect our SG&A expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis, as we lap COVID-related we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to a more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items, such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping of $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation that we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. Second, we plan to increase our investments in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. This increase also includes depreciation expense. Third, we now expect our incentive compensation, including gratitude and appreciation awards from Q1 to increase in the range of to $225 million to $275 million. There are clearly other puts and takes that will - we will manage through. Some of that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. In relation to capital expenditure, we still expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22. Now, I will provide some color on our second quarter. We expect comparable sales to be up approximately 17%, the trends we have seen to start this quarter have remained strong, and our revenue growth for the first three weeks of the quarter has been approximately 30%. We anticipate that our gross profit rate will be approximately flat to last year. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase approximately 20% compared to last year. As a reminder, we made several cost decisions at the start of our second quarter last year to align with lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and expecting to continue at that point. The primary drivers that expected year-over-year increase, include, first, we expect our incentive compensation to increase by approximately $100 million, second, we expect our store payroll cost to increase as we lap last years store closures, third, we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to lower costs and reserve liquidity such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items. In addition, we plan to increase our investments in supportive technology in our health business. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I'd love to focus on the two year trends, and particularly, where you think you are gaining share, or maybe you haven't been gaining share, if you look at it now in hindsight. Like, you mentioned, certain categories where things are strong, but just anything else on those new customers you won and how much up that is versus '19? Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Sure. Greg, I'll start on the share question. Obviously, it's a little bit of a tricky compared to last year because we had our stores closed as Matt said for part of the quarter. So when you look back 2 years, we feel like across the board, we've at least recovered our share positions. If not, you know, there's obviously some puts and takes in categories, but especially as we got the stores back open, we were able to provide those installation and delivery experiences, then you know we were able to recover, especially in some of those large cube areas like appliances and televisions. As it relates to some of the new customers that we're seeing, like we said on the call, we're seeing - we saw about 50% growth in our new customer acquisition. So we're always acquiring new customers, that's the good news. But during the pandemic, we've seen about 50% growth. And like we said it's been skewing towards a slightly different and different customer mix then what we\u2019ve seen, slightly more female, a little bit more low income demographic, and importantly also a younger demographic. For the first time the largest cohort that we have of customers over the last 12 months is actually millennials, which is good when we're also seeing retention levels similar to what we've seen historically with these new customers. Does that help?\nGreg Melich: That helps a lot. I\u2019ll let somebody else go. Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Great quarter. So my question, you talked a bit about this in the prepared comments with recent trends, but clearly, some significant upside to your sales expectations here in Q1. How much do you think was stimulus driven, and if you look at the ongoing strength in the business here into the second fiscal quarter, is stimulus still playing a factor there?\nMatthew Bilunas: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Clearly, we do believe stimulus did play a factor at our performance, as we think about going from Q1 to Q2. March and April, a little stronger than February and as we entered into May, we're starting the quarter off at about 30%. And clearly stimulus, like the other stimulus\u2019s that we saw is playing an impact. It's very difficult to monitor or actually estimate what that is. And it's part of the reason as we look to the future, you know, the back half of this year, we know that it has had some impact and why we would see the back half being a little bit different than the front half of this year. But it clearly is having an impact and we'll have to watch and see where that goes. There is an element of childcare tax credits that are coming that could also help and replace some of the stimulus, so we'll watch that as close as we can.\nBrian Nagel: Great. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Bellinger with Wolfe Research.\nDavid Bellinger: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. And best of luck to Mike as well here. So in regards to monetizing the Best Buy website and digital properties, I think in the past you previously mentioned around 2 billion visits per year to your site and that number is likely much higher now with the shift to e-commerce. So are you taking any extra measures and monetizing those page views as their, you know, even greater potential for a stream of higher margin revenue to build much more quickly this year and in the years ahead, just given the shift we've had in the overall space?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. Thank you for the question, David. Well, we haven't really disclosed specific details on it. You can imagine that finding a way to monetize that level of traffic is an important part of the retail model, and that's definitely true for us as it is for any other retailer. Our traffic and our engaged customers are an incredible asset. We think they are very valuable to our brand partners, both currently, but also increasingly, as the media landscape evolves. So, you can imagine that we are leveraging those assets currently. And we're continuing to develop new and differentiated ways in which we can make sure that we optimize that traffic.\nDavid Bellinger: Great. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. I wanted to focus on the fulfillment strategies. Maybe a specific focus on, I believe, Corie, you mentioned delivered by employee as a growing sort of method for your customer base. So can you expand on how that works? Like, what these employees are trained to do as they arrive at the customer's home? And how the offering is or how you expect it to impact the evolution of the customer relationship?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. So first, I'm just going to take one gigantic step back and just say I'm incredibly proud of our supply chain performance and myriad teams that have helped us deliver throughout what is unprecedented demand. And I think it's interesting because there's such a portfolio approach to how we think about supply chain at Best Buy. I mean, it's evolved from the conventional distribution center model. And think about all the touch points we have with customers for fulfillment, vending machines, lockers, alternate pickup locations, curbside, in-store, same-day, next-day, employees, ship from store. I actually think it\u2019s really important to set that context, first, because it allows us a great deal of flexibility to deliver with speed and with convenience to the customer. Specific to what we're seeing with our employee delivery, we saw a bout two times the penetration that we had in Q1 - in Q4, excuse me, into Q1. And what those employees are trained to, they're mostly actually supporting our next day capabilities, and it's actually kind of a surprise and delight moment. They're able to leverage some of the extra capacity, they're driving around the neighborhoods near the store. They're able to walk up deliver that package. And typically, the customer feedback we hear is, I wasn't expecting a Blue Shirt necessarily to come walking up with a package and deliver it safely to my home. So I think it's a way for us to leverage the brand and the unique aspects of our Blue Shirts, but also do with some level of convenience. Mike, do you have something to add?\nMichael Mohan: Yeah. Steve, I think its great question and I'm excited for what the team has put together. As you look forward, as scheduling, flexibility and some of the systems will enable us to even be more on demand, we really want to have a great experience, so that's why like Corie mentioned most of this is next day, so we can queue it up and have this amazing experience. I think what makes us interesting is that we got the permission from customers to get across the threshold and we're thinking about that quite a bit. So today, it's a ring a doorbell and drop it on the step, but I think you can maybe pull on the string a little bit and we have the ability to get into someone's home, have a conversation, set up a profile, maybe even have a discussion around membership, and potentially get them set up as an advisor. So I think you know, that's one of the things we're excited about the most. But also we\u2019re going to give our employees some choice in the moment if they want to pick up extra income, they can also be doing this and supporting the experience with our customers.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. Best of luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Corie, it was great to hear about the new pilot. I wondered what the ultimate goal was with these pilots with regard to real estate. Is it about overall less square footage, or is it about shifting square footage from selling to distribution?\nCorie Barry: I think it's a little bit potentially about both, but I'd argue right now, a little bit more of the latter, where we're trying to figure out what's the right mix of having those distribution facilities that deliver with convenience. But also enough touch points, importantly, so that you also are able to meet the customer expectations. I mean, when still 60% of what we sell is either being picked up in a store or shipped from a store that in-store capability is incredibly important to the customer experience. And so, I will start with where I did in the prepared remarks and that is our number one goal is to ensure seamless customer experiences. And as we said, our customers look to us for everything from inspiration and support, all the way to that really convenient fulfillment opportunity. And so the goal of the test right now is to say, what is the right balance between that really deep experiential selling square footage, that fulfillment square footage that might be behind the scenes. And one of the things that you didn't quite get in the prepared remarks is that often, you might have a little bit less selling square footage, but all the SKUs are available in the back because it's like a mini fulfillment center, so you can still deliver on the customer experiences. And so it's - right now, it's about trying to test how do all these things play together and then what's the right balance that delivers importantly on the customer expectations over time.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. I had a follow up on the store pilots, curious how we should think about the portability of some of these that you're running? Clearly, you're very early on here; they're nascent at this stage. But what are the milestones you need to see? And when do you anticipate being at a point when you maybe to think about a broader rollout? Thanks so much.\nCorie Barry: You bet. I'd start by just reinforcing kind of where I ended the last question and that is we're testing for the right mix of experience, space, and location. And all those things need to play together in the right way. We obviously feel urgency. We want to make sure that we figure this out. But we don't want to be so urgent that we risk the customer and thankfully also the employee experience in this work. And it's important to note, we're not even in a normalized environment yet, right? We still have the impacts of COVID. You have stimulus like there's a lot of things still impacting shopping behavior, which means you don't want to take a false read, and then roll some of these out. And then even the full market tests that I was talking about on the call, that's set to launch in the back half of this year. So we haven't even started the launch on that one. So we don't have anything to announce today. We wanted to start to give you more clarity on the true impacts we're trying to test the true market level test that we\u2019re doing. And we want to make sure wasn't just seen as done [ph] the fulfillment inside that is also the new experiential aspects that we're adding. And I think we would say we have a pretty good history of rolling out concepts as soon as we feel like we have the right case sitting behind them. And so, as we know more about and feel like we have a sustained understanding of what each of these concepts does for the customer and the employee, then we'll come back to you with the more distinct rollout plans. Mike?\nMichael Mohan: Maybe you know, adding on to what Corie said, Jonathan, maybe two other things is, I just want to reinforce. We have an incredibly good network of real estate locations today and I think that's really important, because it complements the strategy of why we need our stores. And the second is almost half of our stores are up for renewal. We do a relatively short term leases with our team. And so we have the ability to be super flexible to move with speed, depending on what we see, will be like, at any given time in the market as well.\nJonathan Matuszewski: It's really helpful. Thanks for the color.\nCorie Barry: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, everyone. Good morning. I'm going to ask one question with two parts, related to store sales sort of coming back here. Can you just tell us if store sales are coming back, what you're seeing in terms of service attach rate, warranty attach rate? And then the mid-30s e-commerce mix, now that it's a little bit lower from your initial expectation. What, if anything, is that doing to your EBIT margin forecast for the year? Did that help in any way?\nMatthew Bilunas: Yeah. Thank you for the question, Simeon. Overarchingly, as we see the store's sales rebound a bit from last year, we are seeing strong attach rates, pretty normal historical level attach rates with our stores and as we've talked about in the past as e-commerce is a growing business. We're seeing continued improvement on e-commerce attach as well. So we're seeing good utilization. We're selling a lot of television appliances and so the installation delivery is quite high, that we've been talking about. So, things are returning to back to normal if you will, and obviously, there's a lot of need to support people in their homes, as they're living in a very hybrid way right now. So, we're seeing a good return to our services business. From an e-com mix and what that does to the EBIT range, clearly, if you look at the implied math this year from our new guide, it does imply that, even though our e-com mix is a bit lower than we estimated in starting the year that the implied math is that our OI rates are actually a little stronger than they would have been at the start of the year. So, even though we're mixing a little bit out of e-com, we are still seeing good leverage on our sales, despite the fact we are shifting back a bit more into store sales.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Ciccarelli: Hi, guys. It's Scott Ciccarelli. You mentioned supply chain efficiencies. But we do continue to hear about product shortages. We have whole categories like automobiles and appliances facing pretty significant shortages. But your inventories, at least from the outside, look like they are in pretty good shape. So can you provide any more color regarding your inventory flow? Are you facing any supply shortages at this point? And how do you think that will evolve in the back half? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yeah, Scott. Thanks for the question. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have definitely said that we've seen at least some spotty inventory shortages. And so obviously, to your point, the team has done an amazing job navigating an environment where they can drive a 37% comp. And our days of supply have been improving throughout the quarter, and we think they'll continue to improve into Q2. But given the unprecedented demand and some of the production disruptions, we have seen constraints, particularly in appliances, computing, TVs. And then we've talked about gaming, obviously, which has been a bit spotty. We're seeing some of that disruption driven by really four things. You've got raw materials and production capacity. You've got the very well-documented chip shortages. You've got port and container constraints and delays. And then ultimately, over all of that is this kind of sustained unprecedented, truly global demand in our space. And I think what's interesting about our business is we have a high degree of transferability. Meaning because we are a special PCE player, especially if you come into the store, but I would argue in our digital properties, we can help you navigate what exactly you are looking for, and then what are the variety of products that might meet your needs. So if you come in for a certain SKU, Scott, as an example, we'll have an associate there who might say, we don't have that one, but here is another SKU that will meet your same needs, same size TV, same spec, that kind of thing. And so I think that helps us navigate this inventory situation in a way that's a little bit different than others. And like I said, I think we're going to continue we believe, to see some level of inventory constraints likely in pockets throughout the rest of the year, assuming that you kind of continue to see the sustained level of demand. But I'm very proud and impress the way the team is navigating through it. And then the last thing I would say before we got is, our inventory is also in the best situation, I see that in terms of at [ph] risk. It's very clean inventory. Much of it is new. It's turning really fast, like Matt said. So it's actually some of the highest inventory quality we've ever seen.\nScott Ciccarelli: Super helpful. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson.\nMichael Baker: Hey, guys. I wanted to ask about the SG&A increase. So you said 225 to 275 in incentive comp increase year-over-year, I think it was an incentive comp. What was the increase in the previous guidance? Because it seems like most of the increase in the SG&A comes from the higher incentive comp. So I guess if you could help us with some numbers there, and then confirm if that's the biggest reason for the increase and what else might be in the increase in SG&A dollars versus the previous guidance? Thank you.\nMatthew Bilunas: Yeah. Thank you for the question. In the previous guidance, essentially, short term incentive was assumed to be flat for the year, as we looked through the first quarter and our performance. And again, look outwards towards the end of the year, that performance clearly increased. And so that 225 to 275 is really the increased expectations on the full year business, and our original asset was basically flat on a year-over-year basis. So the other elements of SG&A from a guide perspective, it's pretty consistent. We know that we're going to continue developing technology or continue to invest in technology and health, and that's about $150 million. That's still in our guide for the year. And then, as well, we do know that there's about $100 million of COVID-related decisions we made last year that we have to lap this year. And that's inclusive of the $40 million contribution to the foundation, we made in Q3. So those are consistent. The biggest increase is really around that incentive compensation adjustment.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I appreciate the color.\nMatthew Bilunas: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. Good morning. It's Seth Basham. My question is around the computing category. You continue to see strength there, little bit some product shortages. But as you think about the prospects for that category going forward, against really strong sales last year, probably doing work from home and school from home phenomenon, do you expect to see a meaningful drag on your sales results from that category?\nMichael Mohan: Hey, Seth. Its Mike. I'll start, and Corie and Matt can chime in. Computing has been a phenomenal sales success story in the industry and for Best Buy. And I think the position that we created look for consumers and then, you know, for some of our direct-to-business segments as well driving our good results. I think the category is also going to be constraint and we have talk a little bit about our inventory. And we feel we have enough inventories to meet the demands, and inventory is getting better. We're going to have a - maybe more normal back-to-school selling season as kind of things normalize. In an environment where the inventory remains relatively tight, and some of the form factors are changing quickly. We moved from things needed to be ultra portable and very productivity driven to things that need bigger screens, for example. And that means new product revs, when we see new product revs, we usually see less proportionality. So overall, I think you guys know that computing does have a lower profit rate than some of the other businesses at Best Buy, but the actual revenue contribution and then actual EBIT flow through is really attractively we like it. And I don't know if Corie or Matt, you might have anything else to add here.\nCorie Barry: No. I would just underscore. I think we are seeing a huge refresh right now as Mike said, and it's still not done. And demand for PC gaming and crypto and graphics cards remains really high as well. So it's a broad category, when we talk about it. And so I think you are still going to see a population that likely is going to be living some hybrid [ph] life for the foreseeable future and I think the refresh cycle as a result are going to continue to speed up as people look forward that new and better way for them to work-from-home, school-from-home and continue actually the stream-from-home in some cases. So yeah, obviously it's been six quarters of positive comp growth, but we continue to see a real demand for the continued innovation of the products.\nSeth Basham: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America.\nCurtis Nagle: Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. So maybe I was hoping we can maybe contextualize the comp guidance a little bit. So you guys just put up in certainly good 1Q number, 2Q looks great, took up your guidance by a lot obviously. But in terms of kind of what's implied for the rest of the year, I don't think that there's been much of a change and. Or put another way, it implies a pretty significant deceleration. I guess, the holidays didn\u2019t come and we don't know where spending is going to go. But at least today if we sort of look at the data, in markets that have opened up and travel is coming back. That doesn't look to me like, you're seeing a pullback in home or see or anything else. So I guess, just any more \u2013 anything more you could say in terms of framing that and how conservative or not maybe do you think your guidance for the year is?\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. Thank you. And I can start and then Corie could jump in if she wants there. I think fundamentally, we believe, just starting with the rural technology and people's lives has only intensified. And so essentially, what we've done is we took our Q1 beat and then increased our cost [ph] expectations for Q2. And we really left the back half unchanged at this point because there's still a lot of uncertainty. We are seeing customers shop in the service category areas now in addition to ours. We're still seeing some strength even though people are returning to more normalized shopping behavior. But we also are thoughtful about the fact that stimulus will probably have a less event impact as we get into the back half of the year. And so those are some of the bigger things in our mind. I think we do believe that the hybrid work model will continue. So there could be some continued opportunity there as well. As you look at the back half, the personal saving rate is very high and people's financial credit stability is very strong. And again, there could be some additional child tax credits coming in earlier - this back half of the year. And then in addition, we have - we continue to be optimistic about innovation and how continued relationships with partners like T-Mobile will help our business. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the back half will hold in terms of the customer shopping trends. And also, we just still are wary of inventory availability. We have a lot of inventory. We can still support a high level of sales with constraints, but there is a very high demand that we have to be thoughtful about as well. So that's essentially the thoughts that went into the EBIT guide.\nCurtis Nagle: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba: Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Pretty simple question, if I look at your 2 year stack comp, it's up almost 32%. Just wondering when the last time that Best Buy did a 32% 2 year stack comp? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: I think before our recorded history. Thanks for the question, Anthony.\nAnthony Chukumba: No problem. Keep up the good work.\nCorie Barry: Thank you. And with that, I think that's our last question. Thank you so much for joining us today. And I hope that many of our investors listening today are able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 16. Thanks so much, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Let me start by thanking our employees for the extraordinary results they delivered in the first quarter. Our team's ability to not only keep pace with the strong customer demand, but also provide an unmatched customer experience, while making strategic progress is truly remarkable. As a result, our performance was well-ahead of our working assumptions we laid out at the start of the quarter. Enterprise comparable sales growth of 37% far surpassed our estimate of approximately 20%. We were able to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology that has remained throughout the pandemic. The sales originating from inside our stores was also higher than we anticipated and was a contributor to our higher sales volume versus expectations. In addition, our original outlook did not include the benefit of the March stimulus payments. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved approximately 30 basis points versus last year, which exceeded our expectations of a slight rate decline. The primary driver was a more favorable promotional environment, as the demand for technology remains strong throughout the entire quarter. In addition, the impact of supply chain costs was slightly favorable to our gross profit rate due to the higher mix of sales originating from our stores. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew approximately 15% compared to last year, which was higher than our outlook of approximately 10% growth, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and increased variable costs from higher sales. Let me now share more details, specific to our first quarter versus last year. On enterprise revenue of $11.6 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23, an increase of 233% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.4% increased to 350 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 310 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A and the 30 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.14 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. Store closures in the various operating model changes we experienced last year during the early phases of the pandemic played a factor in our growth this quarter. And will continue to impact our year-over-year financial performance throughout the year. As a reminder, we closed our stores to in-person shopping on March 22, shifting to curbside fulfillment to keep our employees and customers safe. By June 22, most of our stores were open to in-store shopping, with capacity limits and reduced store hours. While these operating model changes certainly impacted our financial results in Q1, they by no means, should take away from the team's ability to successfully execute and serve our customers. As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the first quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 27%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite more than 40 fewer stores and online revenue growth of 175% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue, our non-GAAP operating income rate was 260 basis points higher this quarter, than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. Now, moving back to our performance versus last year. In our domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 37% to $10.8 billion. Comparable sales growth of 38% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in a curbside only operating model during the period. International revenue of $796 million increased to 23%, and included comparable sales growth of 28% and the benefit of approximately 1000 basis points of a favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These items were partially offset by exiting our operations in Mexico, which resulted in approximately $69 million less revenue this quarter compared to last year. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.3%, which was driven by improved product margin rates, which included reduced promotions and rate improvement from our supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by increased large product installation and delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during the last years first quarter. Compared to 2 years ago, our gross profit rate this quarter was approximately 40 basis points lower, primarily due to supply chain costs from the higher mix of online revenue. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23%, primarily due to improved product margin rates. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 16% compared to last year and decreased 290 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest driver of the expense increased versus last year were, one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $190 million, including approximately $40 million [ph] for the gratitude and appreciation awards, Corie mentioned earlier. Two, technology investments, which also includes support of our health initiatives. And three, increased variable costs associated with a higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees. When comparing two years ago, domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $156 million and decreased 280 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were consistent with the drivers versus last year, higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to higher sales volume, partially offsetting the previous items was lower store payroll expense. Let me share some additional context on higher incentive compensation expense. First, it was much higher than expected in the first quarter due to the strong performance. It also includes the gratitude bonuses that Corie discussed. Second, since we now expect the full year to exceed our original annual incentive performance targets, we expect incentive compensation for the full year to be a larger expense than our original working assumptions. As a reminder, from a comparison standpoint, we did not record short term incentive expense for the first half of last year due to the temporary suspension of our plans. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short term investments. At the end of Q1, our inventory balance was 43% higher than last year's comparable period and was 10% higher than our Q1 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as actions we took last year to lower inventory receipts based on our reduced sales outlook at the time. The health of our inventory remains very strong and the increased in accounts payable this quarter was 44%, which demonstrates the rapid pace we continue to turn our inventory. Although, trends have improved from the early phases of the pandemic, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. During the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $927 million in dividends of $175 million. As we look to the full year, we now expect to spend approximately $2.5 billion in share repurchases during fiscal '22, which compares to our previous outlook of at least $2 billion. Let me next share more color on the full year outlook for fiscal '22. We are encouraged by our results in the first quarter, and our outlook for the second quarter. We now estimate fiscal '22 comparable sales growth in the range of 3% to 6%, which compares to our previous working assumption of down 2% to up 1%. While we continue to believe the role of technology in people's lives has only has only intensified as a result of pandemic, our working assumptions still reflect a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that have slowed from the start of the pandemic and the back half of this year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately flat to fiscal '21. From an SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase as a percentage of revenue in the range - as a percentage in the range of 6% to 7% consistent with what I shared last quarter. There are a number of factors driving the expense increase. First, we expect our SG&A expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis, as we lap COVID-related we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to a more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items, such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping of $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation that we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. Second, we plan to increase our investments in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. This increase also includes depreciation expense. Third, we now expect our incentive compensation, including gratitude and appreciation awards from Q1 to increase in the range of to $225 million to $275 million. There are clearly other puts and takes that will - we will manage through. Some of that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. In relation to capital expenditure, we still expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22. Now, I will provide some color on our second quarter. We expect comparable sales to be up approximately 17%, the trends we have seen to start this quarter have remained strong, and our revenue growth for the first three weeks of the quarter has been approximately 30%. We anticipate that our gross profit rate will be approximately flat to last year. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase approximately 20% compared to last year. As a reminder, we made several cost decisions at the start of our second quarter last year to align with lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and expecting to continue at that point. The primary drivers that expected year-over-year increase, include, first, we expect our incentive compensation to increase by approximately $100 million, second, we expect our store payroll cost to increase as we lap last years store closures, third, we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to lower costs and reserve liquidity such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items. In addition, we plan to increase our investments in supportive technology in our health business. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Clearly, we do believe stimulus did play a factor at our performance, as we think about going from Q1 to Q2. March and April, a little stronger than February and as we entered into May, we're starting the quarter off at about 30%. And clearly stimulus, like the other stimulus's that we saw is playing an impact. It's very difficult to monitor or actually estimate what that is. And it's part of the reason as we look to the future, you know, the back half of this year, we know that it has had some impact and why we would see the back half being a little bit different than the front half of this year. But it clearly is having an impact and we'll have to watch and see where that goes. There is an element of childcare tax credits that are coming that could also help and replace some of the stimulus, so we'll watch that as close as we can. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Simeon. Overarchingly, as we see the store's sales rebound a bit from last year, we are seeing strong attach rates, pretty normal historical level attach rates with our stores and as we've talked about in the past as e-commerce is a growing business. We're seeing continued improvement on e-commerce attach as well. So we're seeing good utilization. We're selling a lot of television appliances and so the installation delivery is quite high, that we've been talking about. So, things are returning to back to normal if you will, and obviously, there's a lot of need to support people in their homes, as they're living in a very hybrid way right now. So, we're seeing a good return to our services business. From an e-com mix and what that does to the EBIT range, clearly, if you look at the implied math this year from our new guide, it does imply that, even though our e-com mix is a bit lower than we estimated in starting the year that the implied math is that our OI rates are actually a little stronger than they would have been at the start of the year. So, even though we're mixing a little bit out of e-com, we are still seeing good leverage on our sales, despite the fact we are shifting back a bit more into store sales. Yeah. Thank you for the question. In the previous guidance, essentially, short term incentive was assumed to be flat for the year, as we looked through the first quarter and our performance. And again, look outwards towards the end of the year, that performance clearly increased. And so that 225 to 275 is really the increased expectations on the full year business, and our original asset was basically flat on a year-over-year basis. So the other elements of SG&A from a guide perspective, it's pretty consistent. We know that we're going to continue developing technology or continue to invest in technology and health, and that's about $150 million. That's still in our guide for the year. And then, as well, we do know that there's about $100 million of COVID-related decisions we made last year that we have to lap this year. And that's inclusive of the $40 million contribution to the foundation, we made in Q3. So those are consistent. The biggest increase is really around that incentive compensation adjustment. Yeah. Sure. Thank you. And I can start and then Corie could jump in if she wants there. I think fundamentally, we believe, just starting with the rural technology and people's lives has only intensified. And so essentially, what we've done is we took our Q1 beat and then increased our cost [ph] expectations for Q2. And we really left the back half unchanged at this point because there's still a lot of uncertainty. We are seeing customers shop in the service category areas now in addition to ours. We're still seeing some strength even though people are returning to more normalized shopping behavior. But we also are thoughtful about the fact that stimulus will probably have a less event impact as we get into the back half of the year. And so those are some of the bigger things in our mind.

And then in addition, we have - we continue to be optimistic about innovation and how continued relationships with partners like T-Mobile will help our business. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the back half will hold in terms of the customer shopping trends. And also, we just still are wary of inventory availability. We have a lot of inventory. We can still support a high level of sales with constraints, but there is a very high demand that we have to be thoughtful about as well. So that's essentially the thoughts that went into the EBIT guide."

            "name": "Michael Mohan",
            "content": "Yeah. Steve, I think its great question and I'm excited for what the team has put together. As you look forward, as scheduling, flexibility and some of the systems will enable us to even be more on demand, we really want to have a great experience, so that's why like Corie mentioned most of this is next day, so we can queue it up and have this amazing experience. I think what makes us interesting is that we got the permission from customers to get across the threshold and we're thinking about that quite a bit. So today, it's a ring a doorbell and drop it on the step, but I think you can maybe pull on the string a little bit and we have the ability to get into someone's home, have a conversation, set up a profile, maybe even have a discussion around membership, and potentially get them set up as an advisor. So I think you know, that's one of the things we're excited about the most. But also we're going to give our employees some choice in the moment if they want to pick up extra income, they can also be doing this and supporting the experience with our customers. Maybe you know, adding on to what Corie said, Jonathan, maybe two other things is, I just want to reinforce. We have an incredibly good network of real estate locations today and I think that's really important, because it complements the strategy of why we need our stores. And the second is almost half of our stores are up for renewal. We do a relatively short term leases with our team. And so we have the ability to be super flexible to move with speed, depending on what we see, will be like, at any given time in the market as well. Hey, Seth. Its Mike. I'll start, and Corie and Matt can chime in. Computing has been a phenomenal sales success story in the industry and for Best Buy. And I think the position that we created look for consumers and then, you know, for some of our direct-to-business segments as well driving our good results. I think the category is also going to be constraint and we have talk a little bit about our inventory. And we feel we have enough inventories to meet the demands, and inventory is getting better.

In an environment where the inventory remains relatively tight, and some of the form factors are changing quickly. We moved from things needed to be ultra portable and very productivity driven to things that need bigger screens, for example. And that means new product revs, when we see new product revs, we usually see less proportionality. So overall, I think you guys know that computing does have a lower profit rate than some of the other businesses at Best Buy, but the actual revenue contribution and then actual EBIT flow through is really attractively we like it. And I don't know if Corie or Matt, you might have anything else to add here."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year that included both periods of high demand and periods when our stores were closed to customer traffic. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20, revenue is up 27% and our earnings per share are up more than 100%. Customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter was extraordinarily high. This demand is being driven by continued focus on the home, which encompasses many aspects of our lives, including working, learning, cooking, entertaining, redecorating and remodeling. The demand was also bolstered by government stimulus programs and the strong housing environment. Our teams across the organization met that demand with remarkable execution. From our merchant and supply chain teams working behind the scenes to our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents on the front lines. Our employees once again showed amazing flexibility and execution managing extraordinary volumes. Most importantly, they provided exceptional customer service in a safe environment. From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales across virtually all product and service categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, computing and appliances. With the extraordinarily high customer demand, as well as production and distribution disruptions, product availability constraints continued to be a theme during Q1, as they have been throughout the pandemic, particularly in large appliances, computing, televisions and gaming. Our teams collaborated closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. This is a testament to the trust and unique relationships that our merchants have built with vendors over decades of partnership. Our results this quarter also highlight the strength of our supply chain. We were able to efficiently move the amount of inventory necessary to drive 37% comp sales growth, while navigating record demand across retail, container shortages and port congestion. We also improved our speed to customer, as our online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago pre-pandemic. In fact, same-day delivery to customer's homes was up 90% on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we continue to leverage our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q1, about 60% of our online revenue was either picked up in store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of our delivery experience. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 44%, similar to last year's first quarter. This strong performance would not have been possible without an amazing and resourceful team of people and the multi-year investments we have made in our supply chain transformation. Best Buy has a unique ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And as the impacts of the pandemic have evolved, customers across all age demographics are feeling more comfortable coming back into stores to see products firsthand, seek expert advice from our associates or get technical support from our Geek Squad agents. At the same time, sales originating online continued to be much higher than pre-pandemic and were 33% of our domestic sales compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. In addition, we continue to innovatively help customers via phone and chat. We learned a great deal last year by bringing more of our expert Blue Shirts onto our digital and phone platforms to support our customers. In fact, most aspects of our unique and full suite of services have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For example, install, delivery and in-store and in-home repair volume is all up over last year and higher than 2 years ago. Active My Best Buy loyalty program members have grown considerably, and members are using the program more than last year and 2 years ago. Our Total Tech Support Membership acquisition metrics, such as sales per store per day, have rebounded and are even higher than what they were 2 years ago. In addition, total usage of the program is up more than last year and 2 years ago. During Q1, we saw strong growth from engaged and re-engaged customers. Starting at the beginning of the pandemic through March, we saw elevated growth in new customers. In total, new customer growth was about 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. These new customers gained during the pandemic have slightly different demographics from our historical new customers, such as slightly younger, slightly more female and slightly lower income. We are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining these new customers at rates similar to historical levels, considering they are not only a slightly different demographic, but they also represent a much larger group of new customers than we have historically seen. As I mentioned earlier, online sales were 33% of domestic sales this quarter compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. For the year, we have updated our working assumption regarding the mix of online sales, and now expect it to be in the mid 30% range from our original expectation of approximately 40%. This compares to 19% for the full year 2 years ago in fiscal '20. Nevertheless, clearly, the pandemic has accelerated the evolution of customer shopping behavior. Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve four distinct shopping needs, inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We have a unique ability to serve all of these needs, at all times, in all channels. We are currently looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet these customer expectations and needs. As we discussed in our past few earnings calls, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives to better understand how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible and engaged workforce. Late last year, we launched a pilot in Houston to test a much more experiential store. For example, from an inspire and support standpoint, it has new PC gaming, headphone and fitness experiences, as well as fully re-modeled premium home theater and appliance experiences. In addition, it has a much bigger Geek Squad presence in the store. From a fulfillment standpoint, we reoriented the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. Early results from this pilot show higher NPS and sales relative to its group of control stores. Late last year, we also began piloting new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs in four Minneapolis locations. In these locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to provide incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship from store transactions. The product assortment on the sales floor still includes the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandise SKU count is reduced to focus on the most popular items. Accordingly, the pilot stores have fewer store associates, and we are testing a queue functionality for customers who would like to consult with an associate. In one of the four locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Our goal is to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction, while reducing selling square footage, improving speed and convenience and operating a more efficient model. We will continue to refine and iterate to learn and evolve our hypothesis. Later this year, we will be piloting a new market approach. To best address local customer needs, we will leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. From a physical store standpoint in this market we will be testing an array of different prototypes, including 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores, a new outlet store and even smaller 5,000 square foot stores. Our goal is to improve customer penetration by delivering new, more efficient and still experiential store formats that are more proximate and relevant to customers. In addition, we believe we can operate more efficiently. For example, by reducing total retail square footage across the market, reducing open box costs, and improving utilization of our repair and auto tech capability. We also continue to refine our ship from store hub concept. While all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship from store units in a limited number of stores across the country. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model is evolving to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting, shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has amplified the need to look at how we get our work done. As we think about our labor operating model, we are designing for employee choice, flexibility and career opportunity. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. A core aspect of our strategy going forward is up-skilling and re-skilling field employees. The benefits of this go beyond just a more flexible workforce. Yes, it allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. But just as importantly, our employees are gaining skills that can be used across their career journey, and they are gaining more confidence. Early results are showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. And we are making significant progress, as to date thousands of employees have earned multiple skill sets. As we continue to evolve our labor model, we have not lost sight of the competitive advantage our team members provide, especially in more complex sales transactions. Specifically, our in-home advisers, the Pacific Kitchen & Home Experts and Magnolia system designers have the unique ability to create and build relationships and have developed clienteling skills. Earlier this month, we brought these three previously siloed teams together into one team. This will allow us to serve customers more seamlessly across all the ways they want to interact with us, whether it is virtually, in our stores or in their homes. This change positions our most skilled employees against the most complex work within an entire market and will provide improved career progression opportunities for our sales team. Now called consultants and designers, the members of this coordinated team currently number nearly 3,000. We shared last quarter, that our overall headcount was down approximately 17% as we entered the fiscal year. The percent of our total employees that are now full time is approximately 60% compared to 54% pre-pandemic. We are iterating to find the balance between providing employees full time opportunities that come with benefits and guaranteed hours and schedules, while also maintaining the flexibility that is often important in retail. Overall, we are doubling down on the expertise by investing in our people, in their training, skill sets and career progression. We also continue to expand our employee benefits, most recently adding new programs focused on diabetes, physical therapy, and supporting and advocating for employees in the LGBTQIA+ community, and those managing complex chronic or ongoing care needs. These are in addition to benefits we added over the past few years, that include 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. In addition, to show our appreciation for their hard work over the last several months and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses this year. In March, all hourly US employees received $500 at full time and $200 at part time or occasional seasonal. Furthermore, all hourly field employees will receive an incremental $150 recognition award over the next two weeks. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly. And we remain keenly focused on keeping employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time-off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant their needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. I would like to now share the latest developments of our membership strategy. As we mentioned on our last call, we purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic. Last month, we began piloting a new membership program called Best Buy Beta in 60 stores. This offer combines compelling benefits from our total tech support program, our My Best Buy loyalty program and our credit card program, in addition to other benefits. To be clear, what we are piloting is not in direct competition with Amazon Prime, Walmart Plus, or frankly, any other membership programs in the market today. It is playing to our unique strengths and what customers want from Best Buy. It includes exclusive member pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, up to 2 years of warranty protection on product purchases, a 60 day extended return window, free standard shipping and delivery, and free installation on most products and appliances. I would note that all Best Buy customers already receive free and fast shipping on orders over $35, while Best Buy Beta customers get free and fast shipping on everything, including same-day deliveries. Membership also includes access to a support concierge service that is available only to Best Buy Beta members. The Best Buy Concierge team is available 24/7 by phone, chat, e-mail or through the Best Buy app. The cost is the same as our current total tech support program, $199.99 per year or $179.99 [ph] per year for the Best Buy credit card holders. The goal of Best Buy Beta is to create a membership experience that customers will love and value, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE wallet dollars to Best Buy. It is very early, and the test results and insights will inform what we ultimately end up rolling out on a national level. But so far, we like what we are seeing from a customer and employee proposition perspective. Changing topic for a moment, I want to reflect on the fact that this week marks the one year anniversary of George Floyd's murder. For us, his death last year was a long overdue catalyst for change. And as you may recall, I shared at that time that we would do better, and I'm proud to report that we have on many fronts. One area of particular emphasis for us is our role in underserved communities. In fact, just last week, we announced we're investing $10 million over 5 years to create pathways to opportunity for teams from disinvested communities in Los Angeles. As part of that effort, we will build a network of 10 to 12 team tech centers, providing access to cutting edge technology, scale building and career mentorship, with a specific focus on connections and training in creative and entertainment careers. We will also provide localized post-secondary guidance, scholarships and mental health and wellness support. This Los Angeles community Impact Hub is a key step toward our goal to build a network of 100 team tech centers by 2025, which is part of our broader commitment to address technology, inequities and advance economic and social justice. One particularly exciting aspect of this initiative is that we are using a new approach that engages deep partnerships with like minded public and private organizations in the local community. In this case, founding partners Annenberg Foundation and Greater LA Education Foundation, and a variety of vendor partners and other organizations. We believe this will be an effective model for amplifying our social impact efforts, and we expect to deploy something similar in other markets. In summary, the year has clearly started out much stronger than we originally expected. That momentum is continuing into Q2, and we are raising our outlook. As we think more short term, specifically the back half of this year, we expect shopping behavior will continue to evolve, as customers are able to spend more time on activities like eating out, traveling and other events. And there remains uncertainty as to how this may impact our business, especially as we lap particularly strong sales in the back half of last year. That being said, there are a number of factors that reinforce our confidence over the longer term. First, it has become evident throughout the pandemic that technology is even more important to people's lives. And we are excited about what that means for our business going forward, especially in combination with both the heightened technology innovation that supports our more home based way of work and life and our unique ability to inspire and support our customers. These are permanent structural shifts that we are seeing towards more hybrid work and learning models, streaming entertainment and a sustained focus on the home. This increased penetration of consumer electronics presents opportunity, as we grow our consultative in-home model to help our customers optimize the potential of their technology, as well as our unique support model that keeps it all working the way they want.  Second, we believe the consumer is in a materially improved position, with higher savings, stronger credit, more prolific vaccination and more available jobs. Third, even with the elevated demand we have seen throughout the pandemic, we believe the nesting phenomenon will continue to drive demand for products and services that help customers improve their home experience. And our vendor partners are already innovating to create new solutions that cater to this nesting phenomenon, like cameras and televisions and portable computing geared toward video interactions.  And fourth, we believe there remains opportunity in the install base that has not yet replaced or upgraded their technology products. For example, NPD estimates 15% of the TV installed base upgraded more quickly than expected. There is also opportunity in low penetration categories, like health, fitness and small appliances that have room for growth. Furthermore, inventory constraints in areas like gaming support sustained demand as customers continue to seek out ways to entertain at home.  But before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to say a few words about Mike Mohan, who is participating today in his last earnings call as Best Buy's President and COO. When Mike shared that it might be time for him to leave Best Buy, I was met with many emotions. We've worked together for so many years and built a true friendship I have grown to cherish. As his friend, I was proud that he was ready to leave the company he loves and set out to pursue his desire to do more. As a colleague, I was truly saddened that the idea that I wouldn't be able to count on his advice and insights as I have for so long. What Mike leaves behind is a legacy of countless people whose careers he supported and thousands of decisions, large and small, that always prioritized Best Buy's success in good times and bad.  When things were at their worst, he helped study the company with his trademark candor and almost intuitive understanding of what makes this company tick. We saw him at its best this past year, bringing a lifetime of experience to drive clarity in a truly unique time. Most significantly, he has created a team that is, I believe, the best in the country, a team that will now step up and build on the strengths and growth opportunities that Mike himself has been so instrumental in creating. Because we will not be replacing either the President or Chief Operating Officer role, three of Mike's six direct reports will now report to me. They include Rob Bass, who continues to run our Supply Chain and Global Properties organization, Damien Harmon, as our Head of Omnichannel Operations, and Jason Bonfigt, who is our Chief Merchant. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for next quarter and the full year. Sure. Greg, I'll start on the share question. Obviously, it's a little bit of a tricky compared to last year because we had our stores closed as Matt said for part of the quarter. So when you look back 2 years, we feel like across the board, we've at least recovered our share positions. If not, you know, there's obviously some puts and takes in categories, but especially as we got the stores back open, we were able to provide those installation and delivery experiences, then you know we were able to recover, especially in some of those large cube areas like appliances and televisions. As it relates to some of the new customers that we're seeing, like we said on the call, we're seeing - we saw about 50% growth in our new customer acquisition. So we're always acquiring new customers, that's the good news. But during the pandemic, we've seen about 50% growth. And like we said it's been skewing towards a slightly different and different customer mix then what we've seen, slightly more female, a little bit more low income demographic, and importantly also a younger demographic. For the first time the largest cohort that we have of customers over the last 12 months is actually millennials, which is good when we're also seeing retention levels similar to what we've seen historically with these new customers. Does that help? Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for the question, David. Well, we haven't really disclosed specific details on it. You can imagine that finding a way to monetize that level of traffic is an important part of the retail model, and that's definitely true for us as it is for any other retailer. Our traffic and our engaged customers are an incredible asset. We think they are very valuable to our brand partners, both currently, but also increasingly, as the media landscape evolves. So, you can imagine that we are leveraging those assets currently. And we're continuing to develop new and differentiated ways in which we can make sure that we optimize that traffic. Thank you. Yeah. So first, I'm just going to take one gigantic step back and just say I'm incredibly proud of our supply chain performance and myriad teams that have helped us deliver throughout what is unprecedented demand. And I think it's interesting because there's such a portfolio approach to how we think about supply chain at Best Buy. I mean, it's evolved from the conventional distribution center model. And think about all the touch points we have with customers for fulfillment, vending machines, lockers, alternate pickup locations, curbside, in-store, same-day, next-day, employees, ship from store. I actually think it's really important to set that context, first, because it allows us a great deal of flexibility to deliver with speed and with convenience to the customer. Specific to what we're seeing with our employee delivery, we saw a bout two times the penetration that we had in Q1 - in Q4, excuse me, into Q1. And what those employees are trained to, they're mostly actually supporting our next day capabilities, and it's actually kind of a surprise and delight moment. They're able to leverage some of the extra capacity, they're driving around the neighborhoods near the store. They're able to walk up deliver that package. And typically, the customer feedback we hear is, I wasn't expecting a Blue Shirt necessarily to come walking up with a package and deliver it safely to my home. So I think it's a way for us to leverage the brand and the unique aspects of our Blue Shirts, but also do with some level of convenience. Mike, do you have something to add? Thank you. I think it's a little bit potentially about both, but I'd argue right now, a little bit more of the latter, where we're trying to figure out what's the right mix of having those distribution facilities that deliver with convenience. But also enough touch points, importantly, so that you also are able to meet the customer expectations. I mean, when still 60% of what we sell is either being picked up in a store or shipped from a store that in-store capability is incredibly important to the customer experience. And so, I will start with where I did in the prepared remarks and that is our number one goal is to ensure seamless customer experiences. And as we said, our customers look to us for everything from inspiration and support, all the way to that really convenient fulfillment opportunity. And so the goal of the test right now is to say, what is the right balance between that really deep experiential selling square footage, that fulfillment square footage that might be behind the scenes. And one of the things that you didn't quite get in the prepared remarks is that often, you might have a little bit less selling square footage, but all the SKUs are available in the back because it's like a mini fulfillment center, so you can still deliver on the customer experiences. And so it's - right now, it's about trying to test how do all these things play together and then what's the right balance that delivers importantly on the customer expectations over time. Thank you. You bet. I'd start by just reinforcing kind of where I ended the last question and that is we're testing for the right mix of experience, space, and location. And all those things need to play together in the right way. We obviously feel urgency. We want to make sure that we figure this out. But we don't want to be so urgent that we risk the customer and thankfully also the employee experience in this work. And it's important to note, we're not even in a normalized environment yet, right? We still have the impacts of COVID. You have stimulus like there's a lot of things still impacting shopping behavior, which means you don't want to take a false read, and then roll some of these out. And then even the full market tests that I was talking about on the call, that's set to launch in the back half of this year. So we haven't even started the launch on that one. So we don't have anything to announce today. We wanted to start to give you more clarity on the true impacts we're trying to test the true market level test that we're doing. And we want to make sure wasn't just seen as done [ph] the fulfillment inside that is also the new experiential aspects that we're adding. And I think we would say we have a pretty good history of rolling out concepts as soon as we feel like we have the right case sitting behind them. And so, as we know more about and feel like we have a sustained understanding of what each of these concepts does for the customer and the employee, then we'll come back to you with the more distinct rollout plans. Mike? Yeah. Yeah, Scott. Thanks for the question. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have definitely said that we've seen at least some spotty inventory shortages. And so obviously, to your point, the team has done an amazing job navigating an environment where they can drive a 37% comp. And our days of supply have been improving throughout the quarter, and we think they'll continue to improve into Q2. But given the unprecedented demand and some of the production disruptions, we have seen constraints, particularly in appliances, computing, TVs. And then we've talked about gaming, obviously, which has been a bit spotty. We're seeing some of that disruption driven by really four things. You've got raw materials and production capacity. You've got the very well-documented chip shortages. You've got port and container constraints and delays. And then ultimately, over all of that is this kind of sustained unprecedented, truly global demand in our space. And I think what's interesting about our business is we have a high degree of transferability. Meaning because we are a special PCE player, especially if you come into the store, but I would argue in our digital properties, we can help you navigate what exactly you are looking for, and then what are the variety of products that might meet your needs. So if you come in for a certain SKU, Scott, as an example, we'll have an associate there who might say, we don't have that one, but here is another SKU that will meet your same needs, same size TV, same spec, that kind of thing. And so I think that helps us navigate this inventory situation in a way that's a little bit different than others. And like I said, I think we're going to continue we believe, to see some level of inventory constraints likely in pockets throughout the rest of the year, assuming that you kind of continue to see the sustained level of demand. But I'm very proud and impress the way the team is navigating through it. And then the last thing I would say before we got is, our inventory is also in the best situation, I see that in terms of at [ph] risk. It's very clean inventory. Much of it is new. It's turning really fast, like Matt said. So it's actually some of the highest inventory quality we've ever seen. You bet. No. I would just underscore. I think we are seeing a huge refresh right now as Mike said, and it's still not done. And demand for PC gaming and crypto and graphics cards remains really high as well. So it's a broad category, when we talk about it. And so I think you are still going to see a population that likely is going to be living some hybrid [ph] life for the foreseeable future and I think the refresh cycle as a result are going to continue to speed up as people look forward that new and better way for them to work-from-home, school-from-home and continue actually the stream-from-home in some cases. So yeah, obviously it's been six quarters of positive comp growth, but we continue to see a real demand for the continued innovation of the products. I think before our recorded history. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Thank you. And with that, I think that's our last question. Thank you so much for joining us today. And I hope that many of our investors listening today are able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 16. Thanks so much, and have a great day."

Please note this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Mollie O'Brien, to begin today's conference. Thank you. \nMollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt  Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  \n Later today, we will post a third-party transcript of this call to our Investor Relations website as well as a financial recap slide presentation.  \n I will now turn the call over to Corie. \nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting Q4 sales results in line with our expectations and better-than-expected profitability. We knew customers would be looking for joy during the holiday but would also be seeking great value given the pressures of inflation. Consumers responded to our compelling deals, and as we predicted, their shopping patterns were more similar to historical holiday periods than what we saw the last 2 years. Specifically, customer shopping activity was more concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last 2 weeks of December than last year. Customers continue to choose us for the expertise, service and overall value we provide across all channels. Our customer satisfaction scores indicate that our talented teams and omnichannel capabilities delivered better experiences during the critical holiday period this year compared to both last year and the prepandemic fourth quarter of fiscal '20, especially within our services and delivery experiences.  \n Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance. Each and every day, our management team and employees across the company are making tough trade-off decisions. Our Q4 comparable sales were down 9.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8% was higher than expected. The promotional environment in the fourth quarter was more intense than last year. However, the related financial pressure was less than expected and contributed to a stronger gross profit rate performance.  \n As a reminder, we first began to see promotional activity return in the back half of calendar 2021. Since then, it has proliferated across categories, and we would characterize the promotional environment for consumer electronics as essentially normalized back to prepandemic 2019 at this point.  \n We continue to manage our inventory very effectively and are focused on maintaining targeted weeks of supply that we believe are appropriate for the current business trends. Our inventory at the end of Q4 was down 14% from the fourth quarter of last year and is essentially in line with our sales trajectory versus prepandemic fiscal '20. From a merchandising perspective, the largest impacts to our domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, appliances and mobile phones, partially offset by growth in gaming and tablets.  \n Our organics were similar to last quarter with our blended average selling price, or ASP, down low single digits on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we start the year until we lap the full return of promotional activity that occurred in the second half of last year. Compared to fiscal '20, ASPs continue to be quite a bit higher, and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. As we've shared previously, this is due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points.  \n I am proud of our team's execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers, while also managing the business for future growth, during what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry.  \n As we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued volatility, and we are preparing for another down year for the CE industry. We are expecting the most comparable sales pressure in the first quarter as year-over-year compares ease through the year. Based on what we can see right now, we believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. There are several factors driving the expected return of industry growth, which could occur next year depending on the macro environment. First, we continue to see evidence that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products and consumers' health. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in 2019. And consumers indicate that more of their tech purchases are need-based than want based.  \n For example, in our recent surveys, the majority of consumers indicated that most tech purchases are for functional reasons versus emotional ones. Second, we will start to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech [ bot  ] early when the pandemic kick in, possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every 3 to 7 years depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle and home theater and large appliances towards the higher end of that range. \n Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely sum we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant, driving interest, upgrades and experimentation. That innovation has largely been paused since the pandemic began and the focus shifted to production. And we believe there will be a desire from our vendor partners to stimulate those replacement cycles or build completely new categories going forward.  \n Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time. For example, cloud and augmented reality will increasingly lead to new capabilities and customer experiences. The cloud solves significant customer pain points by making it much easier and faster to transfer your data and existing device preferences to the next generation of product, which creates customer interest in upgrading more frequently.  \n In the augmented reality space, we believe significant developments are coming that will generate dramatic change in many products over time. Also, the recent government infrastructure funding allocated to expand broadband Internet access to more Americans provides additional support for these macro trends and incremental access to broadband is proven to help fuel tech demand. And as we noted, since the beginning of the pandemic, the vendor community has been more focused on making product rather than refreshing product. And we believe the industry will get back to more of a normalized pace of meaningful innovation towards the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024.  \n Specific innovation we expect to see this year in our larger product categories include dual-screen and foldable laptops in computing and personalization in large appliances. In home theater, beyond traditional panel innovation, we're seeing more of a lifestyle type approach to innovation. For example, there's growing popularity of new high-performance audio and video products, including TVs, projectors and speakers that more seamlessly blend into a room versus older technology that takes up a substantially larger physical footprint in the home.  \n While all our product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging. We are the CE experts and the best place for customers to see existing and new tech and get advice and support.  \n In our August 2020 earnings call, during the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts the customer entirely in control to shop how they want. And our strategy was to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. With that as a backdrop, we are building out our suite of unique assets that deliver customer experiences no one else can, and that we believe makes us the compelling retailer of the future. \n As we do this, we are carefully balancing our short- and long-term initiatives given the volatile environment. There are 5 main areas we are strategically focused on. We will not dive deeply into all of them today: one, evolving our omnichannel retail model; two, building customer relationships through membership; three, incubating and growing Best Buy Health; four, removing costs and improving efficiency and effectiveness; and five, unlocking reverse secondary market opportunities.  \n I will now provide more detail on the evolution of our omnichannel retail map. In fiscal '23, digital sales comprised 33% of our domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. Sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained significantly higher. Even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation. Not only it's 67% of our domestic revenue transacted in our stores, more than half of our identified customers engage in cross-channel shopping experiences. \n And of course, more than 40% of online sales are picked up in stores. Further, we play an incredibly important role for our vendors as the only national CE specialty retailer who can showcase their products and help commercialize their new technology. We were already a leading omnichannel retailer heading into the pandemic. However, we knew that in order to stay relevant in an increasingly digital age, we needed to evolve our omnichannel retail model strategy. And within that, our portfolio of stores needed to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment.  \n We also needed them to become more cost efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. Over the past 3 years, we have been optimizing our store staffing model to reflect the changes in customer shopping behavior and to fuel investments in higher wages. We have also been rapidly testing different store formats and operating models. \n During those 3 years, we closed approximately 70 large format stores, or 7%, including 17 closing this week through our normal stringent lease review process. At the same time, we opened 4 new stores, including new smaller store formats and relocated 6 stores. In addition, we completed 44 remodels to our 35,000 square foot experienced store format. Finally, we boosted our technology development and our digital tools, including our app, to drive customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and increased efficiency in our stores.  \n Now I would like to provide our high-level plans to refresh our U.S. store portfolio over the long term. We will continue to close an average of 15 to 20 traditional large-format stores per year through our normal lease review process. We will also continue to scale our experienced store remodels. As we have shared previously, this format has more premium experiences in a 35,000-square-foot selling area, showcasing the very best of Best Buy. \n We will decrease the selling square footage and adjust the assortment and merchandising strategy in many of our stores. The shift to digital sales and the resulting lower in-store revenue, in addition to a much larger percent of high ASP appliances sales, has pressured our operating model and working capital. For context, roughly 80% of the SKUs we display on our sales floor sell one or fewer per week. In these core medium-sized stores, some of the selling square footage will be shifted into larger backrooms. So the total square footage of these stores is not expected to change materially. Our stores have multiple purposes now, and a larger backroom provides better support for other capabilities like our high rate of in-store pickup of online orders.  \n In addition, we see significant opportunity to leverage these larger store warehouses and our supply chain expertise to help our vendor community fulfill a larger portion of their direct-to-consumer channel. In addition, we will open more outlet stores that support our value-focused customers. These stores are driving a higher mix of new and reengaged customers in addition to a better financial recovery on open box and return product. \n Over time, we believe we can also leverage these outlet locations to help our vendor community with their own open box and refurbished goods that are coming from other channels. As it relates to our small format pilots that focus on tech Essentials, we will continue to monitor them to determine the go-forward plan. We believe there is an opportunity for these to be growth vehicles in underserved urban neighborhoods as well as small remote markets. We're utilizing a market-based approach to evolve our stores. This means we're moving away from a one-size-fits-all model to a portfolio comprised of store formats and fulfillment solutions appropriately sized and working together to efficiently serve our market.  \n From a timing perspective, as you would expect, we're going to phase these changes in line with how the business evolves. We view our store portfolio evolution as a long-range rolling plan, continually making adjustments each year with a sustainable annual investment over time. For fiscal '24 specifically, our plans include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 experienced store remodels and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. In addition, we plan to complete 2 remodels of our medium core format. \n We expect to incur approximately $200 million in capital expenditures for both these physical store changes and routine store resets and maintenance. This is down approximately $100 million from last year. Of course, at the same time, we will continue to evolve our operating model to match the lower selling square footage and the ongoing evolution of our business model. Over the past 3 years, our overall head count has declined by approximately 25,000 people, or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility.  \n Our most recent restructuring activities will allow us to invest more in our customer-facing labor and at the same time, drive increased ability to flex labor spend with revenue fluctuations. Stepping back, we expect the evolution of our store portfolio and operating model to drive sales lift and efficiencies over time. Most importantly, these changes are necessary to relieve the pressures of a changing world, a world in which customers are in control and increasingly more digital and the cost to operate physical stores such as rent and labor are not likely going to come down.  \n Now I'd like to talk about membership and its role in driving deeper relationships with our customers. As we said last quarter, in fiscal 2024, we will continue to iterate our programs based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. I'll start with an update on our entry tier of membership are my Best Buy program. For context, we have approximately 100 million members, with 40 million to 45 million members active per year. \n My Best Buy has long been a points-based loyalty program. The efficacy of points programs has been declining over time as we analyze the data and talk to our customers, we found free shipping resonated even more than 1% back on their purchases. As a result, earlier this year, we added free shipping for all purchases with no minimum purchase. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit cards. \n Our credit card members will continue to earn 5% back in rewards on their purchases at Best Buy in addition to flexible financing options. Thus far, feedback indicates that the changes are resonating with our customers. Moving on to TotalTech, our comprehensive paid membership that includes 24/7 technical support, product protection for all your tech products, special member pricing and much more. We launched it, knowing it was a bold new membership program, unlike anything else in the retail industry.  \n Our investment thesis remains very much intact. Members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy and buying more cross-category than nonmembers. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our Net Promoter Scores from TotalTech members remain considerably higher than nonmembers. Like we did with My Best Buy, we have been studying these customers closely in the first year of the program to really understand what drives not just acquisition, but engagement with us. \n We're going to use that data to evolve our membership proposition. For example, we will tailor the offer with the intention of retaining customers at increasingly higher levels, and, at the same time, explore a tiered approach that may resonate with an even bigger population of customers.  \n We mentioned on our November call that we plan to iterate in ways that reduce the cost to serve, and we're leveraging member usage and retention data to do so. We've made 2 small changes already with more planned this year. These 2 changes were adding back restocking fees for certain product returns and removing free same-day delivery as a benefit.  \n From a financial perspective, we lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact late in Q3, and the program had a neutral year-over-year impact on Q4. We expect membership to contribute to operating income rate expansion from here as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In fiscal '24 specifically, we expect our membership program changes, including My Best Buy changes, to drive approximately 25 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion, which will primarily be in the back half of the year. We expect to share more details on the coming plan changes on our May call.  \n Transitioning to Best Buy Health. The role of technology within healthcare is becoming more important than ever, and our strategy is to enable care at home for everyone. In fiscal '24, we expect to grow Best Buy Health sales faster than the base business. We also expect to drive a higher mix of our more profitable and unique service plans and deliver cost optimization in our active aging business. \n We expect these initiatives to drive approximately 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion. I want to spend a few minutes on our Care at Home solution that leverages current health, our leading technology platform that brings together remote patient monitoring, telehealth, a full support model and patient engagement into a single solution for health care providers and pharmaceutical companies.  \n Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking year ever last year, and we now have relationships with 5 of the top 10 largest health systems in the U.S. These names include Geisinger, Mount Sinai Health System, NYU Langone Health and others. 40% of our provider clients launched in Q4, demonstrating our momentum.  \n We also just began a 3-year development partnership with Advocate Health. This partnership will leverage Advocate Health's nationally leading hospital-at-home-program, providing care to a population of over 6 million people and Best Buy's technology expertise. Together, we will develop enhanced capabilities and better patient experiences for both Advocate Health and other health systems around the [ company.  ] We are excited about the momentum of Care at Home, but it is still a nascent emerging part of the healthcare industry. \n We are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and leveraging Best Buy's core assets, including the Geek Squad to incubate a new business. The revenue contribution is currently very small and will take time to ramp as the Care at Home space matures and expands over the coming years.  \n Before turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and communities we serve. We know our employees and the expert service they provide are our core competitive differentiator, and we are maniacally focused on driving positive employee experience and engagement. Of course, the competitive compensation continues to be table stakes, and we've increased our store associate hourly pay approximately 25% in the last 3 years.\n Additionally, external research supports our belief that employees are increasingly prioritizing human factors of their jobs, including well-being, work life balance, career development and culture, our unique way of managing our portfolio of employee benefits coupled with the intentional approach to provide ladder and lattice career movement at all levels helps counteract the market pressures of rising wage rates in retail. We serve customers in a multitude of ways, in store, in home and virtually, providing many opportunities for employees to upskill and reskill and ultimately choose the path that's right for them at Best Buy.  \n 60% of our general managers started at Best Buy  in non-leadership role, and 94% of our general managers and assistant managers here today were hired internally. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry.  \n From a community standpoint, we finished the year with 52 Best Buy team tech centers and are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of 100. These centers continue to provide young people in our communities with the access, inspiration and opportunity they deserve to help them define their futures. I am proud to say that Best Buy continues to be recognized for the many ways we are supporting our employees and communities. In Q4, we ranked 34th and were the #1 retailer on the Just Capital list that evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. in part on how a company invests in its workers, supports its communities and minimizes environmental impact.  \n In summary, we believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with focus on our strategic initiatives.  \n The structural hypothesis we laid out in our investor update last year remains true. There are more technology products than ever in people's home. Technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we uniquely are there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space. We are in this for the long term and believe our purpose to enrich lives through technology is only more relevant in the future.  \n I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter financials and fiscal '24 outlook. \nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our fourth quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $14.7 billion, declined 9.3% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8%, declined 30 basis points compared to last year, which is an improvement from previous trends as this was the first full quarter of lapping the rollout of our TotalTech membership offering. Non-GAAP SG&A was $241 million lower than last year and increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61, decreased 4%. The year-over-year decline in our earnings per share was driven by the lower operating income dollars I just mentioned, which were partially offset by a $0.19 per share benefit from a lower share count, a $0.06 per share benefit from higher interest income and a $0.05 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate.  \n While our sales results were down to last year, overall, they aligned very closely with our expectations entering the quarter, including our assumptions on the monthly phasing and the mix of revenue by channel. Our non-GAAP operating income performance exceeded our expectations due to the higher gross profit rate, which included slightly less pressure from promotions than we had expected.  \n Next, I will walk through the details on our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 9.8% to $13.5 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.6%. Online revenue of 38% of our total domestic revenue, which was 12th consecutive quarter that our online sales mix was above 30%. \n As expected, December comparable sales decline of approximately 8% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis. When comparing to the prepandemic fiscal '20 comparable period, January was our best performing month and the only fiscal month that had positive growth. Our domestic gross profit rate declined 20 basis points, primarily due to lower product margin rates, which were partially offset by favorable service margin rates and the higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement.  \n The improved service margin rate included a favorable $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $224 million on lower store payroll cost, reduced incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $90 million this quarter and $455 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense was once again favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales.  \n Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of ongoing changes in our business trends, earlier in fiscal '23, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $86 million of such restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and $147 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. Since we started our Renew Blue transformation 10 years ago, we have been committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set in 2019 was to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25.  \n During fiscal '23, we reached our $1 billion target. These efforts highlight how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Savings from these initiatives are being used to help offset higher labor costs, depreciation and the add-back of incentive compensation.  \n Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash. As Corie mentioned, our year-end inventory balance was approximately 14% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During fiscal '23, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. This morning, we announced that we are increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share, which is a 5% increase. This increase represents the tenth straight year of raising our regular quarterly dividend. After pausing share repurchases earlier this year, we resumed in November and ended the year with $1 billion in repurchases.  \n During fiscal '23, our total capital expenditures were $930 million versus $737 million in the prior year, mainly due to increased store-related investments. Looking to fiscal '24, as Corie discussed, store-related investments are planned to decrease approximately $100 million compared to fiscal '23.  \n Let me next share more color on our outlook for fiscal '24, starting with the 53rd week that will occur in the fourth quarter. We expect the extra week in fiscal '24 to add approximately $700 million in revenue and provide a benefit to our full year non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 10 basis points. The higher operating income rate is primarily driven by the added leverage on SG&A for items such as occupancy and depreciation, which are not impacted by the extra week. As a reminder, the revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales.  \n Moving on to our full year fiscal '24 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion, Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to down 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $850 million. We expect to repurchase shares during fiscal '24, however, we are not providing a target today. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress throughout the year.  \n Lastly, we expect interest income to exceed interest expense this year.  \n Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance, starting with our top line outlook. As we enter the new fiscal year, the consumer electronics industry continues to feel the effects of a broader macro environment. At the high end of our guidance range, we expect comparable sales to be approximately flat as we exit the year. The low end of our guide reflects a scenario where the consumer spending regresses even further from our current levels and lasts longer into the year.  \n Moving next to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating income rate is expected to decline next year due to the SG&A leverage on expected sales decline. We are expecting to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives. \n First, as Corie discussed, the planned changes to our membership offerings are expected to improve our gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points. Second, we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment and our omnichannel operations. Third, continued growth in Best Buy Health is also expected to contribute to gross profit rate expansion. Lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year.  \n Now moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to fiscal '23. As we have shared in prior quarters, we expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million. Store payroll expense, which includes continued investments in store wages, is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales.  \n Lastly, as you would expect, our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends.  \n Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 10%, which is similar to our revenue trends during the first 4 weeks of the quarter. We expect our operating income rate to decline at the lower -- as the lower revenue delevers on SG&A dollars that are similar to last year. We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, with the expansion slightly below the full year outlook I just shared.  \n I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first caller, please go ahead. First caller, please ask your question. \nMichael Lasser: It's Michael Lasser from UBS. Corie, you're making all these changes, it seems like in response just to the evolution of the business where, prior to the pandemic, e-commerce penetration was 20%. Now, it's in the 30% range and that inherently changes the profitability of the Enterprise. So the question is, how do you balance maintaining a strong customer experience, while trying to restore the overall margin level back to where it was prior to the pandemic?  \n And how much customer erosion and sales erosion are you anticipating this year with all the changes that you're making to some of the membership programs? \nCorie Barry: So the purpose of the changes we're making is, first and foremost, to meet a changing customer. And that's why my -- I led even in my remarks around the measurement of our customer experiences and how across the board in Q4, we have actually continued to see improvement in NPS and the measurement of those experiences. The primary goal, of course, is to create customer experiences that people love. And when they want to come to the store, to meet their needs in the moment, sometimes -- and this is part of what's changed. Sometimes that is I want very rapid fulfillment of my product. I want to pick up in store and have the confidence of grabbing that product. \n Sometimes that is, \"I want a deeper, more immersive experience.\" And what we're learning our way through it is part of why we've done piloting and testing, and we're taking a long time to make changes, or what sometimes we get feedback seems like a long time to make changes is because we want to give this enough room to breathe, to make sure we feel like we're not eroding the customer experience. It's why we are investing more in our frontline associates, who are the ones who are right there meeting the customer in the moment.  \n And so our priority is not just the cost side. Our priority is actually what does the experience of the future need to look like so that we meet the customer expectations, and we hold ourselves very accountable to the measurement of those experiences.  \n On the membership side -- and we talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks, what we're trying to figure out is the balance between acquisition of members but also retention of members. And what are those experiences, again, that really keep customers sticky? I mean the whole point of a great membership program is that you remain relevant to your customer base. And now -- I mean it's only been a year. And again, we have relatively low frequency with our customers. And so we're just getting data around what is it that keeps someone frequently enacting with Best Buy. And so it's changes to TotalTech but I think you heard us also mention in there, we see the opportunity potentially for another tier that might be a little bit more value-oriented, might be a little bit more convenience-oriented, but might have broader appeal.  \n And so I think what we're trying to do is, that's why we also brought my Best Buy into the conversation, we're looking across the entire gamut of what we think we can provide our customers and see the opportunity for a tiered approach all the way from free where you get free shipping, which is really resonating, all the way up to a very comprehensive membership program like TotalTech where you get everything around support. So the goal here, Mike, at the end of the day is to deliver the best possible customer experiences that are important in a new world where a customer is shopping differently. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. My follow-up question is, quarter-to-date, you're trending down 10%. You are expecting within the guidance to be flat by the end of the year. So is the progression from down 10% to flat, is that linear, so we should be expecting steady improvements over the course of the year? And what is -- what is that dependent on in terms of product introductions, execution and the competitive environment? \nMatthew Bilunas: Thank you, Michael. As you said, our guide prudently assumes that inflation persists and the consumers are going -- be continued to make trade-offs around their spend. And so at a high end, the comps progressively improved throughout the year. And like I said, we will exit the year more on the flat to slightly possibly growing as the pressures in the CE industry kind of abate as we progress through the year. So maybe not perfectly linear, but we do expect that at the high end, the sales performance would progressively improve.  \n At the low end of the guide, we're clearly modeling a more sustained pressure on the CE industry as customers feel the longer effects of the macro pressures of inflation that continue to shift some spend to the activities in travel. So that's kind of the 2 ends of our expectations for next year. But again, at the high end, we do expect our sales and the industry itself to improve as the year progresses, which is consistent actually with what -- some external benchmarking you would look at between NPD and CTA, which would also expect some level of improvement. \nOperator: Next caller, please, state your name and company name before asking your question. \nKaren Short: It's Karen Short from Credit Suisse. So I have 2 questions. I guess the first question is just, obviously, the midpoint of your sales guide is $1 billion above calendar '19, but EBIT margins are 100 basis points below. So again, calendar '19, but promos seem to be likely consistent in '20 -- calendar '23 relative to 2019. So can you just elaborate on that a little bit?  \n And then with respect to the members that you called out, $100 million is clearly a very strong number in terms of members for My Best Buy, TotalTech. Can you just give a little color on what percent of sales those members represent? And then maybe some color on how you could better leverage that program? \nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. I'll start and then Corie can jump in too. I think the comparison you're talking about is this year compared to FY '20 -- or calendar 2019, if you think about our business -- for me the biggest change from this past year to 2019 is within gross margin in the 2 very big factors that have lower gross margin since that time are: one, supply chain costs that are much higher. Part of that is the online mix that has grown, and the other part of that would be supply chain inflation that hopefully, we would see abate over time. \n The second biggest impact to gross margin has been our rollout of the membership offering, which, during the quarters last year, when we weren't fully lapped, it was almost 100 basis points of pressure compared on a year-over-year basis. So those are the biggest impacts compared to that 2019 period, which was gross margin...\n SG&A was -- rate was rather similar to 2019. And so what you do have there is you have savings compared to store labor being down. And then you have offsetting that a bit is the investments we've been making in technology and depreciation coming through from higher capital. \nCorie Barry: On the membership side, let me make sure I clarify the numbers. We have about 100 million My Best Buy members, of which 40 million to 45 million are active. On the TotalTech side, we currently have 5.8 million members. That's compared to 4.6 million we had last year. So those are kind of the 2 pools of membership that we're talking about. And we haven't given the percent of sales of those members, but you can imagine, it's a fairly high percent of sales between those 2 membership pools.  \n I think we see a lot of opportunity to continue to engage with those members. As you can imagine, with a My Best Buy program that large, we know a lot about those customers. And we are able to tailor to those customers. We know even more about our TotalTech members, of course. And I think we see a future where we're able to tailor more direct opportunities, sales opportunities with them. We also can see potentially that if we look at a tiered approach, there's a whole another tranche of customers who might be interested in doing more with us and having a longer relationship with us.  \n And now as we're heading during the second year of TotalTech, we're learning a lot. We think we're going to drive more engagement through a more personalized approach. We're working on our onboarding process for new members so they really understand what's available to them. And we're leveraging some of our existing vehicles so that people understand everything that we do from consultations, all the way through services, all the way through trade-in and some of the other offers. And then, of course, this speeds into some of our Best Buy Ads model, where we can tailor our advertising to specific audiences based on what we know about them. So this pool of customers is really vital to us, and I think we are continuing to improve the way we engage with them, and also drive their engagement back with us. \nKaren Short: Any chance you could just tease out a renewal rates? \nCorie Barry: We haven't given renewals, and we're not going to. And as you can imagine -- I mean they've been relatively in line with our expectations. You can imagine, there are some places where we see much better engagement and renewals and people who engage in things like support or who value the warranty side of TotalTech as an example, they are very, very interested in renewing. And so I think that's -- when we talk about tailoring the program for the future, we're looking for those customers who find value in some of the more unique aspects of the program and stick with the program because they see the value in that. \nOperator: Next caller, please go ahead. \nSeth Sigman: It's Seth Sigman from Barclays. Nice to talk to you. My first question is just around pricing and the promotional environment. I think the point that you made is that Q4 actually ended up being a little bit less promotional. Can you just elaborate on that? And then as you think about this calendar year, it does seem like a lot of retailers are planning conservatively in this category. I guess what have you reflected here in the guidance for gross margin specifically related to discounting and promotional activity? \nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. Just to recap, in Q4, we did see product margin rates lower in Q4, driven by on a year-over-year basis of more promotionality. What we did see compared to expectations is actually a little less pressure from promotionality even though we were expecting it to be more promotional year-over-year. As we look into next year, our guide reflects, I think, it's -- one of my comments in prepared remarks was the combination of product margin rates, [ city ] profit share and supply chain, we're going to be pretty neutral to the whole year. That doesn't mean that in some quarters, it might be a little better, a little worse. But for the most part, next year, we're assuming that it's a fairly neutral impact of [ a broad ] promotionality, not that some quarters might also be more promotional from a pricing perspective, the impact of that promotionality might not actually manifest in the financial pressure. \nSeth Sigman: Okay. And then I guess, just thinking about demand in general, there's obviously a few factors battling each other here. There's a lot of consumer noise. You also have pull forward in your category. You talked about replacement cycles. I guess I'm just trying to think about elasticity as you start to see ASPs come down, and we can't really see it on a category level, we only see it in aggregate. But are there any signs of maybe elasticity starting to kick in here? Just curious how you're thinking about that. \nCorie Barry: Yes. I think you started with what makes the conversation a little bit difficult, which is the incredibly varied indicator that are out there with the consumer right now, right? Everything from historically strong job markets, spending continues specifically on services even more so than goods. Inflation might be slowing, but it still is sustainably high. \n And it's high in some of the basics like food, fuel and lodging, right? And when the basics are where that sustainable inflation is, it does mean the customer is going to make trade-off decisions. And I think we've used the same language now for probably 3 quarters. You've got an uneven and unsettled consumer who, from a confidence perspective looking forward, is still not confident about the future. And so I think what we are trying to position ourselves for is the best possible value for that consumer when they're ready in the moment. And I feel like in Q4, I think we've played that very well. \n Our pricing was very competitive. Our price perception was very competitive. And so you can see in spot as there is a better deal to be had, you can see the consumer reacting. But no matter what, it's against this overlay of a consumer who's going to make trade-off decisions based on their own budget and their own life. \nOperator: Next caller, please go ahead. \nSteven Forbes: It's Steven Forbes from Guggenheim. Corie, Matt, I wanted to focus on trends within consumer electronics. If I look at the disclosures here in the press release, obviously, some apparent challenges in that category. So was hoping that you can expand on what you're seeing across the major subcategories within? And then maybe highlight how that is impacting the cadence of comp, right, that you're expecting for 2023? \n I would imagine part of that is improvement within those subcategories. But any color there would be helpful. \nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. I think generally speaking, when you look at 2023, with a minus 3% to minus 6% range, most categories are going to still feel pressure as you look at the year. Most generally would also see a progressive improvement as the year -- at the high end of our range as well. Categories are -- would be very different spots if you think about the last few years. If I think about computing, computing is still a much bigger category compared to where it was prepandemic. It's still seeing more pressure -- compared to the total, just because of the demand it's seen over the last number of years. \n Appliances, again, also a very big category, growing quite a bit over the last number of years as well, seeing a bit of pressure as we start to rightsize some of that spend, but also just as it relates to the housing market being a little pressure, which -- this is a category that does have some impact from that, although a great deal of -- it is still a direct purchase. There is a housing impact. So those -- TVs we would expect actually potentially for that to be a place where we could outperform the company average as we look into this coming year. We -- in Q4, we did see a little bit of ASP pressure. As you look into next year, we believe that potentially could see some opportunity as you get into future quarters. And so those are some of the bigger trends. \n The last one I probably mentioned is mobile phones. It had a sales decline in Q4, which is pretty similar to the company average. And if you compare it to prepandemic, a much smaller category as people are holding on to their phones quite a bit longer than they used to. But as you look into the year against continued improvement generally across a lot of the categories. The one area we have been seeing strength is gaming. We mentioned gaming and tablets as being a growing category in Q4. We are seeing more availability of gaming consoles, which is helping to sales trends. And so potentially an area where we see some more positive as we move into this next year. But again, a lot of that is dependent upon overall all demand as it's getting longer in its launch and availability aspect. \nSteven Forbes: That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, maybe for you, Corie. Curious about vendor conversations today as compared to maybe past cycles or even just the depth of the COVID are -- your comments about helping them with their direct-to-consumer sales, direct-to-consumer open-box returns, et cetera. Maybe just help phrase, right, how the relationships have evolved here, and how you sort of expect them to evolve over the coming quarters and years just given the challenges that are out there? \nCorie Barry: Yes. This is an interesting space for us because obviously, our vendor partners they want to succeed as well. And so when we think about things like promotionality, the question we got earlier around elasticity, these are great partnership discussions that we can have with our vendors as we think about how best to stimulate the market. And I said it a couple of times, but it bears repeating, our vendors are highly incented to continue to innovate on their products and to create the new products for the future. I mean obviously, no one's going to sit on their laurels and wait for the customers to come back. People are constantly trying to innovate in a way that will drive demand. And we are really the best place to highlight particularly that new innovation. And so the vendor partnerships have continued to evolve over time with that as the backdrop. \n I think we often talk about the physical experiences with our vendors, and that remains important. Our partners continue to invest in our existing stores. And I think you can see some really beautiful vendor experiences in the 35,000 square foot remodels that we're doing as well as even some of the smaller stores that we're testing, where you have just a different take on vendor experience. So there still is this real investment and interest in how a vendor shows up in a physical experience. \n But on top of that, there are so many new spaces where we're developing some different and unique partnerships. We have developed some interesting partnerships around our membership offerings. We have developed really interesting partnerships with Best Buy Ads and how they think about the access to the hundreds of millions of customers that we have that we know very well, and they can target very directly. We have deep services partnerships in many cases, we're an Apple authorized repair facility, and we're building out that services infrastructure with other partners. \n And then to your point, we're starting to see some real opportunity in supply chain and fulfillment. We have a program that's called Partner Plus. We currently have 6 partners on it. Samsung is one of those where you can actually order online at Samsung and have it fulfilled in our stores. And I think there are so many spaces, especially in an industry where like we said 40% of what we sell online is picked up in store. So there is this like intricate want and need on our customer base to physically have access to that product, and we can partner pretty uniquely with some of our vendors to help provide that experience for them. And we can see a lot of opportunity for that into our future. \nOperator: Next caller, please go ahead. \nGregory Melich: It's Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Really 2 questions. One, Corie, I think you mentioned that average selling prices are still up from where they were a few years ago. If the 3-year comp is flattish, should we assume that ASPs are maybe up 10% and transactional counts are down 10%. Would that be a fair estimate? \nCorie Barry: Well, we're not going to give the precise numbers, but directionally how you're thinking about it is essentially what we're seeing. And I just want to make sure I underscore 1 more time on the ASP side of things structurally versus calendar 2019 or fiscal 2020, you've really got 2 big things happening. And that is the mix and the category mix is quite different. Larger percent of our revenue now coming from appliances and large TVs. And also second, within our categories, the mix in the premium products has increased. And I think those 2 actually reflect some of the strengths of our model, our ability to really tailor those more premium experiences, our ability to deliver and install that large cube. I think it's -- sometimes it gets a little lost in some of the other inflation conversation. That's not what's happening here. What's happening here is, structurally, we're making what I think are some really positive changes within the business model. \nGregory Melich: Well, I guess that's the natural follow-up. So that's the premiumization with innovation. So I guess as you go through this year in the guide and that improvement in comps from where we are now, is that improvement more based on ASP declines moderating or traffic improving or transactions improving. \nMatthew Bilunas: I think as we go through this coming year, there could be some -- when we start the year, there could be some ASP pressure year-over-year, but not to the extent that we compare it to FY '20, obviously. We believe that will remain elevated. And as you get into the latter part of this year, we'll have to see, but it's probably a bit of growth coming from the industry improving, which means demand is improving, which means it's probably a combination of units improving and potentially, give or take, some ASP increase. Again, we're not guiding it, but we probably see both as you -- our expectation is at the high end is that the industry would continue to grow and demand would come back, which would actually drive more units. \nGregory Melich: And then my follow-up is on services, 5% of revenue. Is that basically TotalTech as a majority of that now? Or how should we think about that in terms of building that side of the business? \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes. TotalTech has become majority of that number as it's -- as we launched that membership program, it's replacing more of the stand-alone services sales that we would have had in the stand-alone warranty sales that we would have had. So we've seen it shift into being a TotalTech more based number. There is still stand-alone services and stand-alone warranty sales, but it's shifted to TotalTech. \nOperator: We will take 1 last question, then hand over to your host to conclude today's conference. Next caller, please go ahead. \nScot Ciccarelli: It's Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. I know that reduction in incentive comp is a big part of the SG&A swing. But domestic SG&A was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis on a high single-digit comp decline. That's not really easy to do. So does that level of austerity, let's call it, create a situation where retention actually starts to become a challenge, especially in an environment where a lot of other retailers are actually talking about accelerating wage pressures in '23 even on top of '22's levels? \nCorie Barry: Yes. So what's been interesting here, and we said it in the prepared remarks, I mean our average hourly wage is up 25% versus 2019. We were one of the first to move our wages up in August of 2020 to $15 minimum almost 3 years ago. And so we've been making continuous investments in our workforce over the last 3 years. And what we're seeing, and we watch it incredibly closely, our turnover rates are really low compared to industry averages, and they're generally very similar year-over-year. And we -- I mean we've talked about it before. We might not be exactly a prepandemic, but we're still in the like mid-30% turnover range overall. And so that is exactly what we watch to make sure we're trying to strike the right balance here. \n We are continuing to invest -- and it's not just wages, it's also hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits over the last 3-year period as well. And of course, we're going to keep monitoring that on a market level basis, but we remain laser-focused on making sure that as we adjust the operating model, we are reinvesting into those employees that we have. And I think, for some of the key roles like our general managers, our turnover is in the mid-single digits, and we tapped before about some of the tenure that we see in our [ peak  ] slot agents or within some of our consultants. So we are very carefully monitoring constantly both the balance of pay and benefits and, frankly, some of the work-life balance and flexibility that our employees are demanding, and we continue to see it reflected, I would argue, in industry-leading turnover numbers. \nScot Ciccarelli: For you when we kind of think about -- this company has taken a lot of cost out over the last, gosh, decade plus [Audio Gap] \nCorie Barry: Model is always evolving, and there are always new and interesting and different ways to take cost out. I would use -- 1 of the things that we've been talking more about lately is outlets. That is a unique and differentiated customer experience. And we're pulling different customers in who are finding great values and we see a recovery rate. We've said this before, that's 2x what we would see if we were selling that sideways or selling it outside our own channel. Cost reduction is not always about expense reduction. \n It is often about finding flaws in the experience and then making opportunity kind of out of those flaws. Many of our cost reduction efforts actually have ended up and, I would argue, better employee and customer experiences. If you take some of the TV damage work that we've done over time, nobody wants to bring home a damaged TV, and there's a huge amount of cost in that for us. And so I think what we are trying to do is continuously assess our model. And then given some of the advancements we're seeing, there continues to be opportunity. We see opportunity ahead in how we run our call centers as an example. And that's a space where we've been able to pull cost out and have better customer NPS and experiences. \n So this isn't -- I think sometimes it's a zero-sum kind of game that people play in their heads with cost reduction. But I think what the team is doing is really creatively finding kind of flaws in our system. And because it's always evolving, there's always something that we're learning from and evolving. So I'm really proud of the work that the team has done, and I think we continue to have opportunity.\n And with that, yes, you bet. I'd love to thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in May. Thank you and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call.

            "name": "Matthew Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our fourth quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $14.7 billion, declined 9.3% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8%, declined 30 basis points compared to last year, which is an improvement from previous trends as this was the first full quarter of lapping the rollout of our TotalTech membership offering. Non-GAAP SG&A was $241 million lower than last year and increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61, decreased 4%. The year-over-year decline in our earnings per share was driven by the lower operating income dollars I just mentioned, which were partially offset by a $0.19 per share benefit from a lower share count, a $0.06 per share benefit from higher interest income and a $0.05 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate.  \n While our sales results were down to last year, overall, they aligned very closely with our expectations entering the quarter, including our assumptions on the monthly phasing and the mix of revenue by channel. Our non-GAAP operating income performance exceeded our expectations due to the higher gross profit rate, which included slightly less pressure from promotions than we had expected.  \n Next, I will walk through the details on our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 9.8% to $13.5 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.6%. Online revenue of 38% of our total domestic revenue, which was 12th consecutive quarter that our online sales mix was above 30%. \n As expected, December comparable sales decline of approximately 8% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis. When comparing to the prepandemic fiscal '20 comparable period, January was our best performing month and the only fiscal month that had positive growth. Our domestic gross profit rate declined 20 basis points, primarily due to lower product margin rates, which were partially offset by favorable service margin rates and the higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement.  \n The improved service margin rate included a favorable $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $224 million on lower store payroll cost, reduced incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $90 million this quarter and $455 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense was once again favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales.  \n Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of ongoing changes in our business trends, earlier in fiscal '23, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $86 million of such restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and $147 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. Since we started our Renew Blue transformation 10 years ago, we have been committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set in 2019 was to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25.  \n During fiscal '23, we reached our $1 billion target. These efforts highlight how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Savings from these initiatives are being used to help offset higher labor costs, depreciation and the add-back of incentive compensation.  \n Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash. As Corie mentioned, our year-end inventory balance was approximately 14% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During fiscal '23, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. This morning, we announced that we are increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share, which is a 5% increase. This increase represents the tenth straight year of raising our regular quarterly dividend. After pausing share repurchases earlier this year, we resumed in November and ended the year with $1 billion in repurchases.  \n During fiscal '23, our total capital expenditures were $930 million versus $737 million in the prior year, mainly due to increased store-related investments. Looking to fiscal '24, as Corie discussed, store-related investments are planned to decrease approximately $100 million compared to fiscal '23.  \n Let me next share more color on our outlook for fiscal '24, starting with the 53rd week that will occur in the fourth quarter. We expect the extra week in fiscal '24 to add approximately $700 million in revenue and provide a benefit to our full year non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 10 basis points. The higher operating income rate is primarily driven by the added leverage on SG&A for items such as occupancy and depreciation, which are not impacted by the extra week. As a reminder, the revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales.  \n Moving on to our full year fiscal '24 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion, Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to down 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $850 million. We expect to repurchase shares during fiscal '24, however, we are not providing a target today. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress throughout the year.  \n Lastly, we expect interest income to exceed interest expense this year.  \n Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance, starting with our top line outlook. As we enter the new fiscal year, the consumer electronics industry continues to feel the effects of a broader macro environment. At the high end of our guidance range, we expect comparable sales to be approximately flat as we exit the year. The low end of our guide reflects a scenario where the consumer spending regresses even further from our current levels and lasts longer into the year.  \n Moving next to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating income rate is expected to decline next year due to the SG&A leverage on expected sales decline. We are expecting to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives. \n First, as Corie discussed, the planned changes to our membership offerings are expected to improve our gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points. Second, we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment and our omnichannel operations. Third, continued growth in Best Buy Health is also expected to contribute to gross profit rate expansion. Lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year.  \n Now moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to fiscal '23. As we have shared in prior quarters, we expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million. Store payroll expense, which includes continued investments in store wages, is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales.  \n Lastly, as you would expect, our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends.  \n Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 10%, which is similar to our revenue trends during the first 4 weeks of the quarter. We expect our operating income rate to decline at the lower -- as the lower revenue delevers on SG&A dollars that are similar to last year. We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, with the expansion slightly below the full year outlook I just shared.  \n I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Thank you, Michael. As you said, our guide prudently assumes that inflation persists and the consumers are going -- be continued to make trade-offs around their spend. And so at a high end, the comps progressively improved throughout the year. And like I said, we will exit the year more on the flat to slightly possibly growing as the pressures in the CE industry kind of abate as we progress through the year. So maybe not perfectly linear, but we do expect that at the high end, the sales performance would progressively improve.  \n At the low end of the guide, we're clearly modeling a more sustained pressure on the CE industry as customers feel the longer effects of the macro pressures of inflation that continue to shift some spend to the activities in travel. So that's kind of the 2 ends of our expectations for next year. But again, at the high end, we do expect our sales and the industry itself to improve as the year progresses, which is consistent actually with what -- some external benchmarking you would look at between NPD and CTA, which would also expect some level of improvement. Sure. I'll start and then Corie can jump in too. I think the comparison you're talking about is this year compared to FY '20 -- or calendar 2019, if you think about our business -- for me the biggest change from this past year to 2019 is within gross margin in the 2 very big factors that have lower gross margin since that time are: one, supply chain costs that are much higher. Part of that is the online mix that has grown, and the other part of that would be supply chain inflation that hopefully, we would see abate over time. \n The second biggest impact to gross margin has been our rollout of the membership offering, which, during the quarters last year, when we weren't fully lapped, it was almost 100 basis points of pressure compared on a year-over-year basis. So those are the biggest impacts compared to that 2019 period, which was gross margin...\n SG&A was -- rate was rather similar to 2019. And so what you do have there is you have savings compared to store labor being down. And then you have offsetting that a bit is the investments we've been making in technology and depreciation coming through from higher capital. Sure. Just to recap, in Q4, we did see product margin rates lower in Q4, driven by on a year-over-year basis of more promotionality. What we did see compared to expectations is actually a little less pressure from promotionality even though we were expecting it to be more promotional year-over-year. As we look into next year, our guide reflects, I think, it's -- one of my comments in prepared remarks was the combination of product margin rates, [ city ] profit share and supply chain, we're going to be pretty neutral to the whole year. That doesn't mean that in some quarters, it might be a little better, a little worse. But for the most part, next year, we're assuming that it's a fairly neutral impact of [ a broad ] promotionality, not that some quarters might also be more promotional from a pricing perspective, the impact of that promotionality might not actually manifest in the financial pressure. Sure. I think generally speaking, when you look at 2023, with a minus 3% to minus 6% range, most categories are going to still feel pressure as you look at the year. Most generally would also see a progressive improvement as the year -- at the high end of our range as well. Categories are -- would be very different spots if you think about the last few years. If I think about computing, computing is still a much bigger category compared to where it was prepandemic. It's still seeing more pressure -- compared to the total, just because of the demand it's seen over the last number of years. \n Appliances, again, also a very big category, growing quite a bit over the last number of years as well, seeing a bit of pressure as we start to rightsize some of that spend, but also just as it relates to the housing market being a little pressure, which -- this is a category that does have some impact from that, although a great deal of -- it is still a direct purchase. There is a housing impact. So those -- TVs we would expect actually potentially for that to be a place where we could outperform the company average as we look into this coming year. We -- in Q4, we did see a little bit of ASP pressure. As you look into next year, we believe that potentially could see some opportunity as you get into future quarters. And so those are some of the bigger trends. \n The last one I probably mentioned is mobile phones. It had a sales decline in Q4, which is pretty similar to the company average. And if you compare it to prepandemic, a much smaller category as people are holding on to their phones quite a bit longer than they used to. But as you look into the year against continued improvement generally across a lot of the categories. The one area we have been seeing strength is gaming. We mentioned gaming and tablets as being a growing category in Q4. We are seeing more availability of gaming consoles, which is helping to sales trends. And so potentially an area where we see some more positive as we move into this next year. But again, a lot of that is dependent upon overall all demand as it's getting longer in its launch and availability aspect. I think as we go through this coming year, there could be some -- when we start the year, there could be some ASP pressure year-over-year, but not to the extent that we compare it to FY '20, obviously. We believe that will remain elevated. And as you get into the latter part of this year, we'll have to see, but it's probably a bit of growth coming from the industry improving, which means demand is improving, which means it's probably a combination of units improving and potentially, give or take, some ASP increase. Again, we're not guiding it, but we probably see both as you -- our expectation is at the high end is that the industry would continue to grow and demand would come back, which would actually drive more units. Yes. TotalTech has become majority of that number as it's -- as we launched that membership program, it's replacing more of the stand-alone services sales that we would have had in the stand-alone warranty sales that we would have had. So we've seen it shift into being a TotalTech more based number. There is still stand-alone services and stand-alone warranty sales, but it's shifted to TotalTech."

We knew customers would be looking for joy during the holiday but would also be seeking great value given the pressures of inflation. Consumers responded to our compelling deals, and as we predicted, their shopping patterns were more similar to historical holiday periods than what we saw the last 2 years. Specifically, customer shopping activity was more concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last 2 weeks of December than last year. Customers continue to choose us for the expertise, service and overall value we provide across all channels. Our customer satisfaction scores indicate that our talented teams and omnichannel capabilities delivered better experiences during the critical holiday period this year compared to both last year and the prepandemic fourth quarter of fiscal '20, especially within our services and delivery experiences.  \n Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance. Each and every day, our management team and employees across the company are making tough trade-off decisions. Our Q4 comparable sales were down 9.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8% was higher than expected. The promotional environment in the fourth quarter was more intense than last year. However, the related financial pressure was less than expected and contributed to a stronger gross profit rate performance.  \n As a reminder, we first began to see promotional activity return in the back half of calendar 2021. Since then, it has proliferated across categories, and we would characterize the promotional environment for consumer electronics as essentially normalized back to prepandemic 2019 at this point.  \n We continue to manage our inventory very effectively and are focused on maintaining targeted weeks of supply that we believe are appropriate for the current business trends. Our inventory at the end of Q4 was down 14% from the fourth quarter of last year and is essentially in line with our sales trajectory versus prepandemic fiscal '20. From a merchandising perspective, the largest impacts to our domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, appliances and mobile phones, partially offset by growth in gaming and tablets.  \n Our organics were similar to last quarter with our blended average selling price, or ASP, down low single digits on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we start the year until we lap the full return of promotional activity that occurred in the second half of last year. Compared to fiscal '20, ASPs continue to be quite a bit higher, and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. As we've shared previously, this is due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points.  \n I am proud of our team's execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers, while also managing the business for future growth, during what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry.  \n As we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued volatility, and we are preparing for another down year for the CE industry. We are expecting the most comparable sales pressure in the first quarter as year-over-year compares ease through the year. Based on what we can see right now, we believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. There are several factors driving the expected return of industry growth, which could occur next year depending on the macro environment. First, we continue to see evidence that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products and consumers' health. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in 2019. And consumers indicate that more of their tech purchases are need-based than want based.  \n For example, in our recent surveys, the majority of consumers indicated that most tech purchases are for functional reasons versus emotional ones. Second, we will start to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech [ bot  ] early when the pandemic kick in, possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every 3 to 7 years depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle and home theater and large appliances towards the higher end of that range. \n Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely sum we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant, driving interest, upgrades and experimentation. That innovation has largely been paused since the pandemic began and the focus shifted to production. And we believe there will be a desire from our vendor partners to stimulate those replacement cycles or build completely new categories going forward.  \n Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time. For example, cloud and augmented reality will increasingly lead to new capabilities and customer experiences. The cloud solves significant customer pain points by making it much easier and faster to transfer your data and existing device preferences to the next generation of product, which creates customer interest in upgrading more frequently.  \n In the augmented reality space, we believe significant developments are coming that will generate dramatic change in many products over time. Also, the recent government infrastructure funding allocated to expand broadband Internet access to more Americans provides additional support for these macro trends and incremental access to broadband is proven to help fuel tech demand. And as we noted, since the beginning of the pandemic, the vendor community has been more focused on making product rather than refreshing product. And we believe the industry will get back to more of a normalized pace of meaningful innovation towards the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024.  \n Specific innovation we expect to see this year in our larger product categories include dual-screen and foldable laptops in computing and personalization in large appliances. In home theater, beyond traditional panel innovation, we're seeing more of a lifestyle type approach to innovation. For example, there's growing popularity of new high-performance audio and video products, including TVs, projectors and speakers that more seamlessly blend into a room versus older technology that takes up a substantially larger physical footprint in the home.  \n While all our product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging. We are the CE experts and the best place for customers to see existing and new tech and get advice and support.  \n In our August 2020 earnings call, during the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts the customer entirely in control to shop how they want. And our strategy was to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. With that as a backdrop, we are building out our suite of unique assets that deliver customer experiences no one else can, and that we believe makes us the compelling retailer of the future. \n As we do this, we are carefully balancing our short- and long-term initiatives given the volatile environment. There are 5 main areas we are strategically focused on. We will not dive deeply into all of them today: one, evolving our omnichannel retail model; two, building customer relationships through membership; three, incubating and growing Best Buy Health; four, removing costs and improving efficiency and effectiveness; and five, unlocking reverse secondary market opportunities.  \n I will now provide more detail on the evolution of our omnichannel retail map. In fiscal '23, digital sales comprised 33% of our domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. Sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained significantly higher. Even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation. Not only it's 67% of our domestic revenue transacted in our stores, more than half of our identified customers engage in cross-channel shopping experiences. \n And of course, more than 40% of online sales are picked up in stores. Further, we play an incredibly important role for our vendors as the only national CE specialty retailer who can showcase their products and help commercialize their new technology. We were already a leading omnichannel retailer heading into the pandemic. However, we knew that in order to stay relevant in an increasingly digital age, we needed to evolve our omnichannel retail model strategy. And within that, our portfolio of stores needed to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment.  \n We also needed them to become more cost efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. Over the past 3 years, we have been optimizing our store staffing model to reflect the changes in customer shopping behavior and to fuel investments in higher wages. We have also been rapidly testing different store formats and operating models. \n During those 3 years, we closed approximately 70 large format stores, or 7%, including 17 closing this week through our normal stringent lease review process. At the same time, we opened 4 new stores, including new smaller store formats and relocated 6 stores. In addition, we completed 44 remodels to our 35,000 square foot experienced store format. Finally, we boosted our technology development and our digital tools, including our app, to drive customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and increased efficiency in our stores.  \n Now I would like to provide our high-level plans to refresh our U.S. store portfolio over the long term. We will continue to close an average of 15 to 20 traditional large-format stores per year through our normal lease review process. We will also continue to scale our experienced store remodels. As we have shared previously, this format has more premium experiences in a 35,000-square-foot selling area, showcasing the very best of Best Buy. \n We will decrease the selling square footage and adjust the assortment and merchandising strategy in many of our stores. The shift to digital sales and the resulting lower in-store revenue, in addition to a much larger percent of high ASP appliances sales, has pressured our operating model and working capital. For context, roughly 80% of the SKUs we display on our sales floor sell one or fewer per week. In these core medium-sized stores, some of the selling square footage will be shifted into larger backrooms. So the total square footage of these stores is not expected to change materially. Our stores have multiple purposes now, and a larger backroom provides better support for other capabilities like our high rate of in-store pickup of online orders.  \n In addition, we see significant opportunity to leverage these larger store warehouses and our supply chain expertise to help our vendor community fulfill a larger portion of their direct-to-consumer channel. In addition, we will open more outlet stores that support our value-focused customers. These stores are driving a higher mix of new and reengaged customers in addition to a better financial recovery on open box and return product. \n Over time, we believe we can also leverage these outlet locations to help our vendor community with their own open box and refurbished goods that are coming from other channels. As it relates to our small format pilots that focus on tech Essentials, we will continue to monitor them to determine the go-forward plan. We believe there is an opportunity for these to be growth vehicles in underserved urban neighborhoods as well as small remote markets. We're utilizing a market-based approach to evolve our stores. This means we're moving away from a one-size-fits-all model to a portfolio comprised of store formats and fulfillment solutions appropriately sized and working together to efficiently serve our market.  \n From a timing perspective, as you would expect, we're going to phase these changes in line with how the business evolves. We view our store portfolio evolution as a long-range rolling plan, continually making adjustments each year with a sustainable annual investment over time. For fiscal '24 specifically, our plans include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 experienced store remodels and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. In addition, we plan to complete 2 remodels of our medium core format. \n We expect to incur approximately $200 million in capital expenditures for both these physical store changes and routine store resets and maintenance. This is down approximately $100 million from last year. Of course, at the same time, we will continue to evolve our operating model to match the lower selling square footage and the ongoing evolution of our business model. Over the past 3 years, our overall head count has declined by approximately 25,000 people, or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility.  \n Our most recent restructuring activities will allow us to invest more in our customer-facing labor and at the same time, drive increased ability to flex labor spend with revenue fluctuations. Stepping back, we expect the evolution of our store portfolio and operating model to drive sales lift and efficiencies over time. Most importantly, these changes are necessary to relieve the pressures of a changing world, a world in which customers are in control and increasingly more digital and the cost to operate physical stores such as rent and labor are not likely going to come down.  \n Now I'd like to talk about membership and its role in driving deeper relationships with our customers. As we said last quarter, in fiscal 2024, we will continue to iterate our programs based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. I'll start with an update on our entry tier of membership are my Best Buy program. For context, we have approximately 100 million members, with 40 million to 45 million members active per year. \n My Best Buy has long been a points-based loyalty program. The efficacy of points programs has been declining over time as we analyze the data and talk to our customers, we found free shipping resonated even more than 1% back on their purchases. As a result, earlier this year, we added free shipping for all purchases with no minimum purchase. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit cards. \n Our credit card members will continue to earn 5% back in rewards on their purchases at Best Buy in addition to flexible financing options. Thus far, feedback indicates that the changes are resonating with our customers. Moving on to TotalTech, our comprehensive paid membership that includes 24/7 technical support, product protection for all your tech products, special member pricing and much more. We launched it, knowing it was a bold new membership program, unlike anything else in the retail industry.  \n Our investment thesis remains very much intact. Members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy and buying more cross-category than nonmembers. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our Net Promoter Scores from TotalTech members remain considerably higher than nonmembers. Like we did with My Best Buy, we have been studying these customers closely in the first year of the program to really understand what drives not just acquisition, but engagement with us. \n We're going to use that data to evolve our membership proposition. For example, we will tailor the offer with the intention of retaining customers at increasingly higher levels, and, at the same time, explore a tiered approach that may resonate with an even bigger population of customers.  \n We mentioned on our November call that we plan to iterate in ways that reduce the cost to serve, and we're leveraging member usage and retention data to do so. We've made 2 small changes already with more planned this year. These 2 changes were adding back restocking fees for certain product returns and removing free same-day delivery as a benefit.  \n From a financial perspective, we lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact late in Q3, and the program had a neutral year-over-year impact on Q4. We expect membership to contribute to operating income rate expansion from here as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In fiscal '24 specifically, we expect our membership program changes, including My Best Buy changes, to drive approximately 25 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion, which will primarily be in the back half of the year. We expect to share more details on the coming plan changes on our May call.  \n Transitioning to Best Buy Health. The role of technology within healthcare is becoming more important than ever, and our strategy is to enable care at home for everyone. In fiscal '24, we expect to grow Best Buy Health sales faster than the base business. We also expect to drive a higher mix of our more profitable and unique service plans and deliver cost optimization in our active aging business. \n We expect these initiatives to drive approximately 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion. I want to spend a few minutes on our Care at Home solution that leverages current health, our leading technology platform that brings together remote patient monitoring, telehealth, a full support model and patient engagement into a single solution for health care providers and pharmaceutical companies.  \n Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking year ever last year, and we now have relationships with 5 of the top 10 largest health systems in the U.S. These names include Geisinger, Mount Sinai Health System, NYU Langone Health and others. 40% of our provider clients launched in Q4, demonstrating our momentum.  \n We also just began a 3-year development partnership with Advocate Health. This partnership will leverage Advocate Health's nationally leading hospital-at-home-program, providing care to a population of over 6 million people and Best Buy's technology expertise. Together, we will develop enhanced capabilities and better patient experiences for both Advocate Health and other health systems around the [ company.  ] We are excited about the momentum of Care at Home, but it is still a nascent emerging part of the healthcare industry. \n We are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and leveraging Best Buy's core assets, including the Geek Squad to incubate a new business. The revenue contribution is currently very small and will take time to ramp as the Care at Home space matures and expands over the coming years.  \n Before turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and communities we serve. We know our employees and the expert service they provide are our core competitive differentiator, and we are maniacally focused on driving positive employee experience and engagement. Of course, the competitive compensation continues to be table stakes, and we've increased our store associate hourly pay approximately 25% in the last 3 years.\n Additionally, external research supports our belief that employees are increasingly prioritizing human factors of their jobs, including well-being, work life balance, career development and culture, our unique way of managing our portfolio of employee benefits coupled with the intentional approach to provide ladder and lattice career movement at all levels helps counteract the market pressures of rising wage rates in retail. We serve customers in a multitude of ways, in store, in home and virtually, providing many opportunities for employees to upskill and reskill and ultimately choose the path that's right for them at Best Buy.  \n 60% of our general managers started at Best Buy  in non-leadership role, and 94% of our general managers and assistant managers here today were hired internally. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry.  \n From a community standpoint, we finished the year with 52 Best Buy team tech centers and are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of 100. These centers continue to provide young people in our communities with the access, inspiration and opportunity they deserve to help them define their futures. I am proud to say that Best Buy continues to be recognized for the many ways we are supporting our employees and communities. In Q4, we ranked 34th and were the #1 retailer on the Just Capital list that evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. in part on how a company invests in its workers, supports its communities and minimizes environmental impact.  \n In summary, we believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with focus on our strategic initiatives.  \n The structural hypothesis we laid out in our investor update last year remains true. There are more technology products than ever in people's home. Technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we uniquely are there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space. We are in this for the long term and believe our purpose to enrich lives through technology is only more relevant in the future.  \n I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter financials and fiscal '24 outlook. So the purpose of the changes we're making is, first and foremost, to meet a changing customer. And that's why my -- I led even in my remarks around the measurement of our customer experiences and how across the board in Q4, we have actually continued to see improvement in NPS and the measurement of those experiences. The primary goal, of course, is to create customer experiences that people love. And when they want to come to the store, to meet their needs in the moment, sometimes -- and this is part of what's changed. Sometimes that is I want very rapid fulfillment of my product. I want to pick up in store and have the confidence of grabbing that product. \n Sometimes that is, \"I want a deeper, more immersive experience.\" And what we're learning our way through it is part of why we've done piloting and testing, and we're taking a long time to make changes, or what sometimes we get feedback seems like a long time to make changes is because we want to give this enough room to breathe, to make sure we feel like we're not eroding the customer experience. It's why we are investing more in our frontline associates, who are the ones who are right there meeting the customer in the moment.  \n And so our priority is not just the cost side. Our priority is actually what does the experience of the future need to look like so that we meet the customer expectations, and we hold ourselves very accountable to the measurement of those experiences.  \n On the membership side -- and we talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks, what we're trying to figure out is the balance between acquisition of members but also retention of members. And what are those experiences, again, that really keep customers sticky? I mean the whole point of a great membership program is that you remain relevant to your customer base. And now -- I mean it's only been a year. And again, we have relatively low frequency with our customers. And so we're just getting data around what is it that keeps someone frequently enacting with Best Buy. And so it's changes to TotalTech but I think you heard us also mention in there, we see the opportunity potentially for another tier that might be a little bit more value-oriented, might be a little bit more convenience-oriented, but might have broader appeal.  \n And so I think what we're trying to do is, that's why we also brought my Best Buy into the conversation, we're looking across the entire gamut of what we think we can provide our customers and see the opportunity for a tiered approach all the way from free where you get free shipping, which is really resonating, all the way up to a very comprehensive membership program like TotalTech where you get everything around support. So the goal here, Mike, at the end of the day is to deliver the best possible customer experiences that are important in a new world where a customer is shopping differently. On the membership side, let me make sure I clarify the numbers. We have about 100 million My Best Buy members, of which 40 million to 45 million are active. On the TotalTech side, we currently have 5.8 million members. That's compared to 4.6 million we had last year. So those are kind of the 2 pools of membership that we're talking about. And we haven't given the percent of sales of those members, but you can imagine, it's a fairly high percent of sales between those 2 membership pools.  \n I think we see a lot of opportunity to continue to engage with those members. As you can imagine, with a My Best Buy program that large, we know a lot about those customers. And we are able to tailor to those customers. We know even more about our TotalTech members, of course. And I think we see a future where we're able to tailor more direct opportunities, sales opportunities with them. We also can see potentially that if we look at a tiered approach, there's a whole another tranche of customers who might be interested in doing more with us and having a longer relationship with us.  \n And now as we're heading during the second year of TotalTech, we're learning a lot. We think we're going to drive more engagement through a more personalized approach. We're working on our onboarding process for new members so they really understand what's available to them. And we're leveraging some of our existing vehicles so that people understand everything that we do from consultations, all the way through services, all the way through trade-in and some of the other offers. And then, of course, this speeds into some of our Best Buy Ads model, where we can tailor our advertising to specific audiences based on what we know about them. So this pool of customers is really vital to us, and I think we are continuing to improve the way we engage with them, and also drive their engagement back with us. We haven't given renewals, and we're not going to. And as you can imagine -- I mean they've been relatively in line with our expectations. You can imagine, there are some places where we see much better engagement and renewals and people who engage in things like support or who value the warranty side of TotalTech as an example, they are very, very interested in renewing. And so I think that's -- when we talk about tailoring the program for the future, we're looking for those customers who find value in some of the more unique aspects of the program and stick with the program because they see the value in that. Yes. I think you started with what makes the conversation a little bit difficult, which is the incredibly varied indicator that are out there with the consumer right now, right? Everything from historically strong job markets, spending continues specifically on services even more so than goods. Inflation might be slowing, but it still is sustainably high. \n And it's high in some of the basics like food, fuel and lodging, right? And when the basics are where that sustainable inflation is, it does mean the customer is going to make trade-off decisions. And I think we've used the same language now for probably 3 quarters. You've got an uneven and unsettled consumer who, from a confidence perspective looking forward, is still not confident about the future. And so I think what we are trying to position ourselves for is the best possible value for that consumer when they're ready in the moment. And I feel like in Q4, I think we've played that very well. \n Our pricing was very competitive. Our price perception was very competitive. And so you can see in spot as there is a better deal to be had, you can see the consumer reacting. But no matter what, it's against this overlay of a consumer who's going to make trade-off decisions based on their own budget and their own life. Yes. This is an interesting space for us because obviously, our vendor partners they want to succeed as well. And so when we think about things like promotionality, the question we got earlier around elasticity, these are great partnership discussions that we can have with our vendors as we think about how best to stimulate the market. And I said it a couple of times, but it bears repeating, our vendors are highly incented to continue to innovate on their products and to create the new products for the future. I mean obviously, no one's going to sit on their laurels and wait for the customers to come back. People are constantly trying to innovate in a way that will drive demand. And we are really the best place to highlight particularly that new innovation. And so the vendor partnerships have continued to evolve over time with that as the backdrop. \n I think we often talk about the physical experiences with our vendors, and that remains important. Our partners continue to invest in our existing stores. And I think you can see some really beautiful vendor experiences in the 35,000 square foot remodels that we're doing as well as even some of the smaller stores that we're testing, where you have just a different take on vendor experience. So there still is this real investment and interest in how a vendor shows up in a physical experience. \n But on top of that, there are so many new spaces where we're developing some different and unique partnerships. We have developed some interesting partnerships around our membership offerings. We have developed really interesting partnerships with Best Buy Ads and how they think about the access to the hundreds of millions of customers that we have that we know very well, and they can target very directly. We have deep services partnerships in many cases, we're an Apple authorized repair facility, and we're building out that services infrastructure with other partners. \n And then to your point, we're starting to see some real opportunity in supply chain and fulfillment. We have a program that's called Partner Plus. We currently have 6 partners on it. Samsung is one of those where you can actually order online at Samsung and have it fulfilled in our stores. And I think there are so many spaces, especially in an industry where like we said 40% of what we sell online is picked up in store. So there is this like intricate want and need on our customer base to physically have access to that product, and we can partner pretty uniquely with some of our vendors to help provide that experience for them. And we can see a lot of opportunity for that into our future. Well, we're not going to give the precise numbers, but directionally how you're thinking about it is essentially what we're seeing. And I just want to make sure I underscore 1 more time on the ASP side of things structurally versus calendar 2019 or fiscal 2020, you've really got 2 big things happening. And that is the mix and the category mix is quite different. Larger percent of our revenue now coming from appliances and large TVs. And also second, within our categories, the mix in the premium products has increased. And I think those 2 actually reflect some of the strengths of our model, our ability to really tailor those more premium experiences, our ability to deliver and install that large cube. I think it's -- sometimes it gets a little lost in some of the other inflation conversation. That's not what's happening here. What's happening here is, structurally, we're making what I think are some really positive changes within the business model. Yes. So what's been interesting here, and we said it in the prepared remarks, I mean our average hourly wage is up 25% versus 2019. We were one of the first to move our wages up in August of 2020 to $15 minimum almost 3 years ago. And so we've been making continuous investments in our workforce over the last 3 years. And what we're seeing, and we watch it incredibly closely, our turnover rates are really low compared to industry averages, and they're generally very similar year-over-year. And we -- I mean we've talked about it before. We might not be exactly a prepandemic, but we're still in the like mid-30% turnover range overall. And so that is exactly what we watch to make sure we're trying to strike the right balance here. \n We are continuing to invest -- and it's not just wages, it's also hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits over the last 3-year period as well. And of course, we're going to keep monitoring that on a market level basis, but we remain laser-focused on making sure that as we adjust the operating model, we are reinvesting into those employees that we have. And I think, for some of the key roles like our general managers, our turnover is in the mid-single digits, and we tapped before about some of the tenure that we see in our [ peak  ] slot agents or within some of our consultants. So we are very carefully monitoring constantly both the balance of pay and benefits and, frankly, some of the work-life balance and flexibility that our employees are demanding, and we continue to see it reflected, I would argue, in industry-leading turnover numbers. Model is always evolving, and there are always new and interesting and different ways to take cost out. I would use -- 1 of the things that we've been talking more about lately is outlets. That is a unique and differentiated customer experience. And we're pulling different customers in who are finding great values and we see a recovery rate. We've said this before, that's 2x what we would see if we were selling that sideways or selling it outside our own channel. Cost reduction is not always about expense reduction. \n It is often about finding flaws in the experience and then making opportunity kind of out of those flaws. Many of our cost reduction efforts actually have ended up and, I would argue, better employee and customer experiences. If you take some of the TV damage work that we've done over time, nobody wants to bring home a damaged TV, and there's a huge amount of cost in that for us. And so I think what we are trying to do is continuously assess our model. And then given some of the advancements we're seeing, there continues to be opportunity. We see opportunity ahead in how we run our call centers as an example. And that's a space where we've been able to pull cost out and have better customer NPS and experiences. \n So this isn't -- I think sometimes it's a zero-sum kind of game that people play in their heads with cost reduction. But I think what the team is doing is really creatively finding kind of flaws in our system. And because it's always evolving, there's always something that we're learning from and evolving. So I'm really proud of the work that the team has done, and I think we continue to have opportunity.\n And with that, yes, you bet. I'd love to thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in May. Thank you and have a great day."

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team\u2019s execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers during what is clearly a challenged environment for our industry. Customers have high expectations regarding service and we were pleased to see NPS improvements across many areas of our business as we continue to focus on creating differentiated experiences that customers will love into the future. Today, we are reporting Q3 financial results that are ahead of our expectations. Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term growth. Our comparable sales were down 10.4% on a year-over-year basis. This represents 8% revenue growth over the third quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820, which was consistent with the growth compared to fiscal \u201820 that we saw last quarter. As expected, our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year due to the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics, the investments in our growth initiatives and SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, was up 22% versus pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. We continue to manage our inventory effectively. Our inventory at the end of Q3 was down almost 15% from the third quarter of last year. This is more than our Q3 sales decline and projected Q4 sales due to a few factors. First, from a timing perspective, some receipts came in a few days later than expected and arrived just after the quarter closed. Additionally, due to supply constraints last year, we focused on bringing inventory in earlier to secure it for holiday. So October of last year ended with an unusually high level of inventory. For additional context, this year\u2019s $600 million in receipts moved from October into the first two weeks of November. This shift equates to about 8% of our inventory. The promotional environment continues to be considerably more intense than last year. Like Q2, the level of promotionality in Q3 was similar to pre-pandemic levels and in some areas was even more promotional as the industry works through excess inventory in the channel as well as response to softer customer demand. From a merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories. Consistent with the first half of the year, the largest impacts to our enterprise comparable sales came from computing and home theater. Compared to Q3 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue remains 23% higher and our appliances revenue remains 37% higher. Our blended average selling price, or ASP, in Q3 was down slightly on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as promotional activity that was largely absent during much of the pandemic has returned. Compared to fiscal \u201820, ASPs continue to be higher and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. This is due to two factors that have been driving ASPs higher for years and accelerated during the pandemic. First, category mix. We have driven material growth and mixed more into products like large appliances and large TVs, which carry high ASPs. Second, within categories, customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. I would like to pause here for a moment and talk about what we are seeing as it relates to consumer behavior. As I step back at the highest macro level across retail, each customer is making trade-offs, especially with the significant impact of inflation on the basics like food, fuel and lodging. This disproportionately impacts lower income consumers as a much larger proportion of their spend is on those basics. Across consumers, we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up and value clearly matters to everyone. During Q3, we continue to see more interest in sales events geared at exceptional value. As a result, there is no one way to describe all customers and we have repeatedly referred to the impacts of the current macro environment on consumers as uneven and unsettled. As it relates to our results as a specialty CE retailer, we saw relatively consistent behavior from our purchasing customers in Q3. Our demographic mix is basically steady versus last year and pre-pandemic. Our blended mix of premium product is higher, both units and dollars than last year and pre-pandemic. Within some specific categories, we can see some cohorts of customers trading down, but it is not aggregating into an overall impact. While sales are down in our signature categories as we lap the strong growth of the pandemic years, our initiative to expand our presence in adjacent categories is driving sales growth. While still small overall, we are driving sales growth in e-bikes and outdoor living categories as we expand to more stores in addition to our online assortment. Outdoor furniture, in particular, is demonstrating strong growth driven by new showrooms for our Yardbird assortment, including in our Best Buy stores and new standalone showrooms. From a health and wellness perspective, we launched over-the-counter hearing aids last month in almost 300 stores and online, including a new online hearing assessment tool. Volume is still relatively low, but the Q3 sales growth rate exceeded our expectations and demonstrates that customers see Best Buy as a relevant provider of these products. As you have all likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun and now more than ever, our customers are looking to bring joy back into their holiday celebration. Like we said in our last earnings call, we expect shopping patterns will look more similar to historical holiday periods than what we have seen in the last 2 years. Specifically, we expect there will be more customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday, and the two weeks leading up to December 25. Our results so far in October and the first 2 weeks of November have come in largely as expected and support this view thus far. From an inventory perspective, we have approached holiday strategically, placing bets in areas that require a longer lead time and taking a more flexible approach in other areas. We believe this gives us more room to invest and partner with vendors to changes in demand to provide additional sales opportunities. I would also stress that while November typically represents the largest influx of inventory in Q4, we will continue to receive inventory every week throughout the holiday season to replenish inventory levels. While aligning inventory levels with uncertain and evolving customer demand is always challenging, we are well positioned and feel confident we will be able to react quickly to changes we may see in customer demand. From a labor standpoint, we have seen a strong pool of applicants for seasonal associates to supplement our store team. This combined with our investments in wages over the past few years and comparably low turnover that remains close to pre-pandemic levels means we are ready to provide our customers the great service they expect to find in our stores. We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all our customers, including special promotions available to Totaltech and MyBestBuy members. We have curated gift list with inspiration for all from family members to foodies and content creators to gamers. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we have extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. We are also offering free next day delivery on thousands of items in addition to our convenience store and curbside pickup options. We feel confident heading into what could be an uneven holiday season and we have tailored our offerings to delight our customers whatever their budget. Strategically, as we look ahead, we are positioning ourselves to lead the way in the future of retailing. This is a future where the customer is in control and expect seamless experiences across all touch points. It is becoming more evident every quarter that the pandemic-induced shopping behavior changes are sticky and that our digital penetration of domestic sales will likely remain above 30%. For the first 9 months of the year, our online sales as a percentage of domestic revenue were 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. We expect that penetration rate to begin to increase again over time as it did pre-pandemic. Additionally, customer demand for other virtual interactions has remained elevated and we have seen strong and sustained sales growth from our investments in chat, phone and video sales experiences this year.  Of course, that also means that almost 70% of customers are shopping in our stores and customers representing 42% of our online sales pickup their products at our stores. As such, it is imperative we continue to invest in our stores and elevate our unique experiences. One way we are doing that is with our 35,000 square foot experience store remodel. We remain excited about these as we continue to see positive results from our longer running Houston and Charlotte remodels, including stronger sales, increased customer penetration and higher net promoter scores. These stores highlight broader assortment, including the opportunity to showcase the new categories I referenced earlier and really bring them to life. The remodels also include premium home theater and premium appliances, more space for consultations and services and expanded fulfillment capabilities like larger warehouses, in-store and curbside pickup and 24/7 lockers. Additionally, as you would expect, they all include the very best, most up-to-date vendor experiences showcasing premium merchandising and specialized labor. While market conditions have created a tough environment for delivering remodels, our incredible and dedicated team was able to deliver 42 of them by Black Friday. We plan to provide a broader update on our store portfolio refresh strategy at year end. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost effective ways. For example, we have introduced a new app for our associates called Solution SideKick that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and location. With the app, associates interacting with the customer can see the customers\u2019 profile in the moment, including historical purchases and active memberships. As the associate starts an order with product recommendations, the app automatically calculates total tax savings for existing and prospective members and recommends additional product solutions. Importantly, if a customer isn\u2019t ready to buy in the moment, associates can send the product recommendations and a recap of the conversation to the customer via e-mail, text or QR code so they can purchase later at their convenience. It is early, but we are very encouraged by the ramping employee adoption of the app and the higher revenue per transaction we are seeing when associates leverage Solution Sidekick. We are also leveraging our investment in electronic sign labels to provide a better and more efficient experience for customers who want to buy a product that is locked up or not readily available on the shelf. We have added new functionality that allows the customer to scan the QR code with their phone\u2019s camera and push a button notifying they are ready to purchase. This sends the store associate an instant and prioritized notification to pick the product and have it ready at pickup. We also took a much more digital approach when building out the experience for our 5,000 square foot store pilot we opened in Charlotte over the summer, highly leveraging these digital tools. Similar to the U.S., we are evolving our model in Canada as well and continue to see better-than-expected financial results there. We have been piloting initiatives there, including technology subscription, online marketplace, a market-focused test and small store formats. This expands our testing and innovation capabilities and provides opportunities to learn from their experiences when they are able to iterate faster and are further along in their pilots. We are excited to be able to innovate and leverage learnings on both sides of the border. Turning to membership, our Best Buy Totaltech offering is a very important initiative to drive deeper relationships with our customers. Last month, we passed the 1 year anniversary of our national launch and we are pleased to report that Totaltech is driving the member behavior we envision. Members are engaging more frequently with us and shifting their share of wallet to Best Buy. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our net promoter score from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than non-members. Nearly half of the new members joining the program in the past year were either new or lapsed customers reinforcing that the value of Totaltech resonates beyond our existing loyal customers. Very early retention data shows renewal rates running largely in line with our original expectations. Totaltech is a comprehensive membership with wide appeal across demographics. For example, younger generations and those with children utilize more of our newer warranty and member pricing benefits and older generations utilize more of our enhanced services and support benefit. Our associates continue to love the program since it clearly provides value to every single customer and simplifies the sales interaction. While we are encouraged by the results in the first full year, we will continue to iterate based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. As we said last quarter, we have been encouraged with the pace at which we have been acquiring new customers, considering the uniqueness of the offer, the macro environment and the decline in our product sales. Nevertheless, these factors have resulted in a lower member count than our original expectations. Last quarter, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members. And the early results continue to be positive. We are also activating on ways to continue to improve acquisition through our digital channel. From an optimization perspective, we will evolve the program in ways that also reduce our cost to serve. We have now lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact and anticipate the program to have a neutral impact on Q4 from a year-over-year perspective. Over time, we expect the program to contribute to operating income rate expansion as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In the current economic environment, many consumers are facing increasing financial constraints. We believe we are well positioned to meet customers\u2019 needs in this environment. In addition to creating key promotional moments, offering competitive prices, repairing and supporting existing products and scaling our Best Buy outlets, we offer multiple financing options to improve affordability. These include our co-branded Citibank credit card, lease-to-own program, buy now pay later options and most recently, our exclusive upgrades plus program for Apple Mac books. Upgrade+ powered by Citizens Pay is a brand-new program that allows customers to acquire MAC laptops and related accessories for a low monthly fee. After 3 years, they can easily turn in their old laptop and upgrade to the latest tech while they continue paying a low monthly fee. We can then refurbish this old laptop and offer it to a new customer through our outlet stores or digital platforms. This partnership with Apple is a great example of how we work with our vendors in unique ways to commercialize and showcase their technology innovation while also offering unique value and confidence to our customers. In a different example of a unique vendor partnership, we have started a pilot in the homebuilder space through a collaboration with Whirlpool and one of the top homebuilders in the U.S. to provide and install everything from connected doorbells and thermostats to large appliances. Though early, we have delivered 5 roughly 45 markets for the homebuilder, which is giving us great insight for how we maybe able to expand the pilot. Based on what we have learned, we see this model as an opportunity to partner with numerous other homebuilders to provide them similar or expanded solutions based on our capability. Before closing and turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and the communities we serve. The Best Buy Foundation\u2019s team tech centers are providing access, inspiration and opportunity for young people in the communities that need it most. We continue to expand the program with 52 team tech centers open across the country, including opening our 19 team tech center in the Twin Cities, our hometown. We also remain committed to creating an environment where all employees feel engaged and have access to specialized benefits and resources. We are proud to have women leaders at the highest levels of our company and believe it reflects our commitment to support our employees and their. This year, we are honored to rank #15 on Forbes 2022 list of the world\u2019s top female-friendly company, which recognizes companies that support women professionally and personally. Similarly, we were honored to be named as one of Forbes 2022 America\u2019s Best Employers for Veterans, our first time on that list. In summary, I am proud of our nimble execution this quarter and this year. Our teams have been navigating well through an incredibly dynamic environment and I want to thank them for their ingenuity, drive and commitment to our customers. There is, of course, ongoing macro uncertainty. And as we head through the holiday and into next year, we believe it will continue to be an uneven backdrop. Indicators remain unusually varied. The job market remains strong, consumer spending continues, and inflation appears to be slowing a bit, but savings are starting to erode. Consumer confidence is low. The housing market is cooling and inflation remains a particular concern on the basics like food, fuel and lodging, all of which have a profound and sustained impact. As you would expect, we are planning for multiple scenarios given the very unsettled and uneven consumer response to these varied indicators. We are adjusting our cost structure as we respond to current and potential future conditions. We are also making strategic decisions and trade-offs to continue to advance our initiatives. We are doubling down on our ability to lead the future of omnichannel retailer and capitalize on opportunities as the industry moves through this downturn and eventually returns to growth again. We are as confident and excited about our future as ever. Technology demand over the past few years has resulted in a larger installed base, and customers will want and need to replace and upgrade their tech devices, particularly as we near the 3-year mark since the start of the pandemic. At the same time, our technology vendor partners will continue to innovate and drive excitement and demand. We are the leading technology solutions provider for the home, a home increasingly dependent on all this technology working together and evolving over time. We are uniquely positioned to inspire and help customers with all aspects of their technology from deciding what to purchase, to installing it and getting the most out of it, all the way to helping when it\u2019s not working. We leverage our specialized Geek Squad agents, our expert sales associates and consultants, experienced merchants and sophisticated supply chain to deliver experiences no one else can in customers\u2019 homes, virtually, digitally and in our stores. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you\u2019re able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Before I get into the details specific to our third quarter, I would like to step back and provide some context on how our financials have evolved since the start of the pandemic. As you are all aware, the past couple of years have come with varying levels of financial performance related to the pandemic impacts. There have been quarters where our stores were closed when promotions were nearly nonexistent, in quarters with higher and lower incentive compensation, just to name a few. We also saw record levels of demand as people were spending more time in their homes and receiving government stimulus benefits. And now we are living through the pressures as we lap those periods. However, what has remained consistent over the past few years is the increased penetration of digital sales, which, as Corie mentioned, has nearly doubled since the start of the pandemic. As a result, over the past couple of years, we have modified our store operating model, highlighted new store formats and rolled out a new membership offering. To better understand the financial impacts of all this change, I want to briefly give context on the decline in this year\u2019s non-GAAP operating rate outlook compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820 full year rate of 4.9%. First, our core domestic non-GAAP operating income rate has slightly improved as we have made structural changes in support of our increased digital sales mix, the reductions we have made in store payroll expenses largely offset increased parcel and inflationary supply chain costs as well as our increased technology investments that are designed to support a more digital shopping experience. Over the same time horizon, our core product margin rates have remained relatively unchanged. In addition, we have also improved the profitability of our International segment, which included the exit of our operations in Mexico. Second, the investments we\u2019ve made in Totaltech Best Buy Health and our retail store remodels represents approximately 130 basis points of non-GAAP operating income rate contraction. As we have shared in the past, these initiatives come with near-term pressure, but we expect they will improve our profitability in the future. Third, this year\u2019s financial performance has benefited from lower incentive compensation when compared to fiscal \u201820. As we reset performance targets at the start of next year, this is not a structural benefit. This highlights how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Let me now transition to third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 10.4% on a comparable basis and our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.9% compared to 5.8% last year. A gross profit rate decline of approximately 150 basis points was the primary driver of the lower operating income rate. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $188 million lower than last year, but were 40 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38 compared to $2.08 last year. A lower share count resulted in a $0.13 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. While our results were down to last year, our performance was ahead of our expectations we shared in our last earnings call. From a profitability standpoint, better-than-expected results were largely driven by disciplined expense management that resulted in favorable SG&A expense, both from a dollar and rate perspective. The favorable SG&A was partially offset by slightly lower gross profit rate which was primarily the result of more promotional environment than we expected. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year before providing insights into how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 10.8% to $9.8 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 10.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, October\u2019s year-over-year comparable sales decline of 15% was the largest decline while September was our best-performing month. Conversely, when comparing to the pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820 comparable period, October had the most growth, while holiday shopping was more prevalent this October compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820, it was lower than last year, when there was more of an urgency for consumers to get products early due to supply chain fears. In our International segment, revenue decreased 14.9% of $787 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.3% in Canada and a negative impact of 408 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Turning now to gross profit. our enterprise rate declined 150 basis points to 22%. Our domestic gross profit rate also declined 150 basis points, with the primary drivers consistent with expectations as well as the past two quarters. These drivers include: one, lower product margins, which were primarily due to increased promotions; two, lower services margins rates, including pressure from Totaltech; and three, the impact of higher supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company\u2019s credit card arrangement. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. As Corie shared, we fully lapped last year\u2019s national rollout in October. As a result, the approximately 60 basis points headwind to last year from lower services margin rates was a sequential improvement from the past two quarters. Moving next to SG&A, as I stated earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $188 million while increasing 40 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the domestic segment, the primary drivers were lower incentive compensation and reduced store payroll costs. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $100 million this quarter and $365 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense, which excludes the impact from incentive compensation, was favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales. International SG&A was $150 million, decreased $21 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The decrease was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 23.8% versus 25% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% versus our previous guidance of approximately 23%. The lower outlook for the full year is primarily due to discrete tax matters in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $595 million and share repurchases of $455 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter and recently resumed repurchasing shares in early November. We now expect to spend a total of approximately $1 billion in share repurchases this fiscal year. We are committed to being a premium dividend payer based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal \u201823, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of non-GAAP net income. We view the target as a long-term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should fall outside the range in any 1 year. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. As we shared last quarter, the makeup of our capital expenditures looks a little different than last year with store-related investments representing a larger portion of our overall spending. Technology and digital capital are planned similar in terms of dollars versus last year, but its mix of overall capital spending is closer to 55% versus 75% last year. Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in our business, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $26 million of such restructuring costs in the third quarter and $61 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. We currently expect to incur additional charges to the fourth quarter for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter, starting with our top line expectations. We are planning for comparable sales to decline approximately 10% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. The improved outlook for the full year is entirely driven by our third quarter results as our expectations remain unchanged for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that the current macro environment trends will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Although the year-over-year sales decline in Q4 is expected to be similar to sales decline we just reported for Q3. Our outlook implies a larger deceleration versus the pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. As expected, the year-over-year sales decline for the first 3 weeks of November is similar to the decline we saw in October. Moving next to profitability. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income rate to be slightly higher than our previous guidance of approximately 4%. Similar to our top line expectations, this improvement is driven by our third quarter performance. Relative to our previous expectations, we now expect SG&A to be a little more favorable, whereas we are factoring in a little more gross profit rate pressure due to increased promotional activity. For the fourth quarter specifically, but we still expect a majority of the year-over-year operating income rate decline to be driven by lower gross profit rate. There is less pressure than prior quarters as we lap Totaltech and some of the supply chain inflationary impacts. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Zach Fadem at Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSam Reid: Awesome. Thanks so much. This is Sam Reid pitch hitting for Zach here. You guys gave a lot of good color around the Q4 outlook. But I guess I wanted to just unpack things a bit more there because Q3 really did come in nicely, ahead of plan, yet you\u2019re keeping things through the balance of the year unchanged. Could you just give us a bit more detail there around your thinking? And can we interpret some of this as conservatism on your part? Or is there a possibility that there might be some differences in sequencing around holiday sales this year versus last year that might be driving your decision to kind of keep Q4 unchanged? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I\u2019ll start here. This is Matt. I think when you look at the Q4, similar to the whole year, it\u2019s been a bit difficult to properly reflect forecast in this environment. I think we\u2019re trying to plan appropriately with everything that we see, Q4 comp sales are expected to decline about 10%. This is a deceleration from FY \u201820 growth perspective as you think about the quarters as they progress this year. The holiday, we do expect to look a little different than last year. So probably more around the sales events, so less early shopping as we saw last year, but a more early shopping than we saw in fiscal \u201820. So from what we can see as we exited Q3 with October sales down around 15%. We\u2019re seeing November\u2019s sales start around that same amount. So we\u2019re at this point in line with our expectations. Holiday is obviously quite different than it has been over the prior quarters. So I think we\u2019re appropriately planned for where we see the consumer in front of us.\nSam Reid: Awesome. Thanks so much. I will pass it along.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Pete Keith at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPete Keith: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nice results. Just sticking on the Q4 theme, we know the macro stuff, but let\u2019s just talk about products. What are some of the product categories looking at this holiday season, as you guys are most excited about and putting in front of your customers?\nCorie Barry: Yes, I think I\u2019d start with a holiday where \u2013 and I said it in the script but I mean it. I think people are really just looking for some joy in their holiday and what feels like a little bit more normal, I say that an [\u201choliday\u201d] (ph) versus the last couple of years, Peter. So I think what we see as exciting are those things families can do together. So things like televisions. And that\u2019s, again, not just the TV that\u2019s about streaming so much more content than people were before. Things like VR that take you to new places and allow you new experiences and are increasingly having more and more content availability, Gaming continues to be exciting for people. And that is a place where we\u2019re getting as much as we humanly can, but there still is some constraint, and we all know that drives a little bit of excitement. Health and wearables people really taking charge of their own health. We continue to see people very interested in taking control of health and fitness and their own abilities there and then still computing and tablets and this kind of productivity question. I mentioned it in the script. This is after almost 3 years now at the pandemic. You\u2019ve got a cohort of people now who are looking for that latest and greatest in that ability to upgrade, stay on the go, keep their life in the kind of hybrid way that everyone is living. So the cool part \u2013 an then there is all the like fun little stuff that we sell that I think people forget, the great gifts that are in things like small appliances and indoor garden, a connected coffee cup that keeps your coffee warm. There is just this incredible array of really interesting products that technology continues to push the envelope on and evolve. And I think what we love most is these are gifts that change every single year. So for the great gift giver, I think we have a lot to offer.\nPete Keith: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just taking a little bit of a longer-term question around Totaltech, so you gave a lot of good information now that you\u2019ve anniversaried the rollout. When we just think about that EBIT margin accretion, is that something that we should now start to see going forward in the next 12 months or if you are running a little bit lower on memberships than you thought, is it maybe 1 year out before it starts to become margin accretive?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I think consistent with our \u2013 what we talked about at the March Investor Day, I think we expect [the backbone] (ph) for our initiatives to help improve our rate as we look towards FY \u201825. So obviously, the world is much different than it was back then, and the program has continued to evolve, and we will continue to iterate. But I think we would expect the Totaltech to help provide a bit of rate improvement year-over-year as we look into next year, but probably more so even as we look into FY \u201825. Clearly, there is \u2013 we\u2019re learning a lot around the program and looking to make tweaks to the offer as we progress this next year from all the learnings we\u2019re having. So it would be our expectation that over time, it would help improve our rate from a pressure year-over-year.\nCorie Barry: And Peter, I just want to make sure I reemphasize something that I said in the script here, which is the good news is it is doing what we want it to do. This is a program that\u2019s geared at those stickier, longer-term relationships with customers, being high consideration for customers and, therefore, driving up that frequency and that greater share of wallet. So I think those early indicators for us are very positive.\nPete Keith: Okay, sounds good. Thanks so much and good luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli at Truist. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So the additional deceleration you\u2019ve seen in October and so far in November, is that driven primarily from transactions? Or is that more ASP pressures from the heightened promotional environment? And then related to that, any feel for whether those declines are kind of across the board? Or is it more concentrated in specific customer cohorts? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. Consistent with what we\u2019ve seen this year, most of that contraction is coming from transactions. ASPs have been a bit down, as we mentioned, and we expect them to probably come down a little bit in Q4. It\u2019s more of the transactions that are causing that top line deceleration on a year-over-year basis. But importantly, too, what we said is if you think about where we sit against FY \u201820 and Q3 and as we start our growth for this holiday season will likely come a little different than it did last year and more of those sale events driving more sales later into Q4 out of Q3. So for most of that organic is coming from transactions versus ASPs.\nCorie Barry: To your question about customer cohort, we don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it varies a little bit week to week to week. But in general, what we\u2019ve been seeing is a pretty consistent customer mix both versus last year and versus pre-pandemic. And when I say customer mix, I mean kind of demographically, we actually are seeing a pretty consistent mix of customers. Like I said, it can vary a little bit week-to-week depending on sales profiles and the values we are offering. But at the highest level, we are actually seeing pretty consistent behavior amongst our customer cohorts.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now move on to our next question from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thanks and good morning. You mentioned some comments on 2023. Can you take us through the building blocks of margins next year? Is the basic math that we add back all the incentive comp savings this year and saying hypothetically low-single digit positive comp environment, it just becomes a leverage story, or are there still structural SG&A savings and any comments on gross margin as well?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. There\u2019s probably a number of scenarios we are planning for next year, and we aren\u2019t going to provide guidance. But we try to lay out some puts and takes around what\u2019s happening in business now to provide some context. We just talked about it here. The largest drivers of our decline year-over-year versus pre-pandemic have been those investments we are making. And as we talked about, Totaltech, it also applies to health that we would expect some of those \u2013 some of the contraction to kind of abate a bit as we get into next year. But importantly, even as you look into FY \u201824. So, we would expect some of those initiatives, the pressure coming from would lessen a little bit as we get into next year, but more so even later into FY \u201825.  I think from a short-term incentive perspective, you are right, we will reset our performance tables next year, and we will likely have to add back anywhere from $200 million to $250 million of SDI expense when we reset those tables and start next year\u2019s plan. So, that will obviously be a pressure we are managing through. At this point, we don\u2019t necessarily see a lot of change to the product margin rates from next \u2013 from this year into next year. But obviously, we are early in our planning process. And lastly, you are right, most importantly, where our OI rate might \u2013 is going to be impacted by the level of sales that happened and we are still in the middle of trying to understand what type of sales environment will happen next year, but it is a large impact to how we plan what the overall rate will be.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then in terms of the promotional environment, you mentioned certain categories being more promotional than expected. Is that home theater, and computing or another category? And then as you think about what you are seeing in the market right now, some of the big retailers, other retailers have started their Black Friday promotions or any most have already. So, how are you seeing sort of the inventory in the market and what categories in particular, are you elevating your promotional expectations in the fourth quarter?\nCorie Barry: I think the Black Friday promotions started the day after Halloween. And for everyone, there is definitely a lot out there. I think if you rewind the clock for a second here, I actually was rummaging back through last year, and we actually said last year heading into Q4, we expected CE to be more promotional. And coming out of it, we said there were actually some categories last year that were as promotional as pre-pandemic. And as we headed into this year that we are in now, we said we expected the environment to get back to those pre-pandemic levels. I think it happened a little earlier than we thought. But in general, this is kind of how we expected that the year would play that by now we would be back to those pre-pandemic levels. And obviously, with some of the demand softening and customers targeting value, I think that\u2019s happening at even a more exacerbated rate. I think \u2013 and so there is that. We are even seeing some of this promotional intensity in the secondary channels as well because it\u2019s been well reported, there is a great deal of inventory out there in the channel. So, it\u2019s broad-based promotionality, which is a little bit different than a historical holiday where we really, really targeted against some of the certain product drive times. To your specific question about what areas we are seeing it in, we are seeing it across the board, honestly, but really mainly seeing it in some of the iconic traffic driving products, think about like headphones and wearables. And then you can imagine anywhere where the supply is really ample, we are also seeing some of that promotional activity in those spaces. And I think back to the question on like the Q4 guide and how we are thinking about it, I think that\u2019s part of what we see in the background and part of what we are trying to take into account as we look at a competitive environment going forward.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thanks so much for the great holiday.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Liz Suzuki at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nLiz Suzuki: Thank you. Just on your last comment kind of talking about how some of the retailers have had this excess inventory. You have been fairly nimble in managing your inventory level as well. A lot of your peers kind of caught off product that this changes demand landscape. So, I guess just given that this quarter sales came in a little better than what you expected, and I know there is some timing in terms of when holiday is really expected to kind of peak. But \u2013 and do you expect to restock in particular categories? And what are you looking to have more of at this point?\nCorie Barry: Yes. First, I just want to say, I give our teams a great deal of credit for navigating to your point, what has been an incredibly volatile backdrop. I think the expense and analytics of our teams really shines in moments like this. So, we talked a bit in the prepared comments about \u2013 some of this is just a shift in timing. Last year, recall, inventory levels were really challenged. And so everyone was trying to bring in inventory really early, and there was lots of customer demand really early because people were worried about not being able to get the products throughout the holiday. This year as we said, we expected the holiday to shape a little bit more traditionally like pre-pandemic, and therefore, our inventory flows are moving more in that direction. And we specifically said in places where we have longer lead time categories, we placed some of those bets earlier and then allowed ourselves a little bit more ability to maneuver on those items that don\u2019t take quite as much long lead time. There are always some spotty places where we wish we had more inventory. This is almost always true in consumer electronics. I mentioned gaming consoles, that\u2019s commonly a place. And I think there has been some conversation about some of the more iconic phones and the production there and availability there. So, that\u2019s not anything that\u2019s new that\u2019s kind of typical as we head into holiday. But those will really be some of the spaces where we would add more. And what I like is that we have a lot of room to maneuver throughout the holiday in partnership with our vendors. As we think about where the demand profiles might ebb and flow, we can bring that inventory in, and we said it. We bring in the majority in November, but we replenish the whole holiday season, and this allows us the room to bring in really what\u2019s resonating with customers.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. And just on your comment earlier about online penetration being likely to grow as it did prior to the pandemic, are you agnostic to online versus in-person shopping or is online an inherently lower operating margin business than brick-and-mortar?\nCorie Barry: I will start a bit and then Matt can add in. What I actually believe that this combination of omnichannel is our strength. And not only are we agnostic, we love it when customers are using the multitude of channels that we have and that includes consultations at home that includes our virtual channels like chat and phone that includes online and that includes stores. And so I \u2013 instead of just even saying agnostic, I actually would say we want to double down on a customer, who wants to shop us across all those channels. Matt, maybe you can provide some of the profitability color.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I think over the last number of years, the team has done an amazing job adjusting for a very different way of delivering to the customers. In my prepared remarks, we talked about how the core of our rate is actually slightly up compared to where it was pre-pandemic. And that\u2019s adjusting for \u2013 nearly doubling of the online mix in addition to absorbing all of the inflationary costs that we have seen over the last couple of years. So, that gives a little evidence to financially, we are able to actually do quite well in an environment where our dot-com business can reach those levels of penetration. So, we are absolutely agnostic \u2013 and on top of it, we just want to do what\u2019s right for the customer. The customers are going to lead us to where we need to be and our model can absorb that in any type of environment.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning Corie and Matt. I wanted to focus on computing and home theater trends during the third quarter. I think you called out in the release, the weakness in those categories on a year-over-year basis, but it looks for the category detail in the press release that the trends improved on a 3-year basis. So, curious if you could just expand on what drove that reacceleration? And then as my follow-up question, is this reacceleration part of the reason to restart the share repurchase program, or any color on what gives you the confidence to do so?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Yes, computing, I will start with that. I think it was actually a large driver of a sales decline in Q3. But compared to FY \u201820, it was up 23%. So, we are still seeing very strong growth from the pre-pandemic period. We have seen a very large growth in the installed base over the past couple of years. Clearly, it\u2019s now being impacted by the level of the normalization, if you go from the spend. We are actually seeing a good start to Apple Plus program. We are actually seeing some customers mix towards some of the latest products versus opening price points. So, it\u2019s still relatively small and new, but that\u2019s a good start. Gaming continues to be a strong growth area compared to pre-pandemic in the computing space. So, so much of the gaming world is now kind of blending between gaming consoles and the computing arena and innovation continues on, and we expect that to continue. So, still down year-over-year, but still good strength and a great opportunity ahead of us. TVs, as you expect home theater did have negative comps as well. TVs or promotions are up on a year-over-year basis significantly. A lot more stronger inventory positions from our customers. And so we are still very confident about TVs going forward. Holiday is always a great environment for TV. ASP is down a little bit year-over-year. But again, we are seeing good mix into higher television sizes and premium products over the last couple of years. So, really encouraged by what the business could offer. I think to the confidence of the share repurchase question, I think we \u2013 I think appropriately just took some time to understand the environment ahead of us on last year\u2019s \u2013 in last quarter, just to make sure we were appropriately planning for the holiday period, giving our self enough space on inventory investment and where we need to sit from a working capital perspective and feel confident about our position in Q4 and where our inventory sits. And it is an establishment of confidence on where we sit financially and as we head into next year or so.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: You bet.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now move on to our next question from Seth Basham at Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is on Totaltech. You mentioned that members are tracking a little bit lower than your expectations. You have been able to parse that out between the slower sales and demand environment versus attributes of the program?\nCorie Barry: Not right now, we are not going to kind of give the exact numbers and some of the science behind it. I think it\u2019s fair to say as we head into next year, we will probably give a little bit more color on what we are seeing there. And as you can imagine, it\u2019s very hard to parse out the two pieces there. I think what we are remaining focused on is striking the balance between what really resonates with our customers and accomplishes what we want in terms of share of wallet and frequency. And the cost of the program and ensuring that when we are investing in the program, it makes sense, and it\u2019s in those pieces that really resonate over the long-term, again, with our customers. And I think \u2013 I am not trying to skirt the question. It is going to take us a little bit of time to parse those things because the frequency that we have with our customers is a little bit different than some other retailers. And so as we are assessing just whether or not this program is doing what we want and to your specific question, why people are choosing to or not to enroll, it\u2019s going to take us a little bit of time to pull those pieces apart.\nSeth Basham: Got it. Thank you. Fair enough. And my follow-up question is on your store model and refresh program. I think you said you have 42 stores done now. What\u2019s your plan over the next year? And any more color you can provide in terms of the average sales or margin dollars lift from those stores that have been remodeled relative to the core?\nCorie Barry: Yes. We haven\u2019t really given the quantity of stores yet that we want to do into next year. And we actually mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are planning to give an update as we head into next year on our kind of experience refresh plan. I think it\u2019s important to note that everything that we are doing, we are trying to root in this really incredibly elevated shopping experience with this broader assortment, expanded fulfillment, best vendor experiences. And while we haven\u2019t given specific numbers, we have said we continue to see really good and improved sales results out of at least the two that have been opened more than 2 years now. And NPS results consistently in those as well. So, we continue to remain bullish on them now. We just opened a bunch of that 42 here recently. So, we are going to read on how they are performing out of the gate. But like I said, we will give you more of an update on our future plans as we head into next year.\nSeth Basham: Thank you and happy holidays.\nCorie Barry: You too. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrad Thomas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask another just about the state of the consumer. Obviously, nice to see the sequential improvement in trends which I think is somewhat a function of the comparisons from stimulus and the pandemic getting behind us. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in terms of mix and trade up and trade down and comments on perhaps the trends in the appliance category where we have seen a little bit of slowdown. Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Yes, absolutely. If I take a really large step back, I think Matt did a nice job in his prepared remarks saying quarter-to-quarter, it is really difficult to sort through all the laps to what you said on stimulus, on stores open, stores close, promotionality, all of those things. And so instead, I think at the sequentials all get difficult. At the end of the day, we are trying to take the biggest step back and look at a consumer that we know is really facing trade-off decisions. Obviously, especially when you have inflation on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging, and we know this definitely impacts lower income consumers to a greater extent. I mean almost 70% of spend in the lowest income earners are on those kind of basics versus more like 55% for the higher income earners. So, you have got a large proportion of your spend going there. And so we know that people are looking for value across all of those cohorts, and there is no easy one way to describe the consumer. It\u2019s very uneven depending on how you came out of the pandemic, and it\u2019s very unsettled. You can see that even just in some of the confidence numbers while people are trying to sort their way. I think as it relates to us specifically, and again, specialty CE retailer, we are actually seeing relatively consistent behavior, and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks. Our demographic mix is essentially steady versus both last year and pre-pandemic. If anything, it\u2019s moved just a touch more into the lower income brackets. And our blended mix of premium product is higher, both in units and dollars than both last year and pre-pandemic. And we did that on a very specific like price point, SKU kind of level to look at where people were really opting into those more premium. Now, obviously, within some specific categories, we are seeing some cohorts of customers trading down, but it\u2019s not aggregating at this point into an overall impact that we are seeing consistently across every single category. So, it can depend like you might see different behaviors in back-to-school than you might see as we are heading into holiday here. But at the highest level, we are actually seeing the consumer behaves relatively similarly as we did even pre-pandemic, I think more so, it\u2019s the overarching decisions about how they are going to make those trade-off decisions between things like services and restaurants and vacations and goods and those base needs that they have.\nBrad Thomas: Great. Thanks so much Corie.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will now take our last question from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead \nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me again here. So, the question I have, just with respect to holiday promotions. Yes, and you recognize I know Best Buy want to keep this plans close to the vest. But as you think about this holiday and maybe what you are seeing already just given the cross currents from spending out there and some of the inventory positions, is Best Buy looking to take more leading promotions or you prepared more to react, what others do in the market? And to what extent are you working closely with your our supplier partners to both stimulate demand, but also start to alleviate some of these excess inventories in the channel?\nCorie Barry: I would almost go back to how we talked about holiday pre-pandemic. And holiday is always a very different time of the year. This is about really making targeted decisions about when, how and where any retailer wants to be promotional. And we have, I would argue, a good long history of deciding where and how within the holiday, we want to be promotional. That doesn\u2019t mean you go toe-to-toe on exactly the same items, exactly the same days with every other retailer. It means you create a pretty foundational holiday plan and then you stick to that pivoting as you see where the customer might have more interest. To your point, that means you are partnering with vendors way upstream prior to holiday to really think through what we think is both going to resonate with the customer but also hit those promotional price points that make sense. Obviously, we are committed to being competitive on price and our own data would actually say we have improved our price competitiveness, both compared to last year and compared to pre-pandemic. So, not only are we baseline, I think more competitive, we are then obviously picking those targeted. And I talked about it a lot in the prepared remarks, places where we can offer value. And for us, that\u2019s across the spectrum of price points, especially when we are still seeing consumers bear towards those more premium products, we are really going to try to offer any budget, that sense of value and we are going to, in a targeted way, decide where and how we want to play throughout the holiday. And I think that is really the foundation of how Matt and the team have tried to forecast what we expect in Q4. And with that, I think that\u2019s our last question. I want to thank you all so much for \u2013 thank you, Brad. I want to thank you all so much for joining us today. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in February. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. Stay safe. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you're able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Before I get into the details specific to our third quarter, I would like to step back and provide some context on how our financials have evolved since the start of the pandemic. As you are all aware, the past couple of years have come with varying levels of financial performance related to the pandemic impacts. There have been quarters where our stores were closed when promotions were nearly nonexistent, in quarters with higher and lower incentive compensation, just to name a few. We also saw record levels of demand as people were spending more time in their homes and receiving government stimulus benefits. And now we are living through the pressures as we lap those periods. However, what has remained consistent over the past few years is the increased penetration of digital sales, which, as Corie mentioned, has nearly doubled since the start of the pandemic. As a result, over the past couple of years, we have modified our store operating model, highlighted new store formats and rolled out a new membership offering. To better understand the financial impacts of all this change, I want to briefly give context on the decline in this year's non-GAAP operating rate outlook compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820 full year rate of 4.9%. First, our core domestic non-GAAP operating income rate has slightly improved as we have made structural changes in support of our increased digital sales mix, the reductions we have made in store payroll expenses largely offset increased parcel and inflationary supply chain costs as well as our increased technology investments that are designed to support a more digital shopping experience. Over the same time horizon, our core product margin rates have remained relatively unchanged. In addition, we have also improved the profitability of our International segment, which included the exit of our operations in Mexico. Second, the investments we've made in Totaltech Best Buy Health and our retail store remodels represents approximately 130 basis points of non-GAAP operating income rate contraction. As we have shared in the past, these initiatives come with near-term pressure, but we expect they will improve our profitability in the future. Third, this year's financial performance has benefited from lower incentive compensation when compared to fiscal \u201820. As we reset performance targets at the start of next year, this is not a structural benefit. This highlights how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Let me now transition to third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 10.4% on a comparable basis and our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.9% compared to 5.8% last year. A gross profit rate decline of approximately 150 basis points was the primary driver of the lower operating income rate. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $188 million lower than last year, but were 40 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38 compared to $2.08 last year. A lower share count resulted in a $0.13 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. While our results were down to last year, our performance was ahead of our expectations we shared in our last earnings call. From a profitability standpoint, better-than-expected results were largely driven by disciplined expense management that resulted in favorable SG&A expense, both from a dollar and rate perspective. The favorable SG&A was partially offset by slightly lower gross profit rate which was primarily the result of more promotional environment than we expected. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year before providing insights into how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 10.8% to $9.8 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 10.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, October's year-over-year comparable sales decline of 15% was the largest decline while September was our best-performing month. Conversely, when comparing to the pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820 comparable period, October had the most growth, while holiday shopping was more prevalent this October compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820, it was lower than last year, when there was more of an urgency for consumers to get products early due to supply chain fears. In our International segment, revenue decreased 14.9% of $787 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.3% in Canada and a negative impact of 408 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Turning now to gross profit. our enterprise rate declined 150 basis points to 22%. Our domestic gross profit rate also declined 150 basis points, with the primary drivers consistent with expectations as well as the past two quarters. These drivers include: one, lower product margins, which were primarily due to increased promotions; two, lower services margins rates, including pressure from Totaltech; and three, the impact of higher supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's credit card arrangement. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. As Corie shared, we fully lapped last year's national rollout in October. As a result, the approximately 60 basis points headwind to last year from lower services margin rates was a sequential improvement from the past two quarters. Moving next to SG&A, as I stated earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $188 million while increasing 40 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the domestic segment, the primary drivers were lower incentive compensation and reduced store payroll costs. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $100 million this quarter and $365 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense, which excludes the impact from incentive compensation, was favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales. International SG&A was $150 million, decreased $21 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The decrease was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 23.8% versus 25% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% versus our previous guidance of approximately 23%. The lower outlook for the full year is primarily due to discrete tax matters in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $595 million and share repurchases of $455 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter and recently resumed repurchasing shares in early November. We now expect to spend a total of approximately $1 billion in share repurchases this fiscal year. We are committed to being a premium dividend payer based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal \u201823, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of non-GAAP net income. We view the target as a long-term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should fall outside the range in any 1 year. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. As we shared last quarter, the makeup of our capital expenditures looks a little different than last year with store-related investments representing a larger portion of our overall spending. Technology and digital capital are planned similar in terms of dollars versus last year, but its mix of overall capital spending is closer to 55% versus 75% last year. Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in our business, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $26 million of such restructuring costs in the third quarter and $61 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. We currently expect to incur additional charges to the fourth quarter for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter, starting with our top line expectations. We are planning for comparable sales to decline approximately 10% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. The improved outlook for the full year is entirely driven by our third quarter results as our expectations remain unchanged for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that the current macro environment trends will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Although the year-over-year sales decline in Q4 is expected to be similar to sales decline we just reported for Q3. Our outlook implies a larger deceleration versus the pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. As expected, the year-over-year sales decline for the first 3 weeks of November is similar to the decline we saw in October. Moving next to profitability. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income rate to be slightly higher than our previous guidance of approximately 4%. Similar to our top line expectations, this improvement is driven by our third quarter performance. Relative to our previous expectations, we now expect SG&A to be a little more favorable, whereas we are factoring in a little more gross profit rate pressure due to increased promotional activity. For the fourth quarter specifically, but we still expect a majority of the year-over-year operating income rate decline to be driven by lower gross profit rate. There is less pressure than prior quarters as we lap Totaltech and some of the supply chain inflationary impacts. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Sure. I'll start here. This is Matt. I think when you look at the Q4, similar to the whole year, it's been a bit difficult to properly reflect forecast in this environment. I think we're trying to plan appropriately with everything that we see, Q4 comp sales are expected to decline about 10%. This is a deceleration from FY \u201820 growth perspective as you think about the quarters as they progress this year. The holiday, we do expect to look a little different than last year. So probably more around the sales events, so less early shopping as we saw last year, but a more early shopping than we saw in fiscal \u201820. So from what we can see as we exited Q3 with October sales down around 15%. We're seeing November's sales start around that same amount. So we're at this point in line with our expectations. Holiday is obviously quite different than it has been over the prior quarters. So I think we're appropriately planned for where we see the consumer in front of us. Yes. I think consistent with our \u2013 what we talked about at the March Investor Day, I think we expect [the backbone] (ph) for our initiatives to help improve our rate as we look towards FY \u201825. So obviously, the world is much different than it was back then, and the program has continued to evolve, and we will continue to iterate. But I think we would expect the Totaltech to help provide a bit of rate improvement year-over-year as we look into next year, but probably more so even as we look into FY \u201825. Clearly, there is \u2013 we're learning a lot around the program and looking to make tweaks to the offer as we progress this next year from all the learnings we're having. So it would be our expectation that over time, it would help improve our rate from a pressure year-over-year. Yes. Consistent with what we've seen this year, most of that contraction is coming from transactions. ASPs have been a bit down, as we mentioned, and we expect them to probably come down a little bit in Q4. It's more of the transactions that are causing that top line deceleration on a year-over-year basis. But importantly, too, what we said is if you think about where we sit against FY \u201820 and Q3 and as we start our growth for this holiday season will likely come a little different than it did last year and more of those sale events driving more sales later into Q4 out of Q3. So for most of that organic is coming from transactions versus ASPs. Yes. There's probably a number of scenarios we are planning for next year, and we aren't going to provide guidance. But we try to lay out some puts and takes around what's happening in business now to provide some context. We just talked about it here. The largest drivers of our decline year-over-year versus pre-pandemic have been those investments we are making. And as we talked about, Totaltech, it also applies to health that we would expect some of those \u2013 some of the contraction to kind of abate a bit as we get into next year. But importantly, even as you look into FY \u201824. So, we would expect some of those initiatives, the pressure coming from would lessen a little bit as we get into next year, but more so even later into FY \u201825.  I think from a short-term incentive perspective, you are right, we will reset our performance tables next year, and we will likely have to add back anywhere from $200 million to $250 million of SDI expense when we reset those tables and start next year's plan. So, that will obviously be a pressure we are managing through. At this point, we don't necessarily see a lot of change to the product margin rates from next \u2013 from this year into next year. But obviously, we are early in our planning process. And lastly, you are right, most importantly, where our OI rate might \u2013 is going to be impacted by the level of sales that happened and we are still in the middle of trying to understand what type of sales environment will happen next year, but it is a large impact to how we plan what the overall rate will be. Sure. I think over the last number of years, the team has done an amazing job adjusting for a very different way of delivering to the customers. In my prepared remarks, we talked about how the core of our rate is actually slightly up compared to where it was pre-pandemic. And that's adjusting for \u2013 nearly doubling of the online mix in addition to absorbing all of the inflationary costs that we have seen over the last couple of years. So, that gives a little evidence to financially, we are able to actually do quite well in an environment where our dot-com business can reach those levels of penetration. So, we are absolutely agnostic \u2013 and on top of it, we just want to do what's right for the customer. The customers are going to lead us to where we need to be and our model can absorb that in any type of environment. Sure. Yes, computing, I will start with that. I think it was actually a large driver of a sales decline in Q3. But compared to FY \u201820, it was up 23%. So, we are still seeing very strong growth from the pre-pandemic period. We have seen a very large growth in the installed base over the past couple of years. Clearly, it's now being impacted by the level of the normalization, if you go from the spend. We are actually seeing a good start to Apple Plus program. We are actually seeing some customers mix towards some of the latest products versus opening price points. So, it's still relatively small and new, but that's a good start. Gaming continues to be a strong growth area compared to pre-pandemic in the computing space. So, so much of the gaming world is now kind of blending between gaming consoles and the computing arena and innovation continues on, and we expect that to continue. So, still down year-over-year, but still good strength and a great opportunity ahead of us. TVs, as you expect home theater did have negative comps as well. TVs or promotions are up on a year-over-year basis significantly. A lot more stronger inventory positions from our customers. And so we are still very confident about TVs going forward. Holiday is always a great environment for TV. ASP is down a little bit year-over-year. But again, we are seeing good mix into higher television sizes and premium products over the last couple of years. So, really encouraged by what the business could offer. I think to the confidence of the share repurchase question, I think we \u2013 I think appropriately just took some time to understand the environment ahead of us on last year's \u2013 in last quarter, just to make sure we were appropriately planning for the holiday period, giving our self enough space on inventory investment and where we need to sit from a working capital perspective and feel confident about our position in Q4 and where our inventory sits. And it is an establishment of confidence on where we sit financially and as we head into next year or so. You bet."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team's execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers during what is clearly a challenged environment for our industry. Customers have high expectations regarding service and we were pleased to see NPS improvements across many areas of our business as we continue to focus on creating differentiated experiences that customers will love into the future. Today, we are reporting Q3 financial results that are ahead of our expectations. Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term growth. Our comparable sales were down 10.4% on a year-over-year basis. This represents 8% revenue growth over the third quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820, which was consistent with the growth compared to fiscal \u201820 that we saw last quarter. As expected, our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year due to the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics, the investments in our growth initiatives and SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, was up 22% versus pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. We continue to manage our inventory effectively. Our inventory at the end of Q3 was down almost 15% from the third quarter of last year. This is more than our Q3 sales decline and projected Q4 sales due to a few factors. First, from a timing perspective, some receipts came in a few days later than expected and arrived just after the quarter closed. Additionally, due to supply constraints last year, we focused on bringing inventory in earlier to secure it for holiday. So October of last year ended with an unusually high level of inventory. For additional context, this year's $600 million in receipts moved from October into the first two weeks of November. This shift equates to about 8% of our inventory. The promotional environment continues to be considerably more intense than last year. Like Q2, the level of promotionality in Q3 was similar to pre-pandemic levels and in some areas was even more promotional as the industry works through excess inventory in the channel as well as response to softer customer demand. From a merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories. Consistent with the first half of the year, the largest impacts to our enterprise comparable sales came from computing and home theater. Compared to Q3 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue remains 23% higher and our appliances revenue remains 37% higher. Our blended average selling price, or ASP, in Q3 was down slightly on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as promotional activity that was largely absent during much of the pandemic has returned. Compared to fiscal \u201820, ASPs continue to be higher and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. This is due to two factors that have been driving ASPs higher for years and accelerated during the pandemic. First, category mix. We have driven material growth and mixed more into products like large appliances and large TVs, which carry high ASPs. Second, within categories, customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. I would like to pause here for a moment and talk about what we are seeing as it relates to consumer behavior. As I step back at the highest macro level across retail, each customer is making trade-offs, especially with the significant impact of inflation on the basics like food, fuel and lodging. This disproportionately impacts lower income consumers as a much larger proportion of their spend is on those basics. Across consumers, we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up and value clearly matters to everyone. During Q3, we continue to see more interest in sales events geared at exceptional value. As a result, there is no one way to describe all customers and we have repeatedly referred to the impacts of the current macro environment on consumers as uneven and unsettled. As it relates to our results as a specialty CE retailer, we saw relatively consistent behavior from our purchasing customers in Q3. Our demographic mix is basically steady versus last year and pre-pandemic. Our blended mix of premium product is higher, both units and dollars than last year and pre-pandemic. Within some specific categories, we can see some cohorts of customers trading down, but it is not aggregating into an overall impact. While sales are down in our signature categories as we lap the strong growth of the pandemic years, our initiative to expand our presence in adjacent categories is driving sales growth. While still small overall, we are driving sales growth in e-bikes and outdoor living categories as we expand to more stores in addition to our online assortment. Outdoor furniture, in particular, is demonstrating strong growth driven by new showrooms for our Yardbird assortment, including in our Best Buy stores and new standalone showrooms. From a health and wellness perspective, we launched over-the-counter hearing aids last month in almost 300 stores and online, including a new online hearing assessment tool. Volume is still relatively low, but the Q3 sales growth rate exceeded our expectations and demonstrates that customers see Best Buy as a relevant provider of these products. As you have all likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun and now more than ever, our customers are looking to bring joy back into their holiday celebration. Like we said in our last earnings call, we expect shopping patterns will look more similar to historical holiday periods than what we have seen in the last 2 years. Specifically, we expect there will be more customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday, and the two weeks leading up to December 25. Our results so far in October and the first 2 weeks of November have come in largely as expected and support this view thus far. From an inventory perspective, we have approached holiday strategically, placing bets in areas that require a longer lead time and taking a more flexible approach in other areas. We believe this gives us more room to invest and partner with vendors to changes in demand to provide additional sales opportunities. I would also stress that while November typically represents the largest influx of inventory in Q4, we will continue to receive inventory every week throughout the holiday season to replenish inventory levels. While aligning inventory levels with uncertain and evolving customer demand is always challenging, we are well positioned and feel confident we will be able to react quickly to changes we may see in customer demand. From a labor standpoint, we have seen a strong pool of applicants for seasonal associates to supplement our store team. This combined with our investments in wages over the past few years and comparably low turnover that remains close to pre-pandemic levels means we are ready to provide our customers the great service they expect to find in our stores. We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all our customers, including special promotions available to Totaltech and MyBestBuy members. We have curated gift list with inspiration for all from family members to foodies and content creators to gamers. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we have extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. We are also offering free next day delivery on thousands of items in addition to our convenience store and curbside pickup options. We feel confident heading into what could be an uneven holiday season and we have tailored our offerings to delight our customers whatever their budget. Strategically, as we look ahead, we are positioning ourselves to lead the way in the future of retailing. This is a future where the customer is in control and expect seamless experiences across all touch points. It is becoming more evident every quarter that the pandemic-induced shopping behavior changes are sticky and that our digital penetration of domestic sales will likely remain above 30%. For the first 9 months of the year, our online sales as a percentage of domestic revenue were 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. We expect that penetration rate to begin to increase again over time as it did pre-pandemic. Additionally, customer demand for other virtual interactions has remained elevated and we have seen strong and sustained sales growth from our investments in chat, phone and video sales experiences this year.  Of course, that also means that almost 70% of customers are shopping in our stores and customers representing 42% of our online sales pickup their products at our stores. As such, it is imperative we continue to invest in our stores and elevate our unique experiences. One way we are doing that is with our 35,000 square foot experience store remodel. We remain excited about these as we continue to see positive results from our longer running Houston and Charlotte remodels, including stronger sales, increased customer penetration and higher net promoter scores. These stores highlight broader assortment, including the opportunity to showcase the new categories I referenced earlier and really bring them to life. The remodels also include premium home theater and premium appliances, more space for consultations and services and expanded fulfillment capabilities like larger warehouses, in-store and curbside pickup and 24/7 lockers. Additionally, as you would expect, they all include the very best, most up-to-date vendor experiences showcasing premium merchandising and specialized labor. While market conditions have created a tough environment for delivering remodels, our incredible and dedicated team was able to deliver 42 of them by Black Friday. We plan to provide a broader update on our store portfolio refresh strategy at year end. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost effective ways. For example, we have introduced a new app for our associates called Solution SideKick that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and location. With the app, associates interacting with the customer can see the customers' profile in the moment, including historical purchases and active memberships. As the associate starts an order with product recommendations, the app automatically calculates total tax savings for existing and prospective members and recommends additional product solutions. Importantly, if a customer isn't ready to buy in the moment, associates can send the product recommendations and a recap of the conversation to the customer via e-mail, text or QR code so they can purchase later at their convenience. It is early, but we are very encouraged by the ramping employee adoption of the app and the higher revenue per transaction we are seeing when associates leverage Solution Sidekick. We are also leveraging our investment in electronic sign labels to provide a better and more efficient experience for customers who want to buy a product that is locked up or not readily available on the shelf. We have added new functionality that allows the customer to scan the QR code with their phone's camera and push a button notifying they are ready to purchase. This sends the store associate an instant and prioritized notification to pick the product and have it ready at pickup. We also took a much more digital approach when building out the experience for our 5,000 square foot store pilot we opened in Charlotte over the summer, highly leveraging these digital tools. Similar to the U.S., we are evolving our model in Canada as well and continue to see better-than-expected financial results there. We have been piloting initiatives there, including technology subscription, online marketplace, a market-focused test and small store formats. This expands our testing and innovation capabilities and provides opportunities to learn from their experiences when they are able to iterate faster and are further along in their pilots. We are excited to be able to innovate and leverage learnings on both sides of the border. Turning to membership, our Best Buy Totaltech offering is a very important initiative to drive deeper relationships with our customers. Last month, we passed the 1 year anniversary of our national launch and we are pleased to report that Totaltech is driving the member behavior we envision. Members are engaging more frequently with us and shifting their share of wallet to Best Buy. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our net promoter score from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than non-members. Nearly half of the new members joining the program in the past year were either new or lapsed customers reinforcing that the value of Totaltech resonates beyond our existing loyal customers. Very early retention data shows renewal rates running largely in line with our original expectations. Totaltech is a comprehensive membership with wide appeal across demographics. For example, younger generations and those with children utilize more of our newer warranty and member pricing benefits and older generations utilize more of our enhanced services and support benefit. Our associates continue to love the program since it clearly provides value to every single customer and simplifies the sales interaction. While we are encouraged by the results in the first full year, we will continue to iterate based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. As we said last quarter, we have been encouraged with the pace at which we have been acquiring new customers, considering the uniqueness of the offer, the macro environment and the decline in our product sales. Nevertheless, these factors have resulted in a lower member count than our original expectations. Last quarter, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members. And the early results continue to be positive. We are also activating on ways to continue to improve acquisition through our digital channel. From an optimization perspective, we will evolve the program in ways that also reduce our cost to serve. We have now lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact and anticipate the program to have a neutral impact on Q4 from a year-over-year perspective. Over time, we expect the program to contribute to operating income rate expansion as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In the current economic environment, many consumers are facing increasing financial constraints. We believe we are well positioned to meet customers' needs in this environment. In addition to creating key promotional moments, offering competitive prices, repairing and supporting existing products and scaling our Best Buy outlets, we offer multiple financing options to improve affordability. These include our co-branded Citibank credit card, lease-to-own program, buy now pay later options and most recently, our exclusive upgrades plus program for Apple Mac books. Upgrade+ powered by Citizens Pay is a brand-new program that allows customers to acquire MAC laptops and related accessories for a low monthly fee. After 3 years, they can easily turn in their old laptop and upgrade to the latest tech while they continue paying a low monthly fee. We can then refurbish this old laptop and offer it to a new customer through our outlet stores or digital platforms. This partnership with Apple is a great example of how we work with our vendors in unique ways to commercialize and showcase their technology innovation while also offering unique value and confidence to our customers. In a different example of a unique vendor partnership, we have started a pilot in the homebuilder space through a collaboration with Whirlpool and one of the top homebuilders in the U.S. to provide and install everything from connected doorbells and thermostats to large appliances. Though early, we have delivered 5 roughly 45 markets for the homebuilder, which is giving us great insight for how we maybe able to expand the pilot. Based on what we have learned, we see this model as an opportunity to partner with numerous other homebuilders to provide them similar or expanded solutions based on our capability. Before closing and turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and the communities we serve. The Best Buy Foundation's team tech centers are providing access, inspiration and opportunity for young people in the communities that need it most. We continue to expand the program with 52 team tech centers open across the country, including opening our 19 team tech center in the Twin Cities, our hometown. We also remain committed to creating an environment where all employees feel engaged and have access to specialized benefits and resources. We are proud to have women leaders at the highest levels of our company and believe it reflects our commitment to support our employees and their. This year, we are honored to rank #15 on Forbes 2022 list of the world's top female-friendly company, which recognizes companies that support women professionally and personally. Similarly, we were honored to be named as one of Forbes 2022 America's Best Employers for Veterans, our first time on that list. In summary, I am proud of our nimble execution this quarter and this year. Our teams have been navigating well through an incredibly dynamic environment and I want to thank them for their ingenuity, drive and commitment to our customers. There is, of course, ongoing macro uncertainty. And as we head through the holiday and into next year, we believe it will continue to be an uneven backdrop. Indicators remain unusually varied. The job market remains strong, consumer spending continues, and inflation appears to be slowing a bit, but savings are starting to erode. Consumer confidence is low. The housing market is cooling and inflation remains a particular concern on the basics like food, fuel and lodging, all of which have a profound and sustained impact. As you would expect, we are planning for multiple scenarios given the very unsettled and uneven consumer response to these varied indicators. We are adjusting our cost structure as we respond to current and potential future conditions. We are also making strategic decisions and trade-offs to continue to advance our initiatives. We are doubling down on our ability to lead the future of omnichannel retailer and capitalize on opportunities as the industry moves through this downturn and eventually returns to growth again. We are as confident and excited about our future as ever. Technology demand over the past few years has resulted in a larger installed base, and customers will want and need to replace and upgrade their tech devices, particularly as we near the 3-year mark since the start of the pandemic. At the same time, our technology vendor partners will continue to innovate and drive excitement and demand. We are the leading technology solutions provider for the home, a home increasingly dependent on all this technology working together and evolving over time. We are uniquely positioned to inspire and help customers with all aspects of their technology from deciding what to purchase, to installing it and getting the most out of it, all the way to helping when it's not working. We leverage our specialized Geek Squad agents, our expert sales associates and consultants, experienced merchants and sophisticated supply chain to deliver experiences no one else can in customers' homes, virtually, digitally and in our stores. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook. Thank you. Yes, I think I'd start with a holiday where \u2013 and I said it in the script but I mean it. I think people are really just looking for some joy in their holiday and what feels like a little bit more normal, I say that an [\u201choliday\u201d] (ph) versus the last couple of years, Peter. So I think what we see as exciting are those things families can do together. So things like televisions. And that's, again, not just the TV that's about streaming so much more content than people were before. Things like VR that take you to new places and allow you new experiences and are increasingly having more and more content availability, Gaming continues to be exciting for people. And that is a place where we're getting as much as we humanly can, but there still is some constraint, and we all know that drives a little bit of excitement. Health and wearables people really taking charge of their own health. We continue to see people very interested in taking control of health and fitness and their own abilities there and then still computing and tablets and this kind of productivity question. I mentioned it in the script. This is after almost 3 years now at the pandemic. You've got a cohort of people now who are looking for that latest and greatest in that ability to upgrade, stay on the go, keep their life in the kind of hybrid way that everyone is living. So the cool part \u2013 an then there is all the like fun little stuff that we sell that I think people forget, the great gifts that are in things like small appliances and indoor garden, a connected coffee cup that keeps your coffee warm. There is just this incredible array of really interesting products that technology continues to push the envelope on and evolve. And I think what we love most is these are gifts that change every single year. So for the great gift giver, I think we have a lot to offer. And Peter, I just want to make sure I reemphasize something that I said in the script here, which is the good news is it is doing what we want it to do. This is a program that's geared at those stickier, longer-term relationships with customers, being high consideration for customers and, therefore, driving up that frequency and that greater share of wallet. So I think those early indicators for us are very positive. Thank you. To your question about customer cohort, we don't \u2013 I mean, it varies a little bit week to week to week. But in general, what we've been seeing is a pretty consistent customer mix both versus last year and versus pre-pandemic. And when I say customer mix, I mean kind of demographically, we actually are seeing a pretty consistent mix of customers. Like I said, it can vary a little bit week-to-week depending on sales profiles and the values we are offering. But at the highest level, we are actually seeing pretty consistent behavior amongst our customer cohorts. Thank you. I think the Black Friday promotions started the day after Halloween. And for everyone, there is definitely a lot out there. I think if you rewind the clock for a second here, I actually was rummaging back through last year, and we actually said last year heading into Q4, we expected CE to be more promotional. And coming out of it, we said there were actually some categories last year that were as promotional as pre-pandemic. And as we headed into this year that we are in now, we said we expected the environment to get back to those pre-pandemic levels. I think it happened a little earlier than we thought. But in general, this is kind of how we expected that the year would play that by now we would be back to those pre-pandemic levels. And obviously, with some of the demand softening and customers targeting value, I think that's happening at even a more exacerbated rate. I think \u2013 and so there is that. We are even seeing some of this promotional intensity in the secondary channels as well because it's been well reported, there is a great deal of inventory out there in the channel. So, it's broad-based promotionality, which is a little bit different than a historical holiday where we really, really targeted against some of the certain product drive times. To your specific question about what areas we are seeing it in, we are seeing it across the board, honestly, but really mainly seeing it in some of the iconic traffic driving products, think about like headphones and wearables. And then you can imagine anywhere where the supply is really ample, we are also seeing some of that promotional activity in those spaces. And I think back to the question on like the Q4 guide and how we are thinking about it, I think that's part of what we see in the background and part of what we are trying to take into account as we look at a competitive environment going forward. Thank you. Yes. First, I just want to say, I give our teams a great deal of credit for navigating to your point, what has been an incredibly volatile backdrop. I think the expense and analytics of our teams really shines in moments like this. So, we talked a bit in the prepared comments about \u2013 some of this is just a shift in timing. Last year, recall, inventory levels were really challenged. And so everyone was trying to bring in inventory really early, and there was lots of customer demand really early because people were worried about not being able to get the products throughout the holiday. This year as we said, we expected the holiday to shape a little bit more traditionally like pre-pandemic, and therefore, our inventory flows are moving more in that direction. And we specifically said in places where we have longer lead time categories, we placed some of those bets earlier and then allowed ourselves a little bit more ability to maneuver on those items that don't take quite as much long lead time. There are always some spotty places where we wish we had more inventory. This is almost always true in consumer electronics. I mentioned gaming consoles, that's commonly a place. And I think there has been some conversation about some of the more iconic phones and the production there and availability there. So, that's not anything that's new that's kind of typical as we head into holiday. But those will really be some of the spaces where we would add more. And what I like is that we have a lot of room to maneuver throughout the holiday in partnership with our vendors. As we think about where the demand profiles might ebb and flow, we can bring that inventory in, and we said it. We bring in the majority in November, but we replenish the whole holiday season, and this allows us the room to bring in really what's resonating with customers. I will start a bit and then Matt can add in. What I actually believe that this combination of omnichannel is our strength. And not only are we agnostic, we love it when customers are using the multitude of channels that we have and that includes consultations at home that includes our virtual channels like chat and phone that includes online and that includes stores. And so I \u2013 instead of just even saying agnostic, I actually would say we want to double down on a customer, who wants to shop us across all those channels. Matt, maybe you can provide some of the profitability color. Thank you. Not right now, we are not going to kind of give the exact numbers and some of the science behind it. I think it's fair to say as we head into next year, we will probably give a little bit more color on what we are seeing there. And as you can imagine, it's very hard to parse out the two pieces there. I think what we are remaining focused on is striking the balance between what really resonates with our customers and accomplishes what we want in terms of share of wallet and frequency. And the cost of the program and ensuring that when we are investing in the program, it makes sense, and it's in those pieces that really resonate over the long-term, again, with our customers. And I think \u2013 I am not trying to skirt the question. It is going to take us a little bit of time to parse those things because the frequency that we have with our customers is a little bit different than some other retailers. And so as we are assessing just whether or not this program is doing what we want and to your specific question, why people are choosing to or not to enroll, it's going to take us a little bit of time to pull those pieces apart. Yes. We haven't really given the quantity of stores yet that we want to do into next year. And we actually mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are planning to give an update as we head into next year on our kind of experience refresh plan. I think it's important to note that everything that we are doing, we are trying to root in this really incredibly elevated shopping experience with this broader assortment, expanded fulfillment, best vendor experiences. And while we haven't given specific numbers, we have said we continue to see really good and improved sales results out of at least the two that have been opened more than 2 years now. And NPS results consistently in those as well. So, we continue to remain bullish on them now. We just opened a bunch of that 42 here recently. So, we are going to read on how they are performing out of the gate. But like I said, we will give you more of an update on our future plans as we head into next year. You too. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. If I take a really large step back, I think Matt did a nice job in his prepared remarks saying quarter-to-quarter, it is really difficult to sort through all the laps to what you said on stimulus, on stores open, stores close, promotionality, all of those things. And so instead, I think at the sequentials all get difficult. At the end of the day, we are trying to take the biggest step back and look at a consumer that we know is really facing trade-off decisions. Obviously, especially when you have inflation on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging, and we know this definitely impacts lower income consumers to a greater extent. I mean almost 70% of spend in the lowest income earners are on those kind of basics versus more like 55% for the higher income earners. So, you have got a large proportion of your spend going there. And so we know that people are looking for value across all of those cohorts, and there is no easy one way to describe the consumer. It's very uneven depending on how you came out of the pandemic, and it's very unsettled. You can see that even just in some of the confidence numbers while people are trying to sort their way. I think as it relates to us specifically, and again, specialty CE retailer, we are actually seeing relatively consistent behavior, and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks. Our demographic mix is essentially steady versus both last year and pre-pandemic. If anything, it's moved just a touch more into the lower income brackets. And our blended mix of premium product is higher, both in units and dollars than both last year and pre-pandemic. And we did that on a very specific like price point, SKU kind of level to look at where people were really opting into those more premium. Now, obviously, within some specific categories, we are seeing some cohorts of customers trading down, but it's not aggregating at this point into an overall impact that we are seeing consistently across every single category. So, it can depend like you might see different behaviors in back-to-school than you might see as we are heading into holiday here. But at the highest level, we are actually seeing the consumer behaves relatively similarly as we did even pre-pandemic, I think more so, it's the overarching decisions about how they are going to make those trade-off decisions between things like services and restaurants and vacations and goods and those base needs that they have. Thank you. I would almost go back to how we talked about holiday pre-pandemic. And holiday is always a very different time of the year. This is about really making targeted decisions about when, how and where any retailer wants to be promotional. And we have, I would argue, a good long history of deciding where and how within the holiday, we want to be promotional. That doesn't mean you go toe-to-toe on exactly the same items, exactly the same days with every other retailer. It means you create a pretty foundational holiday plan and then you stick to that pivoting as you see where the customer might have more interest. To your point, that means you are partnering with vendors way upstream prior to holiday to really think through what we think is both going to resonate with the customer but also hit those promotional price points that make sense. Obviously, we are committed to being competitive on price and our own data would actually say we have improved our price competitiveness, both compared to last year and compared to pre-pandemic. So, not only are we baseline, I think more competitive, we are then obviously picking those targeted. And I talked about it a lot in the prepared remarks, places where we can offer value. And for us, that's across the spectrum of price points, especially when we are still seeing consumers bear towards those more premium products, we are really going to try to offer any budget, that sense of value and we are going to, in a targeted way, decide where and how we want to play throughout the holiday. And I think that is really the foundation of how Matt and the team have tried to forecast what we expect in Q4. And with that, I think that's our last question. I want to thank you all so much for \u2013 thank you, Brad. I want to thank you all so much for joining us today. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in February. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nMollie O'Brien : Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am incredibly proud of our teams as they continue to rise to the challenges over the past few years. With so much going on that is beyond their control, I remain impressed at their ability to manage the rapidly shifting business environment and priorities. As we said in March, we expected our financial results would be softer this year as we lapped record sales volumes. However, the macro environment has been more challenged and uneven than expected due to several factors. And that has put more pressure on our industry, changing the trajectory of our business versus our original plan.  We are focused on balancing our near-term response to difficult conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also delivering on our strategic initiatives and what will be important for our long-term growth. Our strategy and our confidence in it remains unchanged. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us in a world that is more reliant on technology than ever. We are a financially strong company with a resilient world-class team that will successfully navigate the current environment.  Now on to the second quarter results we reported this morning. Our comparable sales were down 12.1% as we lapped strong Q2 comparable sales last year of almost 20%. This represents 8.3% sales growth over the second quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year on the SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue, the investments in our growth initiatives and the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was up 43% versus pre-pandemic fiscal '20.  We are clearly operating in a volatile consumer electronics industry. We assume the CE industry would be lower following 2 years of elevated growth, driven by unusually strong demand for technology products and services and fueled partly by stimulus dollars. In addition, we expected to see some impact to our business as customers broadly shifted their wallet spend back into experience areas, such as travel and entertainment. We did not expect and compounding these impacts as a changing macro environment where consumers are dealing with sustained and record high levels of inflation in some of the most fundamental parts of their daily lives, like food.  While these factors have led to an uneven sales environment, they have not deterred us from continuing to make progress on our initiatives. During the quarter, we drove broad customer NPS improvements even compared to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in installation and repair. We signed up new Best Buy Totaltech members and increased our delivery speed, delivering almost 1/3 of customer online orders in one day. We also completed store remodels, opened new outlet stores and began implementing newly signed deals with health care companies.  From a top line perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories, with the largest impacts to comparable sales coming from computing and home theater. Although down from last year's strong sales compared to Q2 of fiscal '20, our computing revenue has grown more than 20%. Our Domestic appliance business comparable sales declined slightly as it laps more than 30% growth in the second quarter of last year, and revenue is up more than 45% compared to fiscal '20.  Our data would tell us that customers are making some decisions to trade down, particularly those in lower income households. This is not across all categories. But for example, in the television category, customers are moving more into our lower price point exclusive brands products. We're also seeing more interest in sales events, such as Prime Day, tax-free events and other events geared at exceptional value. I applaud our team's proactive management of our inventory during the quarter as we saw the sales trajectory changing.  Our inventory at the end of Q2 was down 6% from the second quarter of last year and up approximately 16% from pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Overall, our inventory is healthy and reflects an evolving mix of product in our network, including more high ASP appliances and larger-screen televisions, which also have longer lead times and a slower inventory turn. While we took more inventory markdowns than last year, the level reflected a normalization to pre-pandemic activity.  Within our inventory numbers, there are categories where we have ample inventory supply and still pockets where we are constrained. In our industry, it's not as simple as we have inventory or we don't. It can be incredibly variable by product and even brands within a particular product. For example, we are also still experiencing inventory constraints in key models and brands across computing and gaming.  As we move into the back half of the year, we are planning inventory thoughtfully, yet investing strategically for holiday. While it is important to manage inventory against current demand, we also want to ensure we are well positioned to react to the ever-changing consumer needs. The promotional environment was more intense than last year and even more than we expected entering the quarter as sales demand softened. Some areas were quite aggressive from a promotional standpoint, especially where inventory was ample or in excess. Overall, we feel the level of promotionality has returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Over the past few years, we have seen gross profit pressure from higher supply chain costs, which, of course, includes increased parcel costs from our higher mix of online sale. In addition, we estimate that roughly half of the increased supply chain cost this quarter versus the comparable period in fiscal '20 is being driven by cost increases or inflationary pressures. Conditions across the global supply chain continue to evolve. On a year-over-year basis, we saw higher costs in Q2 and expect that to continue through the remainder of the year. However, we are starting to see some signs that the market is stabilizing and moderating.  During the pandemic, the capacity and rate pressure started in International and works their way to Domestic logistics. Now we are experiencing some relief in International first and early signs of loosening markets domestically. For example, in Ocean Logistics, we are taking advantage of some rate opportunities, but continue to be mindful of ILWU labor discussions and overall U.S. port congestion as we move into the peak shipping season. As it relates to inbound Domestic transportation, while we are starting to see a more balanced capacity market, we continue to see inflationary pressures from higher fuel and labor costs and rail yard and general supply chain network congestion.  I would like to provide an update on Totaltech, our unique membership program designed to provide customers with complete confidence in their technology, with benefits that include member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery, and standard installation and 24/7 tech support. Considering the macro environment and decline in our product sales, we are encouraged with the pace at which we are acquiring new members. In Q2, nearly half of the new members joining the program were either new or lapsed customers, reinforcing how the value of this program resonates beyond our existing loyal customers.  Our associates continue to embrace the program as the fulsome nature of the offering not only simplifies the sales interaction, it also is a program our team members can confidently stand behind as they believe in the value it provides to every single customer. In July, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members, and their early results have been positive. At this point in the national launch, we continue to be encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we're seeing from customers who have signed up to become members.  As we have previously shared, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer-term benefits. Over time, we expect the incremental spend we garner from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. As I've just covered, there are several things we are seeing with the program that give us confidence that customers value the membership and that our thesis in general is playing out. At the same time, consumer electronics is a low-frequency category. And we are in a unique macro environment, meaning it will take time for us to truly assess the performance. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor the program and iterate on the offering as we learn more.  In addition to Totaltech, our Best Buy branded credit card continues to drive a valuable and sticky relationship with our customers. We continue to see growth in cardholders. More than 25% of our revenue is transacted on our Best Buy branded card. And cardholders have been increasing the use of their card outside Best Buy stores as well. These customers tend to be more engaged with Best Buy over time, with higher frequency and spend than non-cardholders. Combined with our partners' largest lease-to-own portfolio and our buy now, pay later test, this means we can offer our customers a variety of ways they can shop confidently with us. And we can leverage those relationships into our future.  As we emerge from the pandemic, it is clear that our customer shopping behavior has changed. Our online sales as a percentage of Domestic revenue in Q2 was 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. Virtual revenue via video, phone and chat is growing rapidly as well, as sales for the first 6 months of the year are already almost equal to the virtual revenue we generated for all of last year. While still small overall, sales in our virtual store are ramping quickly. And we recently expanded categories to include appliances and home theater. In addition, our high NPS in-home interactions continue to increase rapidly. In fact, in-home installations have seen double-digit growth versus the prior year in 5 of the last 6 quarters and year-to-date in-home sales consultations are up more than 30% over last year and pre-pandemic.  Of course, our stores remain incredibly important for customers to see and touch products and get advice. In addition, they're crucial to our fulfillment strategy. In the second quarter, customers representing 42% of our online sales chose to pick up their products at our stores and an additional 18% of online sales were shipped out of our store to customer homes. These in-store pickup and ship from store numbers have remained incredibly consistent for the last several years, even as shipping speed and options have dramatically increased. It is imperative that we evaluate how we operate and service of these evolving customer needs and make the necessary adjustments to ensure we come out of this not just a vital company, but a vibrant one.  We tested new field operating models in 4 markets over the past year to help us better understand how to deploy leadership resources in a more digital world. As a result of these tests, earlier this month, we made structural changes to our operating model that resulted in some store roles being eliminated. We hope to retain as many of these talented associates as possible. This is one component of our enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced this quarter. With these changes, we are able to reinvest back into frontline customer-facing sales associates.  We are continuing to reimagine our physical presence in ways that cater to our customers' changing shopping patterns as well. As part of our Charlotte holistic market approach pilot, we are testing a new 5,000 square foot store with a unique digital-first approach. Just opened last month, the store includes a 7-foot tall digital display that customers will see as they enter the store that explains what's new and how customers can shop. The store includes curated assortments across our product categories, except for major appliances and other large products. The majority of products will primarily be on display to touch and try.  To purchase, customers can scan the QR code on any product price tag using their phone. This immediately sends a notification to a Best Buy employee to pick up the product from the store's backroom and bring it to the register for checkout. Of course, customers who want to will be able to consult with sales associates, in-home consultants and Geek Squad agents, who always have access to our complete assortment online using our increasingly rapid shipping. From an online sales fulfillment perspective, the store offers both in-store pickup and convenient lockers.  The Charlotte market pilot also includes a traditional core store that we converted to an outlet store. The outlet has an expanded assortment of product categories, a dedicated team of employees and agents that rapidly quality check and repair all product for resale, a new services repair hub and spoke model, and an Autotech mega hub for car tech installation. This outlet is performing extremely well and is frankly on track to deliver revenue on par to the pre-converted conventional store, with a considerably lower operating cost and greater productivity. Those results give us confidence in our outlet strategy.  During the quarter, we opened 2 new outlet stores in Virginia and Phoenix and just opened a location in Chicago earlier this month, bringing us to 19 locations. We see twice the recovery rate of our COGS when we sell open box, clearance and end-of-life inventory at our outlets versus alternative channels. With assortment expanded to include major appliances, large TVs, computing, gaming and mobile phones, we believe now is an opportune time to appeal to our existing Best Buy customers as well as an increasingly deal-seeking consumer overall.  Our outlet store assortment is also available for purchase online, with many products eligible for national ship-to-home fulfillment as well as local store pickup. This capability unlocks a very productive way to refurbish inventory, giving it a new life, while also serving a deal-seeking customer. We still plan to double the number of outlets to approximately 30, although some may not open until fiscal '24. So far this year, we have invested in and completed 7 experienced store concept remodels. The results we are seeing in the existing 2 pilot remodels, including higher NPS and higher customer spend, continue to make us confident in and excited about this part of our strategy. We expect to complete a total of approximately 40 experienced store remodels this year.  I am very proud of how much work the team has done to test and iterate multiple store and operating model concepts over the past few years in response to the dramatic pivot in customer behavior. We introduced a great deal of change into the field, not always perfectly. And we have learned and accelerated some initiatives while stopping others. On top of that, of course, the macro backdrop has shifted and the trajectory of the business has changed significantly in an incredibly short time.  We continue to invest in our people and our stores, with an eye toward the best possible customer experience, leveraging our unique differentiators. Through all the changes, overarching store NPS is substantially higher than pre-pandemic, including more stores than we have ever seen at what we consider to be best-in-class level. This is entirely due to our amazing store associates' hard work and dedication to always being there for our customers. We have consistently invested in our employees over the past 3 years, including raising hourly wages more than 20% versus pre-pandemic and adding additional benefits, such as paid caregiver leave, financial hardship assistance and paid time off for part-time employees. Now I would like to touch on Best Buy Health. Our consumer health business, where we curate health and wellness products online and in our stores, is largely experiencing similar revenue trends as our core category. We are excited about the new FDA ruling that allows the sale of over-the-counter hearing aid. We just announced an expanded collection of hearing devices, an in-store experience in more than 300 stores and a new online hearing assessment tool, making it more convenient than ever for the millions of Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to get the products and support they need.  During the second quarter, we continued to see strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. Revenue for this business was slightly up in the quarter compared to last year.  We are encouraged by the momentum we have built in the virtual care business in the first half of the year. We are very focused on successfully implementing the large U.S. health system accounts that have been won recently, including NYU Langone Health for hospital at home and Mount Sinai Health Systems for chronic disease management. And we are also making progress leveraging our Best Buy capabilities in this space. Our Geek Squad team successfully completed additional health training in Q2 and launched a new Geek Squad pilot service with Geisinger Health. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from virtual care is currently very small and will take time to ramp as health industry has a longer return on investment.  We just published our 17th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the company to make a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers and communities. We continue to focus on ESG initiatives that drive sustainable long-term value creation. Last year, we made significant progress toward our goals to reduce our carbon footprint, attain our 2025 hiring commitments and expand our Best Buy Teen Tech Center program. We recently hit a milestone with the Best Buy Foundation Teen Tech Centers when we opened one earlier this month in Gary, Indiana, marking our 50th Teen Tech Center. These centers provide teens from disinvested communities with guidance, training and tech access to help successfully prepare them for the future.  In terms of the environment, we continue to drive forward the circular economy, a system in which nothing is wasted. Since 2009, we have reduced our carbon emissions 62% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions 75% by 2030. And last year, we became a founding member of the Breakthroughs 2030 Retail Campaign, which aims to accelerate climate action within our industry.  We continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., collecting more than 2.5 billion pounds since 2009. We also made significant progress toward our fiscal '25 hiring commitment to help ensure we build an inclusive, diverse and thriving workforce. In fiscal '22, we filled 37% of new salaried corporate positions with black, indigenous and people of color employees, ahead of our goal to fill 1 in 3 position. And we filled 26% of new salaried field positions with women employees, marking progress on our goal to fill 1 of 3 positions. We're proud that 60% of our most senior leaders, including our Board of Directors and Executive team, is made up of women and people of color. We encourage you to review our full ESG report available on our corporate website.  In summary, the first half of the year has been difficult from a sales perspective. And our employees have executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases, making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers.  I just want to take a moment to address the fiscal '25 financial goals we introduced in March. We remain confident in the strategic premise covered in March. However, the current macro backdrop has changed in ways that we and many others were not expecting. As such, we are removing these targets. And we'll share more context on our midterm financial expectations once we begin to experience a more stable operating environment.  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are managing thoughtfully and carefully, while still investing in our future. This includes actively assessing further actions to evolve our operating model, manage profitability and iterate on our growth initiatives. We fundamentally believe that technology is more important than ever in our everyday lives. And as a result of the past few years, consumers have even more technology devices in their homes that will need to be updated, upgraded and supported over time. As our vendor partners continue to innovate and the world becomes increasingly more digital in all aspects, we will be there to uniquely help customers in our stores, online, virtually and directly in their homes. This company has navigated monumental change, riding incredible highs and managing difficult lows since our founding 56 years ago. As we have done throughout our history, we will use this moment to lead and double down on our purpose, making it clear that we continue to uniquely support customers in ways literally no one else can.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for additional details on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. \nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. I will walk through details on our Q2 results before providing insight into how we are thinking about the back half of the year.  Enterprise revenue of $10.3 billion declined 12% on a comparable basis as we lapped very strong 20% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1% compared to 6.9% last year. As expected and similar to last quarter, our investment in Totaltech membership added approximately 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to last year. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $129 million lower than last year, but were 120 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 decreased $1.44 or 48%. A lower share count resulted in a $0.16 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. However, it was offset by a higher non-GAAP tax rate.  In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 13.1% to $9.6 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 12.7%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, fiscal June's comparable sales decline of 16% was the largest decline, whereas fiscal July was our best performing month during the quarter compared to both last year and to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 comparable period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater.  In our International segment, revenue decreased 9.3% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 4.2% in Canada and the negative impact of 420 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. This marks the first quarter where Mexico was fully removed from the prior year comparison.  Turning now to gross profit. Our enterprise rate declined 160 basis points to 22.1%. The Domestic gross profit rate declined 170 basis points, which was primarily driven by the lower services margin rates, including pressure from Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. These items were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from the company's credit card arrangement.  As a reminder, the approximately 100 basis points of gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. Our product margin rates were lower than our expectations in Q2, driven by higher levels of promotionality. Generally, lower consumer demand has combined with the higher levels of inventory across the CE industry, which has resulted in more discounting across most of our categories. As Corie mentioned, overall, the level of promotionality has returned to pre-pandemic levels, which is slightly ahead of our expectations earlier in the year.  Moving next to SG&A. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $129 million, while increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of approximately $135 million.  Let me add some additional details on the incentive compensation expense, which year-to-date is approximately $265 million lower than last year through the second quarter. Based on our current outlook for this year, we are expecting to be below the required financial thresholds for short-term incentive performance metrics. This compares to last year when payouts were near the maximum levels. As a result, we anticipate additional incentive compensation favorability in the second half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 16.7% versus 8.4% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% versus our previous guidance of approximately 24%. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $840 million in cash. As Corie mentioned, at the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 6% lower than last year's comparable period. And we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $862 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $465 million and dividends of $397 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter, spending only $10 million. Looking forward, we will continue to assess the appropriate timing for resuming share repurchases.  We are committed to being a premium dividend payer. Based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal '23, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of our non-GAAP net income. We viewed this target as a long-term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should it fall outside of the range in any one year.  From a capital expenditure standpoint, we now expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. This is slightly lower than our previous outlook of approximately $1.1 billion. However, it exceeds the level of investment we have been making over the past few years. The largest driver of the increased spend this year compared to prior trends is store-related investments. This includes both our 40 experiential store remodels, as Corie mentioned, as well as general improvements in a number of our other locations after delaying the work the past couple of years during the pandemic.  Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year, starting with our revenue assumptions. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, we are assuming comparable sales for the year to decline in the range of around 11%, which represents a comparable sales decline for the remainder of the year and is similar to what we just reported for Q2. In addition, this reflects an assumption that our revenue growth versus fiscal '20 will continue to slow and that revenue in the second half of the year will be very similar to comparable pre-pandemic fiscal '20 time period. This is due to a belief that the current macro environment trends could be even more challenging and have a larger impact for the remainder of the year.  This aligns with the trends we are seeing so far this quarter as August revenue declined approximately 10% versus last year. When comparing to fiscal '20, August revenue increased in the low single-digit range, which is a sequential decline from the second quarter trends. Our outlook for a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4% for the year is anchored to our negative 11% comparable sales assumption. This represents a decrease of 200 basis points to last year, with roughly half of the decline from lower gross profit rate and half from higher SG&A rate.  As you may recall, our original guidance entering the year included a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of approximately 60 basis points, which was expected to come almost entirely from the gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the primary driver. The pressure we are expecting from Totaltech continues to align with our original expectations, while the additional gross profit rate pressure in our revised outlook is largely due to higher promotional activity in the consumer electronics industry.  From an SG&A standpoint, we have continued to lower our forecasted SG&A spend as the year has progressed, but not at the same pace as our lowered sales expectations. As I shared earlier, our outlook for the year assumes incentive compensation to be significantly below prior year levels. Compared to last year in our original outlook, we are planning for lower store payroll expenses and other variable expenses. We've also reduced spend in discretionary areas by increasing the rigor around backfilling corporate roles, capital expenditures and travel. Partially offsetting these items are increased investments compared to last year in Best Buy Health, technology and our store remodel work.  Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in business trends, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending to critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $34 million of such restructuring costs in the second quarter, primarily related to termination benefits. We currently expect to incur additional charges to the remainder of fiscal 2023 for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results.  Lastly, let me share a couple of comments specific to the third quarter. We anticipate that our third quarter comparable sales declined slightly more than the negative 12% we reported for the second quarter. We anticipate the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will be similar to or slightly higher than our second quarter results. This includes a little less gross profit rate pressure as we lap the last year's national rollout of Totaltech during the quarter. However, we expect a little more SG&A rate deleverage in Q3 from the larger sales decline.  I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. \nGreg Melich: I'd love to finish where you -- or start where you finished, which was the third quarter guidance on margin decline and what it implies for the fourth quarter. I want to make sure that, that OI decline that would be in basis points versus the second quarter down to 60. And does that imply that in the fourth quarter, EBIT margin should only be down maybe 50 bps and would be well above 4% in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up. \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes. I think based on the implied comments for Q3, what we said is a similar OI rate decline as Q2, if not slightly higher, which is about 280 basis points on the math. It would imply that Q4 does improve from an EBIT rate perspective, the gross margin rate pressure in Q4 will abate a bit compared to the previous quarters as we've lapped the Totaltech. And we're beginning to lap some of the product margin rate pressures we experienced last year as promotionality started to return. But you're starting to see more SG&A to leverage in Q4 considering where sales are trending in comparison to the prior quarters. \nGreg Melich: Got it. And my follow-up was more on the top line on the consumer. I think, Corie, you mentioned seeing some trade down in some categories. Could you talk about which categories you're not seeing it in and where there seems to be a good sell-through and whatever you can get? \nCorie Barry: Yes. I mean there's -- there are categories where the price points and decisions around the type of product matter. Large TVs is the example we use. There are other categories like let's take mobile phones where it's not as much a decision between trading up or trading down. You want a certain brand. You want a certain type of phone. And so -- or even some of what we're seeing in gaming, where as much of the kind of gaming hardware as we can get our hands on, the consumer is looking to purchase. So that's why it isn't perfectly even throughout the categories in our business, in particular, because sometimes, you're very brand-specific. And then sometimes, you're more brand-agnostic and you're just looking for the right experience. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman : I wanted to ask about just the high-level backdrop. Realized a year ago, things felt different in terms of sales and promotions. I wanted to ask you, Corie, is it getting easier to predict the business, is the visibility getting better? Meaning, are we bottoming in certain categories in terms of units? And then as you look around the corner to whether it's -- I don't know if it's promotions creating the deflation or it's consumers trading down. But do you see a flattening that the current environment we're in is starting to stabilize?\nCorie Barry: I wouldn't say it's become phenomenally easier to exactly see around the corner. Simeon, I give our teams a great deal of credit for working hard to catch trends quickly. I think what makes the current environment the most volatile that I've seen is the quantity of inventory at other retailers and the promotional activity correspondingly the markdowns with some of those heavier inventory levels. I think that's the part that right now makes the business a little more volatile. I think as some of those inventory levels normalize a little bit more, then I do think you're perhaps in a more normalized environment. And Matt even hit on it when he was talking about the Q4 EBIT rate. You start to lap some of those promos that we actually started to see in consumer electronics a more promotional environment in Q4 of last year.  So I think as you work through the back half of this year, Simeon, my point of view is it starts to stabilize a little bit. But I hedge that just because there's so much inventory that's in the marketplace right now, A; and B, it is still a really volatile macro environment. And I think you've got a very uneven consumer who is making corresponding choices depending on how long inflation lasts, and like I said in my prepared remarks, especially in those core categories like food, rent, housing. So I'd love to say it's perfectly stabilizing, and we can predict it, but I still think you have a lot of factors at play that are influencing consumer behavior. \nSimeon Gutman : And maybe the follow-up, is the promotions creating year-over-year price deflation in the categories, or is it the lack of innovation where you're already starting at \"year-over-year\" deflationary price point and then promotions are compounding that? And I guess the promotionality is the piece that resolves it or is there innovation around the corner where you -- where the industry moves back to some type of inflation? \nCorie Barry: So 2 pieces. One, right now, I believe the impact is mainly promotionality, because you've had really a sustained period here of a couple of years where it was disproportionately low promotionality because there was such high demand and such low inventory levels. And so right now, it really is a function of those promotions coming back.  To your second point, this is a really important part of the thesis and what I think is important about Best Buy. Our vendors who are sure are going to continue to innovate, looking for that kind of next cool product, that will continue to drive demand. And so I think my hypothesis is, it's been a little harder to have all your innovation engines flexing here in the last 2 years when you're trying so hard to produce at the levels that we've needed. So every ounce of energy has kind of been focused on production. And I think that in the future here, as especially these inventory levels normalize, I think you've got a number of vendors who are really interested in.  Now that you have this much larger installed base of connected devices in people's homes, they're also going to be very interested in how do you upgrade those devices, how do you connect those devices, how do you help a customer live in their homes, which still increasingly people are spending more time in. So I think that's the next phase, Simeon, that I believe we'll see from here, which is more of that innovation engine. And it's always been true in CE. And the hardest part is I cannot always tell you exactly what the next innovation is going to be. But we definitely know that behind the scenes, you continue to see innovations in spaces like what you just talked about hearing, in spaces like computing, with hybrid work models clearly becoming the future and some of the replacement cycles there even speeding up a bit. So I think that will be the next level. But for right now, you're really just kind of course correcting for 2 years that were very, very low in terms of promotionality. \nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets.\nAnthony Chukumba : I guess my question was on the back-to-school selling season. Now you talked about the fact that August was down. August comps were down about 10%. And I guess, what does that say about how back-to-school performed? And is there any read through for back-to-school for holiday? I know they're different. But I don't know if that gives you any indication or any thoughts about the upcoming holiday selling season. \nCorie Barry: Yes. Thanks, Anthony. For us, the back-to-school sales are actually slightly ahead of our, what I'll call, kind of tempered expectations. And it's following a trend that was really more pertinent prior to the pandemic, which is people were shopping later and later. And not super surprising given that this is a very different school year than we've seen for the past 2 years. And you probably got parents and kids who are just kind of really trying to figure out, how do I gear up for a year that at least is starting out much more in person and especially at the collegiate level much more on-campus. So if anything, it's been a little bit better than we had thought and it's following that same trajectory. In terms of implications for the holiday, I think it's less about what does back-to-school portend. I think it's more about kind of broadly what we're seeing. So we mentioned we're seeing a customer who's more value-oriented, who is definitely moving more towards some of those sale events. And so I think our hypothesis is you're going to see a holiday that starts to look a little bit more like what we saw pre-pandemic. Maybe comes a little bit later, it's probably promotional in our space. That's part of what is embedded in the guide that Matt talked about.  And I think it's going to be, my personal point of view, a little harder to pull those sales into October when there's not -- remember, for 2 years, in October, we were yelling at the consumer, make sure that you get your inventory because there isn't enough. Obviously, the backdrop looks a little different there. And so I think you might have a consumer who's willing to wait, look for the deals and really look for those great values. And again, like I said, I'm not sure back-to-school is the indicator of that. I think that's just more broadly what we're seeing in the macro and in the consumer. \nOperator: Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. \nChris Horvers: So I'll follow up on the prior question initially. So as you think about the minus 10% sales in August to date and a later arriving back to school, that would suggest you still have a few weeks ahead of you. But then the October's compare much harder. So are you basically taking the 3-year comp trend and degrading it into the rest of the quarter? \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes. That's what the -- Chris, that's what the numbers would imply. I think 10% in August, if you think about the sequential stack of Q3 on a 3-year basis, with a comp that's slightly below a 12% that we saw in Q2, would imply that it's in the low single-digit area of comp performance for the entirety of the quarter. So yes, that's what assumes a sequential declining as the year progresses, and especially into Q3 and Q4. \nChris Horvers: Got it. And then have you -- I'm curious what -- how you're thinking about sort of unit pull forward versus dollar volume? Because obviously, to your point, Corie, dollar volumes are being exaggerated right now because of the level of inventory in the market. So how are you thinking about like the everlasting question of pull forward around the pandemic and share of wallet on the unit side within the computing and TV category?\nCorie Barry: Maybe I'll start and then Matt can add on. I think we are watching both sides of the equation carefully, both the kind of ASP side of things and also the unit side of things. Broadly, on the whole, we're seeing a stabilization of ASPs year-over-year. And so you can imply in that, obviously, you're seeing a bit of unit decline. And I think what's interesting right now is you've still got a consumer who is spending on the whole quite a bit. I think they're being choosier, and it's uneven as to where they're spending. And so I think it makes it a little hard to answer the question exactly how much is pulled forward because you're against a very different backdrop than you were even 6 months ago.  I think what is -- again, and I'll go back to it, what for us is most compelling is that no matter what, you have a massively higher installed base that is in people's homes and people are spending more time in their homes than ever. And in a category like computing, we can already see that some of those upgrade cycles are happening a little bit faster than they were before. So that would imply, more than anything, it was more incremental purchases, and then you'll see that upgrade over time. And again, I mean, now it's been 2.5 years since some of the original computing devices were purchased at the very beginning of the pandemic. So you're going to have some compelling use case changes here over the next year or 2.  So it's a long way of saying, I think it's difficult against the current macro backdrop to make a precise indication of how many units were pulled forward and how much was incremental. I think instead, we remain focused on making sure we have the right inventory there for our customers and being ready as they're more ready to upgrade their devices. \nOperator: The next question comes from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. \nLiz Suzuki: So regarding the pulling of the fiscal '25 targets that were originally communicated in March, what do you think is the biggest change that's occurred in the last 5 to 6 months? And is it more of the top line growth expectations that have become less attainable or the longer-term margin target? \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes, I'll start and Corie can jump in. Yes, I think if you look at where we planned the year to be, at the beginning of the year, we planned comps in the minus 1% to minus 4% range. And now what we're seeing is it's around a minus 11% comp for the year. It's a pretty significant sales decline, again, more around the macro environment worsening. We expected the year to come down from an industry perspective as we cycle some of the very large growth over the last couple of years. So that change of the macro and the consumer has really caused the sales to be much lower this year. So I would say that's probably the biggest impact as you think about our FY '25 targets going forward because some of the targets that also need scale to drive some of the benefits of the bottom line as well. So that's what we need time to assess. \nCorie Barry: The only thing I would add is that, and I said in the prepared remarks, but it bears repeating, strategically, what we laid out, we still have incredible confidence in. And that's why we want to make sure we're getting updates on some of those strategic investments that we're making. I think the baseline of where we're starting from, to Matt's point, is quite different than what we originally assumed. \nLiz Suzuki: Got it. Okay. So I mean, in theory, we could think about some of those targets as just being still achievable, but a little further down the line than what you originally thought given where the year is going to shake out.\nMatthew Bilunas: I think the premise of us continue to grow our business and drive more efficiency and profitability in the business over time is absolutely what we intend to do as we think about once the business stabilizes and operationally, the strategies are all very sound, and we're very pleased with how they're progressing. It's just that the backdrop as much than it was. \nOperator: Michael Lasser, UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Putting aside the next quarter or 2, as you look towards next year, given some of the changes that you've made, like the restructuring, the rollout of the outlet locations and other streamlining, could your operating margin be flat to up on a flat to down sales number? \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes, maybe. I mean I think what we're trying to do is assess what this year looks like. We're trying to, as you can imagine, fortify our business a bit and understand how do we point resources and work towards the strategically relevant important things as we -- as well as the operations. And I think what we're trying to do is continue to assess the top line environment, the macro environment to understand where sales will go next year, all the while knowing that the sales growth, the CAGR leading up to the pandemic through FY '20, the last 3 years, was over 3%. So we believe the industry, we believe Best Buy will return to growth at some point as we navigate some of these choppier waters. At the same time, we're taking the right steps forward to optimize our business and set ourselves up structurally as we look forward into next year and the years after that and drive our strategy at the same time. \nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is on Totaltech support. You now will be lapping the full rollout this quarter. Given some of the longer tenure of the original members, are you seeing the sales lift from those folks that would justify the return on investment? And would you expect that the behavior of those newer members will be different? And if not or if it is, would you think about potentially rolling back Totaltech support if it wasn't meeting your return hurdles? \nCorie Barry: So we chatted a bit in the prepared remarks and said we still like what we were seeing in terms of -- for right now, and again, we haven't even lapped a year, in terms of the engagement and the spend of the existing cohort of Totaltech support members. We also said, just like you would with any membership program, we are going to keep looking at the benefits that are included, what customers value, what keeps customers sticky to Best Buy, and we will continue to iterate on the offer. So I don't think it's as simple as a light switch, like is it on or is it off? I think there's a lot about the offer and behaviors that we're seeing that is really compelling.  And at the same time, we want to make sure that the offer is used and is engaging for customers and is over time keeping them sticky to the brand. And we said it in the remarks, it is difficult because frequency is lower in our category, so it takes us more time, especially against the macro backdrop that has changed as dramatically as this one has. It's going to take us more time to assess. Over the long term, is this doing what we want it to do? And so for right now, we like what we're seeing in the cohort of customers. It's still early. It's against an uneven backdrop. And we're going to continue to iterate on the offer to make sure, at the end of the day, what's most important is that it keeps customers engaged with the brand.\nOperator: Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: So I have 2 questions. Maybe I'll just merge them together. I mean, first off, with regard to sales, are you seeing any increased variability across geographically or otherwise that would maybe tie this more together with either inflationary pressures or some of the lasting effects of the pandemic? And then my second question, I guess just stepping back, thinking about the different drivers of sales. From a manufacturing standpoint, your manufacturing partners, has there been a pullback on -- through the pandemic, through the supply chain constraint, it's pull back on sort of say, driving innovation that may be changing now as some of these constraint keys that could ultimately become a better sales driver? \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes, sure. I'll start and then Corie can add on. Brian, I think from a sales perspective, from a geography base, I think nothing we would necessarily call out. I would say though that in some of our test markets, we are seeing good results in terms of how we're looking at our store portfolio. And in fact so, we are seeing a bit of improvement on some of our experiential stores that we've rolled out. And we've rolled out 2, we're rolling out more, and we've seen a good lift in some of those locations. And so some of the tests are yielding some positive results from a store portfolio. But that wouldn't necessarily mean it's due to inflation being different across the country. \nCorie Barry: Yes. We hit on this a little bit earlier, Brian. But I do think our manufacturing partners have been doing everything they can to produce as much product as possible over the last 2 years. So kind of writ large, if you think about the industry broadly. And a hypothesis would be that does make it a little bit more difficult to innovate at the pace that you would like because you're just working so hard to produce what you need to for the demand that's in front of you.  And so I think as hopefully, you start to see a more -- a little bit more normalized demand environment, that absolutely -- I can't imagine a world where the manufacturers that we work with aren't working morning, noon and night to try to think through how to innovate on the products that we have today to drive more of that replacement, more of that consumption going forward. And so I don't have an exact measurement to tell you how much are they innovating last year versus next year. But I absolutely fundamentally believe, you've got a manufacturer set that is looking to capitalize on an increasingly digital consumer who is more and more willing to use these products in their home. \nOperator: Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. \nKate McShane: I just wondered if you could help us think through the Totaltech support, not to beat a dead horse with regards to Totaltech support. But just with regards to its impact to gross margins. I know you're lapping the launch. But is it a bigger headwind sequentially? Just thinking through that maybe more people are going to come through the store for back-to-school and holiday versus maybe the first half.\nMatthew Bilunas: No. I'll start and Corie can add if she like. Kate, it's not a -- it doesn't -- the pressure does not increase as we get into the back half of the year. In fact, it abates a bit as you get into Q3 as we lap the launch. And so even with the higher volumes expected coming through in Q3 or Q4 from a holiday perspective doesn't necessarily create more pressure effectively on a year-over-year basis. It mitigates as the quarters progress. At the beginning of the year, we talked about how the pressure this year was between 60 and 80 basis points, and that's about what we are seeing right now for the year. On a pre-pandemic basis, it would represent about 100 basis points of pressure from where we were before. But again, as we -- as we scale that offer and we sign up more people, the pressure subsides as you scale on those sales over time when you drive more incremental product sales. \nCorie Barry: I think the key here is that the goal of the program is ultimately to create an offer that has further reach and has a broad appeal. And that, over time, we drive frequency and greater share of wallet with our customers. Obviously, that's going to take time. And to Matt's point, it's not that it's any more impactful. Actually, as we start to get scale, it is helpful on the Total business because you are in theory growing that frequency and growing that share of wallet. It just takes us time to get there. \nKate McShane: Okay. And my follow-up question is, aside from some of the labor adjustment that you made, just where you're focused on reducing costs and better -- to better align costs with demand? \nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. I think we have probably a whole lot more to say. As you can imagine, we're still working through those plans, and we would want to share internally as well before. I think the $34 million termination is basically termination benefits that we took in Q2. The 2 aspects of that are the voluntary early retirements and then the workforce optimization. Those are what we've done so far. We'll continue to evaluate other actions. But broadly speaking, we're looking to understand how our business has changed over the last number of years with a digital business that's now double what it used to be in a very different looking consumer to understand where do we need to point our resources and efforts strategically and operationally to make sure we're prepared for how our customers want to shop and providing the best experience for them. And so that will ultimately provide some -- also some efficiency opportunities as we look forward, but also just strategically position us better as we navigate through some of the difficult macro environments that we're seeing right now. \nOperator: We'll now take our -- we have time for one last question today from Mike Baker from DA Davidson. \nMike Baker : Okay. I wanted to ask about the promotions and inventories a little bit, just to follow up on that. What areas are you more or less promotional in? And it sounds like the issue to me -- it sounds like -- it looks like your inventory is pretty clean. It's down 6%, but competitors are still heavy. Do you expect that to be a situation to be rectified by the holidays? And then one last question, if I could squeeze it in. Any comments particularly on what you're seeing in terms of gaming trends within the entertainment category, which was down about 9%, a little bit better than the Total? How did gaming perform within that?\nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. Overall, as we said, promotionality is a bit higher than in Q2 than we expected, and we built those expectations into the remaining part of the year. What we're seeing is generally more -- most of our categories are returning to pre-pandemic levels. So there really isn't -- there's always a few areas that may not be quite back there yet. But generally, we're back to where our levels of promotionality were before the pandemic started. And that has more to do with the general amount of inventory in the channel right now that, as the consumer demand wanes and inventory increases, there's just generally the dynamic of having more promotionality. It's less around needing to mark down our inventory more because it's not in a healthy position. It is a very healthy position. It's simply just normalizing to where we were pre-pandemic. And so that marketplace competitive dynamic is what's driving a little bit of that promotionality. Again, maybe not as much as others because we started the year expecting promotionality return to pre-pandemic at some point. It's just happening a little bit faster.  In terms of gaming, it still continues to be an area where if we had more inventory, we would be able to sell it. The demand outpaces the supply as well. I think we're seeing actually some -- the gaming console side of the business is relatively flat to last year. We're seeing a little bit more pressure year-over-year from a software perspective and a peripheral perspective. But if you think about where gaming, if you took all of gaming, not just the console cycles, you took in PC gaming and you brought in VR and all the things related to a gaming area, it's actually up over 50% in Q2 versus the pre-pandemic level. So it's seeing a lot of growth over the last couple of years, although like most categories, Total is coming down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. \nCorie Barry: Mike, the last thing that I would add on the inventory question is, it is a -- I'm very proud of the work that the teams have done. I'm proud to head into holiday in a good healthy inventory position. And we said it in the prepared remarks, that allows us a little bit more space to invest in those places where we think there really will be consumer demand. So I think it is a really good situation to be in.  And with that, I think yours was the last question. Thank you all so much for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our results and our progress during our next call in November. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. I will walk through details on our Q2 results before providing insight into how we are thinking about the back half of the year.  Enterprise revenue of $10.3 billion declined 12% on a comparable basis as we lapped very strong 20% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1% compared to 6.9% last year. As expected and similar to last quarter, our investment in Totaltech membership added approximately 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to last year. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $129 million lower than last year, but were 120 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 decreased $1.44 or 48%. A lower share count resulted in a $0.16 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. However, it was offset by a higher non-GAAP tax rate.  In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 13.1% to $9.6 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 12.7%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, fiscal June's comparable sales decline of 16% was the largest decline, whereas fiscal July was our best performing month during the quarter compared to both last year and to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 comparable period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater.  In our International segment, revenue decreased 9.3% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 4.2% in Canada and the negative impact of 420 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. This marks the first quarter where Mexico was fully removed from the prior year comparison.  Turning now to gross profit. Our enterprise rate declined 160 basis points to 22.1%. The Domestic gross profit rate declined 170 basis points, which was primarily driven by the lower services margin rates, including pressure from Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. These items were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from the company's credit card arrangement.  As a reminder, the approximately 100 basis points of gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. Our product margin rates were lower than our expectations in Q2, driven by higher levels of promotionality. Generally, lower consumer demand has combined with the higher levels of inventory across the CE industry, which has resulted in more discounting across most of our categories. As Corie mentioned, overall, the level of promotionality has returned to pre-pandemic levels, which is slightly ahead of our expectations earlier in the year.  Moving next to SG&A. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $129 million, while increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of approximately $135 million.  Let me add some additional details on the incentive compensation expense, which year-to-date is approximately $265 million lower than last year through the second quarter. Based on our current outlook for this year, we are expecting to be below the required financial thresholds for short-term incentive performance metrics. This compares to last year when payouts were near the maximum levels. As a result, we anticipate additional incentive compensation favorability in the second half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 16.7% versus 8.4% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% versus our previous guidance of approximately 24%. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $840 million in cash. As Corie mentioned, at the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 6% lower than last year's comparable period. And we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $862 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $465 million and dividends of $397 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter, spending only $10 million. Looking forward, we will continue to assess the appropriate timing for resuming share repurchases.  We are committed to being a premium dividend payer. Based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal '23, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of our non-GAAP net income. We viewed this target as a long-term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should it fall outside of the range in any one year.  From a capital expenditure standpoint, we now expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. This is slightly lower than our previous outlook of approximately $1.1 billion. However, it exceeds the level of investment we have been making over the past few years. The largest driver of the increased spend this year compared to prior trends is store-related investments. This includes both our 40 experiential store remodels, as Corie mentioned, as well as general improvements in a number of our other locations after delaying the work the past couple of years during the pandemic.  Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year, starting with our revenue assumptions. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, we are assuming comparable sales for the year to decline in the range of around 11%, which represents a comparable sales decline for the remainder of the year and is similar to what we just reported for Q2. In addition, this reflects an assumption that our revenue growth versus fiscal '20 will continue to slow and that revenue in the second half of the year will be very similar to comparable pre-pandemic fiscal '20 time period. This is due to a belief that the current macro environment trends could be even more challenging and have a larger impact for the remainder of the year.  This aligns with the trends we are seeing so far this quarter as August revenue declined approximately 10% versus last year. When comparing to fiscal '20, August revenue increased in the low single-digit range, which is a sequential decline from the second quarter trends. Our outlook for a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4% for the year is anchored to our negative 11% comparable sales assumption. This represents a decrease of 200 basis points to last year, with roughly half of the decline from lower gross profit rate and half from higher SG&A rate.  As you may recall, our original guidance entering the year included a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of approximately 60 basis points, which was expected to come almost entirely from the gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the primary driver. The pressure we are expecting from Totaltech continues to align with our original expectations, while the additional gross profit rate pressure in our revised outlook is largely due to higher promotional activity in the consumer electronics industry.  From an SG&A standpoint, we have continued to lower our forecasted SG&A spend as the year has progressed, but not at the same pace as our lowered sales expectations. As I shared earlier, our outlook for the year assumes incentive compensation to be significantly below prior year levels. Compared to last year in our original outlook, we are planning for lower store payroll expenses and other variable expenses. We've also reduced spend in discretionary areas by increasing the rigor around backfilling corporate roles, capital expenditures and travel. Partially offsetting these items are increased investments compared to last year in Best Buy Health, technology and our store remodel work.  Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in business trends, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending to critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $34 million of such restructuring costs in the second quarter, primarily related to termination benefits. We currently expect to incur additional charges to the remainder of fiscal 2023 for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results.  Lastly, let me share a couple of comments specific to the third quarter. We anticipate that our third quarter comparable sales declined slightly more than the negative 12% we reported for the second quarter. We anticipate the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will be similar to or slightly higher than our second quarter results. This includes a little less gross profit rate pressure as we lap the last year's national rollout of Totaltech during the quarter. However, we expect a little more SG&A rate deleverage in Q3 from the larger sales decline.  I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Yes. I think based on the implied comments for Q3, what we said is a similar OI rate decline as Q2, if not slightly higher, which is about 280 basis points on the math. It would imply that Q4 does improve from an EBIT rate perspective, the gross margin rate pressure in Q4 will abate a bit compared to the previous quarters as we've lapped the Totaltech. And we're beginning to lap some of the product margin rate pressures we experienced last year as promotionality started to return. But you're starting to see more SG&A to leverage in Q4 considering where sales are trending in comparison to the prior quarters. Yes. That's what the -- Chris, that's what the numbers would imply. I think 10% in August, if you think about the sequential stack of Q3 on a 3-year basis, with a comp that's slightly below a 12% that we saw in Q2, would imply that it's in the low single-digit area of comp performance for the entirety of the quarter. So yes, that's what assumes a sequential declining as the year progresses, and especially into Q3 and Q4. Yes, I'll start and Corie can jump in. Yes, I think if you look at where we planned the year to be, at the beginning of the year, we planned comps in the minus 1% to minus 4% range. And now what we're seeing is it's around a minus 11% comp for the year. It's a pretty significant sales decline, again, more around the macro environment worsening. We expected the year to come down from an industry perspective as we cycle some of the very large growth over the last couple of years. So that change of the macro and the consumer has really caused the sales to be much lower this year. So I would say that's probably the biggest impact as you think about our FY '25 targets going forward because some of the targets that also need scale to drive some of the benefits of the bottom line as well. So that's what we need time to assess. I think the premise of us continue to grow our business and drive more efficiency and profitability in the business over time is absolutely what we intend to do as we think about once the business stabilizes and operationally, the strategies are all very sound, and we're very pleased with how they're progressing. It's just that the backdrop as much than it was. Yes, maybe. I mean I think what we're trying to do is assess what this year looks like. We're trying to, as you can imagine, fortify our business a bit and understand how do we point resources and work towards the strategically relevant important things as we -- as well as the operations. And I think what we're trying to do is continue to assess the top line environment, the macro environment to understand where sales will go next year, all the while knowing that the sales growth, the CAGR leading up to the pandemic through FY '20, the last 3 years, was over 3%. So we believe the industry, we believe Best Buy will return to growth at some point as we navigate some of these choppier waters. At the same time, we're taking the right steps forward to optimize our business and set ourselves up structurally as we look forward into next year and the years after that and drive our strategy at the same time. Yes, sure. I'll start and then Corie can add on. Brian, I think from a sales perspective, from a geography base, I think nothing we would necessarily call out. I would say though that in some of our test markets, we are seeing good results in terms of how we're looking at our store portfolio. And in fact so, we are seeing a bit of improvement on some of our experiential stores that we've rolled out. And we've rolled out 2, we're rolling out more, and we've seen a good lift in some of those locations. And so some of the tests are yielding some positive results from a store portfolio. But that wouldn't necessarily mean it's due to inflation being different across the country. No. I'll start and Corie can add if she like. Kate, it's not a -- it doesn't -- the pressure does not increase as we get into the back half of the year. In fact, it abates a bit as you get into Q3 as we lap the launch. And so even with the higher volumes expected coming through in Q3 or Q4 from a holiday perspective doesn't necessarily create more pressure effectively on a year-over-year basis. It mitigates as the quarters progress. At the beginning of the year, we talked about how the pressure this year was between 60 and 80 basis points, and that's about what we are seeing right now for the year. On a pre-pandemic basis, it would represent about 100 basis points of pressure from where we were before. But again, as we -- as we scale that offer and we sign up more people, the pressure subsides as you scale on those sales over time when you drive more incremental product sales. Sure. I think we have probably a whole lot more to say. As you can imagine, we're still working through those plans, and we would want to share internally as well before. I think the $34 million termination is basically termination benefits that we took in Q2. The 2 aspects of that are the voluntary early retirements and then the workforce optimization. Those are what we've done so far. We'll continue to evaluate other actions. But broadly speaking, we're looking to understand how our business has changed over the last number of years with a digital business that's now double what it used to be in a very different looking consumer to understand where do we need to point our resources and efforts strategically and operationally to make sure we're prepared for how our customers want to shop and providing the best experience for them. And so that will ultimately provide some -- also some efficiency opportunities as we look forward, but also just strategically position us better as we navigate through some of the difficult macro environments that we're seeing right now. Sure. Overall, as we said, promotionality is a bit higher than in Q2 than we expected, and we built those expectations into the remaining part of the year. What we're seeing is generally more -- most of our categories are returning to pre-pandemic levels. So there really isn't -- there's always a few areas that may not be quite back there yet. But generally, we're back to where our levels of promotionality were before the pandemic started. And that has more to do with the general amount of inventory in the channel right now that, as the consumer demand wanes and inventory increases, there's just generally the dynamic of having more promotionality. It's less around needing to mark down our inventory more because it's not in a healthy position. It is a very healthy position. It's simply just normalizing to where we were pre-pandemic. And so that marketplace competitive dynamic is what's driving a little bit of that promotionality. Again, maybe not as much as others because we started the year expecting promotionality return to pre-pandemic at some point. It's just happening a little bit faster.  In terms of gaming, it still continues to be an area where if we had more inventory, we would be able to sell it. The demand outpaces the supply as well. I think we're seeing actually some -- the gaming console side of the business is relatively flat to last year. We're seeing a little bit more pressure year-over-year from a software perspective and a peripheral perspective. But if you think about where gaming, if you took all of gaming, not just the console cycles, you took in PC gaming and you brought in VR and all the things related to a gaming area, it's actually up over 50% in Q2 versus the pre-pandemic level. So it's seeing a lot of growth over the last couple of years, although like most categories, Total is coming down a little bit on a year-over-year basis."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am incredibly proud of our teams as they continue to rise to the challenges over the past few years. With so much going on that is beyond their control, I remain impressed at their ability to manage the rapidly shifting business environment and priorities. As we said in March, we expected our financial results would be softer this year as we lapped record sales volumes. However, the macro environment has been more challenged and uneven than expected due to several factors. And that has put more pressure on our industry, changing the trajectory of our business versus our original plan.  We are focused on balancing our near-term response to difficult conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also delivering on our strategic initiatives and what will be important for our long-term growth. Our strategy and our confidence in it remains unchanged. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us in a world that is more reliant on technology than ever. We are a financially strong company with a resilient world-class team that will successfully navigate the current environment.  Now on to the second quarter results we reported this morning. Our comparable sales were down 12.1% as we lapped strong Q2 comparable sales last year of almost 20%. This represents 8.3% sales growth over the second quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year on the SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue, the investments in our growth initiatives and the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was up 43% versus pre-pandemic fiscal '20.  We are clearly operating in a volatile consumer electronics industry. We assume the CE industry would be lower following 2 years of elevated growth, driven by unusually strong demand for technology products and services and fueled partly by stimulus dollars. In addition, we expected to see some impact to our business as customers broadly shifted their wallet spend back into experience areas, such as travel and entertainment. We did not expect and compounding these impacts as a changing macro environment where consumers are dealing with sustained and record high levels of inflation in some of the most fundamental parts of their daily lives, like food.  While these factors have led to an uneven sales environment, they have not deterred us from continuing to make progress on our initiatives. During the quarter, we drove broad customer NPS improvements even compared to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in installation and repair. We signed up new Best Buy Totaltech members and increased our delivery speed, delivering almost 1/3 of customer online orders in one day. We also completed store remodels, opened new outlet stores and began implementing newly signed deals with health care companies.  From a top line perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories, with the largest impacts to comparable sales coming from computing and home theater. Although down from last year's strong sales compared to Q2 of fiscal '20, our computing revenue has grown more than 20%. Our Domestic appliance business comparable sales declined slightly as it laps more than 30% growth in the second quarter of last year, and revenue is up more than 45% compared to fiscal '20.  Our data would tell us that customers are making some decisions to trade down, particularly those in lower income households. This is not across all categories. But for example, in the television category, customers are moving more into our lower price point exclusive brands products. We're also seeing more interest in sales events, such as Prime Day, tax-free events and other events geared at exceptional value. I applaud our team's proactive management of our inventory during the quarter as we saw the sales trajectory changing.  Our inventory at the end of Q2 was down 6% from the second quarter of last year and up approximately 16% from pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Overall, our inventory is healthy and reflects an evolving mix of product in our network, including more high ASP appliances and larger-screen televisions, which also have longer lead times and a slower inventory turn. While we took more inventory markdowns than last year, the level reflected a normalization to pre-pandemic activity.  Within our inventory numbers, there are categories where we have ample inventory supply and still pockets where we are constrained. In our industry, it's not as simple as we have inventory or we don't. It can be incredibly variable by product and even brands within a particular product. For example, we are also still experiencing inventory constraints in key models and brands across computing and gaming.  As we move into the back half of the year, we are planning inventory thoughtfully, yet investing strategically for holiday. While it is important to manage inventory against current demand, we also want to ensure we are well positioned to react to the ever-changing consumer needs. The promotional environment was more intense than last year and even more than we expected entering the quarter as sales demand softened. Some areas were quite aggressive from a promotional standpoint, especially where inventory was ample or in excess. Overall, we feel the level of promotionality has returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Over the past few years, we have seen gross profit pressure from higher supply chain costs, which, of course, includes increased parcel costs from our higher mix of online sale. In addition, we estimate that roughly half of the increased supply chain cost this quarter versus the comparable period in fiscal '20 is being driven by cost increases or inflationary pressures. Conditions across the global supply chain continue to evolve. On a year-over-year basis, we saw higher costs in Q2 and expect that to continue through the remainder of the year. However, we are starting to see some signs that the market is stabilizing and moderating.  During the pandemic, the capacity and rate pressure started in International and works their way to Domestic logistics. Now we are experiencing some relief in International first and early signs of loosening markets domestically. For example, in Ocean Logistics, we are taking advantage of some rate opportunities, but continue to be mindful of ILWU labor discussions and overall U.S. port congestion as we move into the peak shipping season. As it relates to inbound Domestic transportation, while we are starting to see a more balanced capacity market, we continue to see inflationary pressures from higher fuel and labor costs and rail yard and general supply chain network congestion.  I would like to provide an update on Totaltech, our unique membership program designed to provide customers with complete confidence in their technology, with benefits that include member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery, and standard installation and 24/7 tech support. Considering the macro environment and decline in our product sales, we are encouraged with the pace at which we are acquiring new members. In Q2, nearly half of the new members joining the program were either new or lapsed customers, reinforcing how the value of this program resonates beyond our existing loyal customers.  Our associates continue to embrace the program as the fulsome nature of the offering not only simplifies the sales interaction, it also is a program our team members can confidently stand behind as they believe in the value it provides to every single customer. In July, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members, and their early results have been positive. At this point in the national launch, we continue to be encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we're seeing from customers who have signed up to become members.  As we have previously shared, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer-term benefits. Over time, we expect the incremental spend we garner from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. As I've just covered, there are several things we are seeing with the program that give us confidence that customers value the membership and that our thesis in general is playing out. At the same time, consumer electronics is a low-frequency category. And we are in a unique macro environment, meaning it will take time for us to truly assess the performance. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor the program and iterate on the offering as we learn more.  In addition to Totaltech, our Best Buy branded credit card continues to drive a valuable and sticky relationship with our customers. We continue to see growth in cardholders. More than 25% of our revenue is transacted on our Best Buy branded card. And cardholders have been increasing the use of their card outside Best Buy stores as well. These customers tend to be more engaged with Best Buy over time, with higher frequency and spend than non-cardholders. Combined with our partners' largest lease-to-own portfolio and our buy now, pay later test, this means we can offer our customers a variety of ways they can shop confidently with us. And we can leverage those relationships into our future.  As we emerge from the pandemic, it is clear that our customer shopping behavior has changed. Our online sales as a percentage of Domestic revenue in Q2 was 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. Virtual revenue via video, phone and chat is growing rapidly as well, as sales for the first 6 months of the year are already almost equal to the virtual revenue we generated for all of last year. While still small overall, sales in our virtual store are ramping quickly. And we recently expanded categories to include appliances and home theater. In addition, our high NPS in-home interactions continue to increase rapidly. In fact, in-home installations have seen double-digit growth versus the prior year in 5 of the last 6 quarters and year-to-date in-home sales consultations are up more than 30% over last year and pre-pandemic.  Of course, our stores remain incredibly important for customers to see and touch products and get advice. In addition, they're crucial to our fulfillment strategy. In the second quarter, customers representing 42% of our online sales chose to pick up their products at our stores and an additional 18% of online sales were shipped out of our store to customer homes. These in-store pickup and ship from store numbers have remained incredibly consistent for the last several years, even as shipping speed and options have dramatically increased. It is imperative that we evaluate how we operate and service of these evolving customer needs and make the necessary adjustments to ensure we come out of this not just a vital company, but a vibrant one.  We tested new field operating models in 4 markets over the past year to help us better understand how to deploy leadership resources in a more digital world. As a result of these tests, earlier this month, we made structural changes to our operating model that resulted in some store roles being eliminated. We hope to retain as many of these talented associates as possible. This is one component of our enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced this quarter. With these changes, we are able to reinvest back into frontline customer-facing sales associates.  We are continuing to reimagine our physical presence in ways that cater to our customers' changing shopping patterns as well. As part of our Charlotte holistic market approach pilot, we are testing a new 5,000 square foot store with a unique digital-first approach. Just opened last month, the store includes a 7-foot tall digital display that customers will see as they enter the store that explains what's new and how customers can shop. The store includes curated assortments across our product categories, except for major appliances and other large products. The majority of products will primarily be on display to touch and try.  To purchase, customers can scan the QR code on any product price tag using their phone. This immediately sends a notification to a Best Buy employee to pick up the product from the store's backroom and bring it to the register for checkout. Of course, customers who want to will be able to consult with sales associates, in-home consultants and Geek Squad agents, who always have access to our complete assortment online using our increasingly rapid shipping. From an online sales fulfillment perspective, the store offers both in-store pickup and convenient lockers.  The Charlotte market pilot also includes a traditional core store that we converted to an outlet store. The outlet has an expanded assortment of product categories, a dedicated team of employees and agents that rapidly quality check and repair all product for resale, a new services repair hub and spoke model, and an Autotech mega hub for car tech installation. This outlet is performing extremely well and is frankly on track to deliver revenue on par to the pre-converted conventional store, with a considerably lower operating cost and greater productivity. Those results give us confidence in our outlet strategy.  During the quarter, we opened 2 new outlet stores in Virginia and Phoenix and just opened a location in Chicago earlier this month, bringing us to 19 locations. We see twice the recovery rate of our COGS when we sell open box, clearance and end-of-life inventory at our outlets versus alternative channels. With assortment expanded to include major appliances, large TVs, computing, gaming and mobile phones, we believe now is an opportune time to appeal to our existing Best Buy customers as well as an increasingly deal-seeking consumer overall.  Our outlet store assortment is also available for purchase online, with many products eligible for national ship-to-home fulfillment as well as local store pickup. This capability unlocks a very productive way to refurbish inventory, giving it a new life, while also serving a deal-seeking customer. We still plan to double the number of outlets to approximately 30, although some may not open until fiscal '24. So far this year, we have invested in and completed 7 experienced store concept remodels. The results we are seeing in the existing 2 pilot remodels, including higher NPS and higher customer spend, continue to make us confident in and excited about this part of our strategy. We expect to complete a total of approximately 40 experienced store remodels this year.  I am very proud of how much work the team has done to test and iterate multiple store and operating model concepts over the past few years in response to the dramatic pivot in customer behavior. We introduced a great deal of change into the field, not always perfectly. And we have learned and accelerated some initiatives while stopping others. On top of that, of course, the macro backdrop has shifted and the trajectory of the business has changed significantly in an incredibly short time.  We continue to invest in our people and our stores, with an eye toward the best possible customer experience, leveraging our unique differentiators. Through all the changes, overarching store NPS is substantially higher than pre-pandemic, including more stores than we have ever seen at what we consider to be best-in-class level. This is entirely due to our amazing store associates' hard work and dedication to always being there for our customers. We have consistently invested in our employees over the past 3 years, including raising hourly wages more than 20% versus pre-pandemic and adding additional benefits, such as paid caregiver leave, financial hardship assistance and paid time off for part-time employees. Now I would like to touch on Best Buy Health. Our consumer health business, where we curate health and wellness products online and in our stores, is largely experiencing similar revenue trends as our core category. We are excited about the new FDA ruling that allows the sale of over-the-counter hearing aid. We just announced an expanded collection of hearing devices, an in-store experience in more than 300 stores and a new online hearing assessment tool, making it more convenient than ever for the millions of Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to get the products and support they need.  During the second quarter, we continued to see strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. Revenue for this business was slightly up in the quarter compared to last year.  We are encouraged by the momentum we have built in the virtual care business in the first half of the year. We are very focused on successfully implementing the large U.S. health system accounts that have been won recently, including NYU Langone Health for hospital at home and Mount Sinai Health Systems for chronic disease management. And we are also making progress leveraging our Best Buy capabilities in this space. Our Geek Squad team successfully completed additional health training in Q2 and launched a new Geek Squad pilot service with Geisinger Health. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from virtual care is currently very small and will take time to ramp as health industry has a longer return on investment.  We just published our 17th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the company to make a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers and communities. We continue to focus on ESG initiatives that drive sustainable long-term value creation. Last year, we made significant progress toward our goals to reduce our carbon footprint, attain our 2025 hiring commitments and expand our Best Buy Teen Tech Center program. We recently hit a milestone with the Best Buy Foundation Teen Tech Centers when we opened one earlier this month in Gary, Indiana, marking our 50th Teen Tech Center. These centers provide teens from disinvested communities with guidance, training and tech access to help successfully prepare them for the future.  In terms of the environment, we continue to drive forward the circular economy, a system in which nothing is wasted. Since 2009, we have reduced our carbon emissions 62% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions 75% by 2030. And last year, we became a founding member of the Breakthroughs 2030 Retail Campaign, which aims to accelerate climate action within our industry.  We continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., collecting more than 2.5 billion pounds since 2009. We also made significant progress toward our fiscal '25 hiring commitment to help ensure we build an inclusive, diverse and thriving workforce. In fiscal '22, we filled 37% of new salaried corporate positions with black, indigenous and people of color employees, ahead of our goal to fill 1 in 3 position. And we filled 26% of new salaried field positions with women employees, marking progress on our goal to fill 1 of 3 positions. We're proud that 60% of our most senior leaders, including our Board of Directors and Executive team, is made up of women and people of color. We encourage you to review our full ESG report available on our corporate website.  In summary, the first half of the year has been difficult from a sales perspective. And our employees have executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases, making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers.  I just want to take a moment to address the fiscal '25 financial goals we introduced in March. We remain confident in the strategic premise covered in March. However, the current macro backdrop has changed in ways that we and many others were not expecting. As such, we are removing these targets. And we'll share more context on our midterm financial expectations once we begin to experience a more stable operating environment.  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are managing thoughtfully and carefully, while still investing in our future. This includes actively assessing further actions to evolve our operating model, manage profitability and iterate on our growth initiatives. We fundamentally believe that technology is more important than ever in our everyday lives. And as a result of the past few years, consumers have even more technology devices in their homes that will need to be updated, upgraded and supported over time. As our vendor partners continue to innovate and the world becomes increasingly more digital in all aspects, we will be there to uniquely help customers in our stores, online, virtually and directly in their homes. This company has navigated monumental change, riding incredible highs and managing difficult lows since our founding 56 years ago. As we have done throughout our history, we will use this moment to lead and double down on our purpose, making it clear that we continue to uniquely support customers in ways literally no one else can.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for additional details on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Yes. I mean there's -- there are categories where the price points and decisions around the type of product matter. Large TVs is the example we use. There are other categories like let's take mobile phones where it's not as much a decision between trading up or trading down. You want a certain brand. You want a certain type of phone. And so -- or even some of what we're seeing in gaming, where as much of the kind of gaming hardware as we can get our hands on, the consumer is looking to purchase. So that's why it isn't perfectly even throughout the categories in our business, in particular, because sometimes, you're very brand-specific. And then sometimes, you're more brand-agnostic and you're just looking for the right experience. I wouldn't say it's become phenomenally easier to exactly see around the corner. Simeon, I give our teams a great deal of credit for working hard to catch trends quickly. I think what makes the current environment the most volatile that I've seen is the quantity of inventory at other retailers and the promotional activity correspondingly the markdowns with some of those heavier inventory levels. I think that's the part that right now makes the business a little more volatile. I think as some of those inventory levels normalize a little bit more, then I do think you're perhaps in a more normalized environment. And Matt even hit on it when he was talking about the Q4 EBIT rate. You start to lap some of those promos that we actually started to see in consumer electronics a more promotional environment in Q4 of last year.  So I think as you work through the back half of this year, Simeon, my point of view is it starts to stabilize a little bit. But I hedge that just because there's so much inventory that's in the marketplace right now, A; and B, it is still a really volatile macro environment. And I think you've got a very uneven consumer who is making corresponding choices depending on how long inflation lasts, and like I said in my prepared remarks, especially in those core categories like food, rent, housing. So I'd love to say it's perfectly stabilizing, and we can predict it, but I still think you have a lot of factors at play that are influencing consumer behavior. So 2 pieces. One, right now, I believe the impact is mainly promotionality, because you've had really a sustained period here of a couple of years where it was disproportionately low promotionality because there was such high demand and such low inventory levels. And so right now, it really is a function of those promotions coming back.  To your second point, this is a really important part of the thesis and what I think is important about Best Buy. Our vendors who are sure are going to continue to innovate, looking for that kind of next cool product, that will continue to drive demand. And so I think my hypothesis is, it's been a little harder to have all your innovation engines flexing here in the last 2 years when you're trying so hard to produce at the levels that we've needed. So every ounce of energy has kind of been focused on production. And I think that in the future here, as especially these inventory levels normalize, I think you've got a number of vendors who are really interested in.  Now that you have this much larger installed base of connected devices in people's homes, they're also going to be very interested in how do you upgrade those devices, how do you connect those devices, how do you help a customer live in their homes, which still increasingly people are spending more time in. So I think that's the next phase, Simeon, that I believe we'll see from here, which is more of that innovation engine. And it's always been true in CE. And the hardest part is I cannot always tell you exactly what the next innovation is going to be. But we definitely know that behind the scenes, you continue to see innovations in spaces like what you just talked about hearing, in spaces like computing, with hybrid work models clearly becoming the future and some of the replacement cycles there even speeding up a bit. So I think that will be the next level. But for right now, you're really just kind of course correcting for 2 years that were very, very low in terms of promotionality. Yes. Thanks, Anthony. For us, the back-to-school sales are actually slightly ahead of our, what I'll call, kind of tempered expectations. And it's following a trend that was really more pertinent prior to the pandemic, which is people were shopping later and later. And not super surprising given that this is a very different school year than we've seen for the past 2 years. And you probably got parents and kids who are just kind of really trying to figure out, how do I gear up for a year that at least is starting out much more in person and especially at the collegiate level much more on-campus. So if anything, it's been a little bit better than we had thought and it's following that same trajectory. In terms of implications for the holiday, I think it's less about what does back-to-school portend. I think it's more about kind of broadly what we're seeing. So we mentioned we're seeing a customer who's more value-oriented, who is definitely moving more towards some of those sale events. And so I think our hypothesis is you're going to see a holiday that starts to look a little bit more like what we saw pre-pandemic. Maybe comes a little bit later, it's probably promotional in our space. That's part of what is embedded in the guide that Matt talked about.  And I think it's going to be, my personal point of view, a little harder to pull those sales into October when there's not -- remember, for 2 years, in October, we were yelling at the consumer, make sure that you get your inventory because there isn't enough. Obviously, the backdrop looks a little different there. And so I think you might have a consumer who's willing to wait, look for the deals and really look for those great values. And again, like I said, I'm not sure back-to-school is the indicator of that. I think that's just more broadly what we're seeing in the macro and in the consumer. Maybe I'll start and then Matt can add on. I think we are watching both sides of the equation carefully, both the kind of ASP side of things and also the unit side of things. Broadly, on the whole, we're seeing a stabilization of ASPs year-over-year. And so you can imply in that, obviously, you're seeing a bit of unit decline. And I think what's interesting right now is you've still got a consumer who is spending on the whole quite a bit. I think they're being choosier, and it's uneven as to where they're spending. And so I think it makes it a little hard to answer the question exactly how much is pulled forward because you're against a very different backdrop than you were even 6 months ago.  I think what is -- again, and I'll go back to it, what for us is most compelling is that no matter what, you have a massively higher installed base that is in people's homes and people are spending more time in their homes than ever. And in a category like computing, we can already see that some of those upgrade cycles are happening a little bit faster than they were before. So that would imply, more than anything, it was more incremental purchases, and then you'll see that upgrade over time. And again, I mean, now it's been 2.5 years since some of the original computing devices were purchased at the very beginning of the pandemic. So you're going to have some compelling use case changes here over the next year or 2.  So it's a long way of saying, I think it's difficult against the current macro backdrop to make a precise indication of how many units were pulled forward and how much was incremental. I think instead, we remain focused on making sure we have the right inventory there for our customers and being ready as they're more ready to upgrade their devices. The only thing I would add is that, and I said in the prepared remarks, but it bears repeating, strategically, what we laid out, we still have incredible confidence in. And that's why we want to make sure we're getting updates on some of those strategic investments that we're making. I think the baseline of where we're starting from, to Matt's point, is quite different than what we originally assumed. So we chatted a bit in the prepared remarks and said we still like what we were seeing in terms of -- for right now, and again, we haven't even lapped a year, in terms of the engagement and the spend of the existing cohort of Totaltech support members. We also said, just like you would with any membership program, we are going to keep looking at the benefits that are included, what customers value, what keeps customers sticky to Best Buy, and we will continue to iterate on the offer. So I don't think it's as simple as a light switch, like is it on or is it off? I think there's a lot about the offer and behaviors that we're seeing that is really compelling.  And at the same time, we want to make sure that the offer is used and is engaging for customers and is over time keeping them sticky to the brand. And we said it in the remarks, it is difficult because frequency is lower in our category, so it takes us more time, especially against the macro backdrop that has changed as dramatically as this one has. It's going to take us more time to assess. Over the long term, is this doing what we want it to do? And so for right now, we like what we're seeing in the cohort of customers. It's still early. It's against an uneven backdrop. And we're going to continue to iterate on the offer to make sure, at the end of the day, what's most important is that it keeps customers engaged with the brand. Yes. We hit on this a little bit earlier, Brian. But I do think our manufacturing partners have been doing everything they can to produce as much product as possible over the last 2 years. So kind of writ large, if you think about the industry broadly. And a hypothesis would be that does make it a little bit more difficult to innovate at the pace that you would like because you're just working so hard to produce what you need to for the demand that's in front of you.  And so I think as hopefully, you start to see a more -- a little bit more normalized demand environment, that absolutely -- I can't imagine a world where the manufacturers that we work with aren't working morning, noon and night to try to think through how to innovate on the products that we have today to drive more of that replacement, more of that consumption going forward. And so I don't have an exact measurement to tell you how much are they innovating last year versus next year. But I absolutely fundamentally believe, you've got a manufacturer set that is looking to capitalize on an increasingly digital consumer who is more and more willing to use these products in their home. I think the key here is that the goal of the program is ultimately to create an offer that has further reach and has a broad appeal. And that, over time, we drive frequency and greater share of wallet with our customers. Obviously, that's going to take time. And to Matt's point, it's not that it's any more impactful. Actually, as we start to get scale, it is helpful on the Total business because you are in theory growing that frequency and growing that share of wallet. It just takes us time to get there. Mike, the last thing that I would add on the inventory question is, it is a -- I'm very proud of the work that the teams have done. I'm proud to head into holiday in a good healthy inventory position. And we said it in the prepared remarks, that allows us a little bit more space to invest in those places where we think there really will be consumer demand. So I think it is a really good situation to be in.  And with that, I think yours was the last question. Thank you all so much for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our results and our progress during our next call in November."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team\u2019s strong execution and focus on providing amazing service for our customers. Throughout the quarter, they navigated the uncertain macro environment and drove higher customer satisfaction scores while keeping energy and excitement going around the initiatives that we believe will drive longer term opportunities. We grew our Totaltech membership, increased momentum in our health business, launched new product categories and reached our fastest ever Q1 average online sales delivery speed. At our investor update in March, we said we expected our fiscal \u201823 financial results to look different. As we all lap stimulus and other government support, our industry cycles the last 2 years of unusually strong demand and we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. In addition, we said we expected promotional activity to increase and supply chain expenses to be a pressure. As such, we guided our annual comparable sales to decline 1% to 4% and our non-GAAP operating income rate to decline 60 basis points to approximately 5.4%. Therefore, the drivers of our Q1 financial results were largely as expected. Macro conditions worsened since we provided our guidance in early March, including higher inflation and the war in Ukraine, which resulted in our sales being slightly lower than our expectations and supply chain costs a little higher than we planned. Our investment in Totaltech at approximately 100 basis points of gross margin pressure was in line with our expectations and revenue from our credit card profit share was higher than anticipated. Overall, I am proud of our team\u2019s ability to develop and execute plans to adapt to the changing environment over the past 2 years and to the more recent macroeconomic conditions. Our revenue and profitability remained much stronger than they were pre-pandemic. Q1 revenue of $10.6 billion is $1.5 billion or 16% higher than Q1 of pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. And while our non-GAAP operating income rate is currently being impacted by our investments, it is still 80 basis points higher than fiscal \u201820 even with those investments and supply chain pressures. Our enterprise comparable sales declined 8% as we lapped particularly strong comparable sales last year. The 37% comp sales growth in Q1 of last year was driven by the timing of government stimulus payments, lapping a quarter during which our stores were closed early in the pandemic and the heightened demand for stay-at-home focused purchases. From a category standpoint, the biggest contributor to the comp sales decline, were computing and home theater. Although down from last year\u2019s strong sales compared to Q1 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue has grown more than 30%. Our domestic appliance business, which has grown every quarter, except for 1 for more than 10 years, delivered comparable sales growth of 3% on top of 67% growth last year. We aspire to help customers with all their technology needs in the most seamlessly possible across all touch points and we are encouraged by the improvements in our customer net promoter scores. We have been leveraging our omnichannel strength to serve and support our customers as their shopping behavior and expectations have evolved significantly over the past 2 years. While customers have returned to physical stores to see and touch products and get advice, our digital engagement with customers remains very high. Our online sales as a percentage of domestic sales are 31%, still twice as high as pre-pandemic levels and revenue from virtual phone and chat interactions continues to increase rapidly. Additionally, we are expanding our engagement with customers in their homes as in-home consultations and in-home installations are up significantly. During the quarter, we saw higher NPS overall and we saw our highest ever NPS from in-store purchases and in-store services. I would like to take a moment to expand on the topic of inflation, important in the current environment. Like other companies, we have seen cost inflation in areas such as labor, marketing and supply chain. However, this cost inflation was largely in line with our expectations and benefited from planning and execution over the previous 2 years. As it relates to product pricing, we have seen an increase in our average selling prices over the past 2 years due to a number of factors. First, our product sales mix has changed as customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. This has been happening for years and accelerated during the pandemic. Additionally, we have driven material growth in appliances, which carry high ASPs and have become a larger part of our mix. Second, there was overall lower promotional and markdown activity during much of the pandemic due to the shortage of product to meet demand. And third, our vendors are absorbing higher transportation and component costs and some of that has led to higher cost of goods sold for us. In many cases, we have passed through this higher cost of goods sold in the form of higher prices to customers. Importantly and fundamentally, we aim to be competitive in our pricing. We have seen a pickup in the promotional environment, as we have consistently noted, starting in July of last year. As we entered fiscal \u201823, we expected the promotional environment to create margin pressure in Q1 and throughout the year. In Q1, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. And some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre-pandemic levels. Turning back to our Q1 results, our ending inventory was up 9% compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenue since fiscal \u201820. Our teams did an amazing job actively managing inventory levels as the quarter progressed in this evolving supply and demand environment. Pockets of inventory constraints still exist, but are currently isolated to certain products and vendors. Overall, our inventory remains healthy. Even though inventory availability in CE is much better than it has been for much of the pandemic, the supply chain continues to be challenging with ongoing transportation disruptions and higher costs including containers, labor and fuel. We are, of course, not immune to the supply chain challenges in the world today and we are seeing some impacts on our business. We have invested in many aspects of our supply chain over the last several years in ways that have helped us navigate the environment and mitigate the impacts. We have employed a portfolio approach as it relates to carriers, transportation partners and parcel delivery partners. And we have built deep relationships across our supply chain, including port carriers and deconsolidation operations. In addition, we strategically leveraged the use of both rail and over-the-road transportation modes to move product. All of this has helped us to drive capacity, avoid large-scale disruption and mitigate cost increases. Importantly, our contractual relationships have allowed us to limit our exposure to the more turbulent spot market. The strong relationships we have cultivated with our vendors have also been crucial to our navigation of the supply chain environment. Working closely with our vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. Additionally, we actually handled transportation for many of our vendors, meaning we take control in Asia or Mexico. Then we have full visibility and control of the inventory movement and costs. We have invested in our distribution center network, effectively bringing product closer to customers and implementing technology solutions that increase productivity and speed to customer. We have also invested in our store-based fulfillment, including our ship-from-store customer fulfillment centers and implemented an effective employee delivery system. These investments have allowed us to make dramatic improvements in speed of delivery to our customers, even with the significant increase in volume in the past 2 plus years. In addition, we have many options for our customers to pickup their products themselves through in-store pickup, curbside pickup, lockers and alternate pickup locations. Customers clearly appreciate the convenience as the percentage of online sales picked up in stores has remained relatively consistent over the past several years at approximately 40%, even with the incredible improvements in shipping time. As it relates to ESG, we remain encouraged by the recent recognition of our work to support the environment and our community, both inside and outside Best Buy. We are proud to be included on Ethisphere\u2019s 2022 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies list. We are one of only three retailers on it and it\u2019s our eighth time earning the honor. We were also included on the 2022 Forbes List of Best Employers for Diversity as one of the top four retailers on the list. It\u2019s our third consecutive year making the rankings that recognize leadership and commitment towards building a more inclusive workplace. During the quarter, we expanded our recycling program to include a new service for customers who are looking for our help recycling their large products. For a fee, we will go to customers\u2019 homes to pickup large electronics and appliances as well as an unlimited number of small products and ensure they are responsibly recycled and kept out of landfill. This service is in addition to our everyday recycling programs available at all Best Buy stores and our Holloway service with the purchase of new products. As I mentioned earlier our employees executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers. Even with the expected slowdown this year as we lap 2 plus years of pandemic impacts, we continue to be in a fundamentally stronger position than we expected to be at this point. We are confident in the strength of our business and excited about what lies ahead. We have a compelling value creation opportunity and are investing now as we have successfully invested ahead of change in our past, to ensure we are ready to meet the needs of our customers and retain our unique position in our industry. As we provided a more detailed investor update in combination with our Q4 results on March 3, I am not going to outline all our initiatives, but would like to provide a few updates on our progress. In March, we spoke quite a bit about Totaltech, our unique membership program that includes member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery and installation and 24/7 tech support. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers with complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. During the quarter, we continued to sign up more members as customers realize the great benefits of the program. And we are encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we continue to see from customers who have signed up to become members. We are pleased with the pace at which we are acquiring new members, especially considering the macro environment. We continue to see that Totaltech has broad appeal across customer segments. Additionally, we are improving our ability to gain members not only in retail stores, but in our digital and in-home channels. As a reminder, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer term benefit. We expect year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate to cease as we lapped the launch in October. And over time, we expect the incremental spend we garnered from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. Accordingly, Totaltech is a significant contributor to our fiscal \u201825 goals. As we outlined in March, we are optimizing our workforce and re-imagining our physical presence in ways that serve our customers\u2019 needs in our more digital world. We are making investments that provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as the customer moves from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home. This includes our virtual sales strategy. Early in the pandemic, the volume of customers interacting with us via phone and chat skyrocketed. The volume has remained high and we are actively working to increase the sales opportunity of these interactions through a number of efforts. One, we are leveraging a team of expert sales associates working from their homes, many of whom have in-depth store experience and are certified in multiple categories. Two, we have staffed our virtual store with dedicated experts who can help you via video and demo a product just like they would in our store. And three, we are enhancing the training for our offshore call center agents to help them feel like confident salespeople. We are already seeing great results as revenue from these interactions more than doubled in Q1 compared to last year. Enhancements to our technology platforms are in progress to further streamline our operations and enable these employees to chat, video, text, share their screens and transact. With this, we will be able to accelerate the productivity and sales opportunity further. We have spoken quite a bit about our consultation service that provides customers with expert help and inspiration tailored to their unique tech needs often right in their homes. This is growing and important as we continue to see very high customer satisfaction scores and increasing spend by customers who engage with the consultants. We also have a team that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries, including homebuilding, hospitality and healthcare. We have been growing this aspect of our business for several years and more recent investments in our digital capabilities and fulfillment have led to strong growth momentum that we expect will continue. For example, Q1 revenue from this team was up 15% over last year\u2019s Q1 and up more than 70% from Q1 of fiscal \u201820. As I step back to comment on our overall workforce, we have been actively evolving the composition of our teams throughout the last 2 years as customer behavior changed and became even more digitally focused. The result is that our overall headcount is actually lower than pre-pandemic. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interaction. We will continue to learn, evaluate and evolve the model in light of the way the business and shopping habits are changing. At the same time, we have invested and will continue to invest in flexibility, training, compensation and benefits for our associates. We are incredibly proud that our field turnover rates remain significantly below the retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates. Additionally, our store general manager turnover is just 6%, meaning our GMs have the tenure and experience to effectively help their teams navigate this dynamic environment. It is clear that we have store managers who are invested in their employees, their career paths, their well-being and their communities, and I thank them for their dedication. Of course, as previously noted, we are also re-imagining our physical stores. This year, we expect to complete approximately 45 remodels to implement our experience store concept. We are excited about these remodels as we continue to see higher revenue and NPS in the pilot locations compared to the controlled stores, especially as one of the pilots has been running almost 2 years. We also continue to see strong results from our outlet stores and are on track to rollout more this year with new stores opening soon in Chicago, Houston and Phoenix. Our outlet stores assort open box, clearance, end-of-life and otherwise distressed large product inventory in major appliances and televisions that might otherwise be liquidated at significantly lower recovery rate. We tend to see twice the recovery rate of our cost of goods sold when we sell this product at our outlets versus alternative channels. Additionally, these locations can attract new and reengaged customers. Last year, we estimate that approximately 16% of outlet customers were new to Best Buy and 37% were reengaged Best Buy customers. In fiscal \u201823, we plan to double the number of outlets by opening 15 additional stores, and we are expanding our assortment beyond major appliances and large TVs to include computing, gaming and mobile phones. We are already seeing increased performance in these new outlet formats as customers gravitate to the expanded assortment. Finally, these outlet stores are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in a landfill. And another important element of this circular economy strategy is our trade-in program. We have an extensive trade-in program covering more major CE categories than anyone else. In Q1, we took in 135,000 trade-in units from customers. Not only does our trade-in program keep tech products out of landfills, our customers typically spend 3x the amount they received on their trade-in on new products at Best Buy. We are continuing our category expansion strategy as well. For example, we\u2019re helping customers commute more sustainably with a new lineup of the best electric bike scooters and mopeds. Over the next 18 months, we will be bringing a selection of these products to nearly every Best Buy store. We\u2019re also rolling out charging devices, perfect for our customers\u2019 garages in several stores. And Geek Squad can not only assemble the e-bikes for customers, but we\u2019re also beginning a pilot to test service and repair for e-transportation products in some of our stores. We also just recently announced further expansion into the health and beauty category by launching new skincare technology products online and in 300 of our stores. In our Best Buy Health business, we are pleased with our first quarter momentum. In Q1, we saw strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. In our Emerging Virtual Care business, we connect patients with their physicians to enable care at home. Last November, we acquired Current Health, a technology company with an FDA-cleared monitoring platform for care at home to help us accelerate our strategy. The combination of Current Health offerings and our scale, presence and Geek Squad in-home capabilities is already resonating with the healthcare industry. Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking quarter ever, including expansion of its relationships with health systems such as Mount Sinai Health System, Parkland Health, as well as the UK National Health Service and others. I\u2019m excited to share that Current Health was awarded best hospital technology implementation in the 2022 MedTech Breakthrough Awards program for its role supporting health systems across the U.S. implement innovative care home programs. Current Health was also selected by Frost & Sullivan as the 2022 Company of the Year in the global virtual home care platform industry. In summary, I am proud of how much we accomplished in the first quarter and excited about what lies ahead for us. Clearly, there remains a great deal of uncertainty. On one hand, consumers still have relatively strong balance sheet, they continue to spend, wages are up and unemployment is at record lows. On the other hand, many consumers are lapping stimulus income they received last year and are also facing issues like higher gas and food prices, rising interest in mortgage rates, recession fears, stock market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine. Underlying all that is the gradual shifting of spend from stay-at-home purchases to more experiential spend on services and the activities, many were unable to enjoy during the pandemic. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, while the drivers of our results were largely as expected, the comparable sales decline of 8% was on the softer side as inflationary pressures heightened throughout the quarter. That trend has continued into the beginning of Q2, and it does not appear that it will abate in the near-term. Therefore, as Matt will outline, we are revising our guidance and now expect fiscal \u201823 comparable sales decline in the range of 3% to 6%. And we are correspondingly updating our non-GAAP operating income rate to a range of 5.2% to 5.4%. We will continue to proactively navigate this rapidly changing environment, balancing the day-to-day operations with our commitment to our long-term strategy and growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 and our outlook, I want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers in all our channels. I greatly appreciate your teamwork and perseverance. I love the Best Buy culture and our commitment to enriching lives through technology. And I will close by saying this. We firmly believe that technology is more relevant today than ever. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology, and we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers\u2019 homes right for their lives. From our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn\u2019t working the way you want or traded in recycling when you want to upgrade. We believe we have an ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. As Corie mentioned, we expected our Q1 financial results to be softer on a year-over-year basis. Our Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 8% on a comparable basis as we lapped a very strong 37% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.6% compared to 6.4% last year. If you compare it to the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, before the pandemic, our non-GAAP operating income rate increased 80 basis points. Our revenue growth has clearly played a role in our improved SG&A rate, but I would also like to highlight a few other factors. Our investment in Totaltech membership alone added more than 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to the fiscal \u201820 period. We are also investing in Best Buy Health. These are both areas that we know create near-term pressure, but we believe they will drive compelling financial returns over time as they scale. I also want to note that since fiscal \u201820, our mix of revenue from our online channel has more than doubled, and we have efficiently evolved our operating model to support this shift in consumer shopping behavior, while at the same time, navigating higher wages and increase supply chain and technology costs. Let me now share more details on the first quarter performance versus last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.7% to $9.9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 8.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, as expected, the largest comparable sales decline was the 5-week fiscal March period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater. In addition, services comparable sales declined 12% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services such as warranty and installation. In our International segment, revenue decreased 5.4% to $753 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of $19 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 1.4% in Canada. Turning now to gross profit. where our enterprise rate declined 120 basis points, 22.1%. The domestic gross profit rate declined 140 basis points, which was primarily driven by lower services margin rates, including pressure associated with Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates, which included increased promotional activity and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue in the company\u2019s private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Lastly, our International non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 130 basis points compared to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our Enterprise results. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. On a weighted basis, the services category negatively impacted the Domestic gross profit rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year, which largely aligned with our expectations entering the quarter. Moving next to SG&A. Our Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $100 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of $130 million, which included lapping $40 million for one-time gratitude and appreciation awards last year. Partially offsetting the lower incentive compensation were increased expenses for advertising and our health initiatives. During the quarter, we returned a total of $654 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $455 million and dividends of $199 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.88 was an increase of 26% and marked the 8th straight year our regular dividend increased at least 10% compared to the prior year. Consistent with our original guidance, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year. Many of the key assumptions driving our outlook from when we enter the year remain unchanged. We still expect the first half of the year to be more pressured on a year-over-year basis for both revenue growth and our non-GAAP operating income rate. In addition, we still expect the non-GAAP operating income rate decline to be primarily come from lower gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the key driver. Let me next share some context on what has changed in our outlook. Entering the year, we were cognizant of lapping the large levels of government stimulus actions last year. As we already shared, sales came in a little lower than our expectations for the first quarter, and this trend has continued into the second quarter. It is difficult to assess how much of the decline may be longer tail associated with elevated stimulus spending last year or overall consumer spending slowing down due to inflationary concerns and the shift of consumer spending to experiences. Based on the trends we are seeing over the past several weeks, we now feel it\u2019s more likely that we will be on the lower end of our original guidance expectations. As a result, we now expect comparable sales to decline 3% to 6%. As Corie discussed, clearly, there is still a lot of uncertainty in macro cross currents. Thus, we will continue to assess the sales trends, adjusting for our spend for variable items like advertising and store labor, as well as discretionary areas as appropriate. We also expect favorable trends in our private label credit card arrangement to partially offset higher costs in areas like supply chain for the remainder of the year. At the same time, we remain committed to progressing the initiatives we are confident will deliver compelling financial returns in the future. As a result of the lower sales outlook, our non-GAAP operating income rate outlook is now 5.2% to 5.4%. Based on these factors, I\u2019ve just outlined, our guidance for the full year now represents the following: Enterprise revenue of $48.3 billion to $49.9 billion, a comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.2% to 5.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.40 to $9. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. And lastly, we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion. As we shared on our last earnings call, we no longer plan to provide quarterly guidance going forward. However, we\u2019d like to provide context on our expectations. Several of the key themes from the first quarter are expected to be consistent in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales and the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will both be very similar to our first quarter results. Also, as a reminder, last year\u2019s second quarter included a one-time diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.47 from a lower effective tax rate. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question today from Zachary Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much. It\u2019s actually [indiscernible] pitching for Zach here. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question. Maybe could you sort of recast your FY \u201825 assumptions in the context of today\u2019s updated guidance? Obviously, some of these macro headwinds you called out are maybe likely to be temporal. That said, does it put more pressure on your business to deliver in FY \u201824 and FY \u201825? And how should we be thinking about those 2% to 4% out year comps in that 6.3% to 6.8% operating margin target in that context?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. Thank you for the question. Obviously, I think it\u2019s way too early for us to be updating our FY \u201825 goals at this point. You\u2019re right. I mean I think the lowering of the range this year does create a bit of a different picture. But at the same time, we very much believe in the strength of our industry and are very encouraged by the initiatives that we have, that we outlined at the Investor Day, Totaltech, and expanded assortment in our health initiatives. Those all remain the same. And if anything, we\u2019re even more excited about those as we look forward. So obviously, the ranges we gave this year, they are pretty wide. And the ranges for FY \u201825 is still pretty wide. So there is a number of outcomes we already had contemplated in setting those goals back in March. So we still remain pretty confident in those numbers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. No, that\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe pivoting a little bit here to appliances, obviously, it\u2019s great to see you guys still delivering positive comps here, especially given what you were up against last year. Kind of maybe you want to talk to the sustainability of the positive comps in the appliance segment, especially as we really kind of continue to lap some of that stimulus and maybe face some of these macro pressures. Thanks so much.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I think this appliances has been a place where we\u2019ve been sustaining growth for a long time, what\u2019s been growing every quarter for 10 years, except for one when we closed our stores. So we are very confident in our team\u2019s ability to continue to drive sales up. Clearly, there are some very elevated levels of comp that were coming over the last couple of years of spend. But the team continues to drive the assortment and the experience changes that make it a very meaningful place to buy appliances. And that includes both the majors and the small side. So we remain really excited and confident about the prospects there. For the 5th straight year, we see the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among appliance retailers. So the team is getting the right experience that I think will help us drive sales higher as we look into the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Really appreciate it.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We take our next question from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you and good morning. Corie, I wanted to focus on Totaltech, and I appreciate the color, but I was hoping if you can provide us a little more details around how membership is framing relative to expectations, maybe in the context of churn and/or retention? And then just a broader comment on what part of the value proposition do you think is resonating most with your customer in the current sort of environment?\nCorie Barry: Yes. So I\u2019m just going to start by taking a little bit of a step back here. Obviously, what we\u2019re aiming to do here is take our deep knowledge of the customer, combined with our history of a multitude of membership programs and our unique abilities to create a very unique paid membership offer with very broad reach. That broad appeal means we see more different types of demographics that this appeals to. And by the way, it is also more comfortable to sell because our associates just have a lot of passion around the multitude of offers. To specifically your question about what\u2019s resonating, the truth is all aspects are resonating, but different pieces seem to resonate with different demographics. Certainly, the included warranty aspects, especially the Apple Care resonates with some of our younger demographics. The pricing and discounts actually resonates across all and then the support we see resonate with some of our older demographics. So the point here is actually this broad reach of a multitude of pieces of the offer that will actually appeal to many. The purpose, as we said, is to drive frequency and share of wallet over time. The reason we\u2019re not updating right now is we are just starting to lap our beta test from last year. If you remember, we actually launched in April with the full rollout in October. And so we are literally just getting a feel now for what retention looks like. It remains in line with \u2013 as we\u2019ve converted customers remains in line with what we had expected. But right now, we\u2019re just \u2013 we want to actually start to lap some of those new customers who actually opted into the program before we comment too much on retention. What I will say is, look, the goal here is to create a moat around the consumer and to make it kind of inconceivable for them to buy CE anywhere else. And we know we\u2019re growing our share of wallet with those that are shopping us. So we know it\u2019s doing what we want it to do, but we\u2019re using this time period to continue to learn and iterate on the acquisition, the usage that we\u2019re seeing right now and then ultimately those retention figures.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. I\u2019ll keep it to one. Best of luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Joe Feldman of Telsey has our next question. Please go ahead.\nJoe Feldman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Back on the promotions, you mentioned some products are starting to get more promotional. And I guess I was just wondering which areas you are seeing more of that pressure and your view of promotions? Maybe the balance of this year, will it accelerate or do you think it will just be kind of normalized relative to a year ago? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Thanks Joe. As we outlined back in March, we expected to see promotions be pressured this year compared to last year. And we also commented that we \u2013 that eventually, they would return to closer to FY \u201820 levels at some point. As we have got into the quarter, we actually started to seeing a little bit more pressure on the promotion side than we expected. Again, that was offset by a little bit of credit \u2013 better credit card profit share from the arrangement we have. But we did see a little bit more promotionality. And I think it\u2019s pretty broad across most of our categories. We are starting to increase in terms of the amount of discount and the mix on promotion. TVs was a place where we did see more promotions on a year-over-year basis. Computing has been starting more promotional all the way back to July of last year. So, that continued as well. So, those are the areas I would probably highlight, but there are also even just some very iconic type of products to in specific categories that are very promotional, even though in some cases inventory is constrained. And so overall, we know it\u2019s returning as we expected it would. It isn\u2019t quite back to FY \u201820 levels, but it is heading in the same \u2013 heading to that path as we expected.\nJoe Feldman: That\u2019s great. Thank you. And I will also keep it to one and good luck this quarter.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: We will move now to Mike Baker of Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMike Baker: Hi. Thanks guys. A couple of related questions. One, you said March was the worst part of the quarter. So, can you talk a little bit about April? It sounds like you said the weakness is continuing, but a little bit more detail there. And then related to that, it looks like \u2013 and this is similar to your previous guidance, but the back half is much better in terms of year-over-year changes versus the implied front half. What gives you that confidence? Is it simply just different comparisons, or why are we expecting a significantly better back half? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure, yes. So, we are not going to comment on specific months, but March was the biggest decline in Q1. And as the sales pressure continued as we exited Q1 \u2013 actually, it was a little more pressure than on sales than we expected. If you remember last year, too, as we got into the second quarter, we talked about how we were still doing about a 30% comp in the first few weeks of May. So, we are still lapping those stimulus payments that kind of came in starting in March of last year. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the lion\u2019s share of that sales decline. As you think about the back half of the year, I mean there is a number of things. We believe as you get to the back half, most of that stimulus impact, a lot of it will have left in terms of a comparison. We also know, as we look to the back half of the year, we do expect product availability and certain products and categories to improve compared to the first part of this year and also if you look at compared to last year, in Q4, there was some notable product shortages in iconic areas that we talked about not getting, that did have an impact on sales. We also, in Q4, shortened our store hours in January as we were lapping some of the Omicron variant impacts. And then lastly, I comment is we do expect our initiatives to start to continue to drive more impact to our sales outlook as you get further down into the trajectory of those ramps. So, those are the reasons I would highlight.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we will move to Karen Short of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. I actually just wanted to push a little harder and follow-up on the 2025 guide with respect to where you are at today? And obviously, as you were just asked, you did elaborate a little bit on what the second half and why the second half will look better. But maybe a little more color on why you feel confident in the 2025 guide, about 6.3 to 6.8 in light of the fact that, obviously, 2Q will be much weaker than expected. And then just on that same note, are you factoring in a recessionary environment with respect to your guidance for the year and with respect to your 2025 guide?\nCorie Barry: Yes. So, I will start with the fiscal \u201825 guidance. I am going to reiterate what Matt said. It is still really early in the long-range guide that we gave. And there are many moving parts and pieces as I outlined in some of the prepared comments. And so we remain confident in the initiatives and the roadmap that we have put together to deliver that \u201825 guide. And as Matt said, it\u2019s a pretty wide range. So, what we are going to use this year to do is to continue to understand how those initiatives develop, how this year plays out, obviously, and then how the implications for all of that in that longer term guide. But I think it warrants giving it some time to see how the year is going to play. Specific to your point about recession, I want to take one step back here for a second. I think I want to start with a reminder that this is a very stable industry. Consumer electronics, over time, is a stable industry. And the last 2 years have clearly underscored the importance of tech in people\u2019s lives. So, I think it\u2019s important for us to have that as a backdrop and the fact that we were obviously already planning for our industry to decline this year, and then we have adjusted based on what we are seeing in the recent results. It\u2019s fair to say that we are factoring in elements of softer demand, but we are not planning for a full recession or guide. We will not assume a full recession at this point. Obviously, if that were the case, we will continue to update the performance and the expectations. But I think I would characterize our guide more as a softer environment, not a full recession.\nMatt Bilunas: And I might just add, I think also, I think you made a question around the rate guide as well. I think as you think about the rate this year, we are actually not too far off from our original guidance expectations for this year from 5.2 to 5.4, just acknowledging a little bit of softer on the sales side. But all of the structural things that are included in that expectation are kind of coming in as we expect. It\u2019s nothing that\u2019s too dissimilar at this point. And we have already built those into what we see this year and what we see in the out years to be confident in addition to sales, but also being able to achieve some of those rate expectations for FY \u201825.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities has our next question.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good morning. I would like to follow-up on the promotional environment. If you could give us some sense as to what you are planning for in terms of promotions this year relative to pre-pandemic levels? And how much is embedded in terms of gross margin pressure relative to your prior guide, that would be helpful.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. So, I would say it\u2019s fair to say we expect, like I said earlier, that promotions returned closer and closer to FY \u201820. Throughout this year, exactly when that happens, we are not commenting on, but we would expect it to increase as the year progresses. Importantly, as you look to the back half of this year, though we are starting to lap where promotions increased last year, starting in July in computing. So, we have baked into our plans a slow increase of promotionality in most categories as you get towards the back half of this year. Exactly where that lands exactly at FY \u201820, we are \u2013 it\u2019s hard to exactly say, but we have baked that into the plans.\nCorie Barry: And I think it\u2019s worth noting, and I know all of you know this, but just to reiterate. Obviously, promotions are not just a function of Best Buy. They are a function of relationships with our vendors as well. We are interested in ensuring that their newest and greatest products are out there for the world to see and priced appropriately. So, this is not just a function of Best Buy promotionality. It\u2019s a function of the overall industry promotionality in partnership with our vendors.\nSeth Basham: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move to Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, a lot of our clients are focused on the ability of companies to flex expenses in an environment of slowing demand potentially persisting. Could you just update us on the fixed and variable split in your P&L and priorities for reduced discretionary spend if the backdrop does worsen? Thanks so much.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Yes. So, as we started the year, we \u2013 even the guide that we gave at 5.4% on a range of sales outcomes, we \u2013 there is a level of implied already trying to understand the levers you do to keep within the 5.4% rate in terms of the original guidance. So, it\u2019s something that we do as a normal course of business as we see sales slide up or slide down from our expectations. There are a number of areas where you can \u2013 that simply happen because they are variable to like check lane tender, but you also start to adjust areas like marketing or store labor associated with the lower volumes if it does happen. So, those are the variable things that we look at to adjust to as the sales trends change. In addition to that, there are even some more discretionary areas that you can start to look at in addition to variable items. But in some cases \u2013 or even additional marketing to the extent that you are comfortable or even simple areas like travel or adjusting your capital spend, which can adjust depreciation depending on when you do that during a year. So, there are variable and then more discretionary. And as Corie noted, we are not really planning for a recession this year. To the extent that we did, there is obviously more fixed cost areas you can look at if business trends down even more. Right now, we are not planning for that. You can imagine if that had happened, we would look at some of those areas as well. But we would \u2013 in any event, we are trying to hold dear to us strategic investments that we are making, that provide that long-term growth to get to our FY \u201825 goal. So, that\u2019s the last place that we will look at reducing as we look to this year in terms of how we see it now.\nCorie Barry: I do think it\u2019s fair to say the team has obviously navigated this softening environment quite well up to this point. And obviously, the factors that we use, as we are trying to adjust to that softer demand, obviously overlap with the considerations that you would take into account if you are managing for a recession. So, you can imagine behind the scenes, you are running through a bunch of scenarios. And I think the team has done a nice job flexing with a rapidly changing environment and it\u2019s that same type of kind of mindset and considerations you would take if that were to flex down even further.\nJonathan Matuszewski: It makes sense. Thanks guys. Best of luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will move to Brad Thomas of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nBrad Thomas: Hi. Good morning. Just want to ask about inventory a bit. Corie, I think you characterize inventory as being overall healthy. But just wondering if you could put that into a little more context, talk about some of the levers you may be able to pull if the consumer continues to weaken here? And then maybe if you could just help us think a little bit more about how much inventory levels were up just because of inflation and ASPs? Thanks so much.\nCorie Barry: Yes. First, just some gratitude to the team who has really done amazing work, carefully managing our inventory levels and then importantly, leveraging some of the investments that we have made in our supply chain. Some context is helpful here. Our inventory balance was unusually low last year. So again, if you remember how much demand there was in the marketplace at 37% comp, we had an unusually low balance last year. And that inventory balance right now is almost perfectly in line with the sales growth versus pre-pandemic. So, if you went back to kind of normalized pre-pandemic, now, sales growth and inventory growth are almost perfectly in line. And I think that\u2019s a true testament to our vendor partnerships and proactively managing those levels in line with what we have been seeing. Behind the theme, as you can imagine, actually, units in some of the key categories are down as we have seen ASP shifting from the variety of factors that I noted, whether it\u2019s premium and the mix shift in our business or inflation. So, that\u2019s even what underscores the confidence that I have in the statement around our inventory being healthy, feeling very much like it\u2019s in the right place. I think it is important to note, there is still some spotty constraints in very isolated areas for specific vendors and some of the more iconic SKUs that Matt mentioned. But over-archingly, we feel very strongly that we are in a good inventory position, and that\u2019s very much in line with how we have managed inventory historically.\nBrad Thomas: That\u2019s great, Corie. And any context on how much inflation has your inventory up and \u2013 thank you so much.\nCorie Barry: Yes. We haven\u2019t sized it specifically as I kind of alluded to the fact. It\u2019s really hard because back to when about the different pieces that are driving our ASPs up, du have got mix shifts in the business. As people have skewed more premium, you have got more appliances, which tends to skew to higher ASPs. You have got over-archingly, over the last couple of years, fewer markdowns, less promotions, and then you also have inflation. So, all of those pieces add into the ASP increases we have been seeing. That\u2019s why the color I am trying to give is we have actually seen in many of the key categories at the unit levels of our inventory are actually down versus some of the pre-pandemic comparisons and a lot of that is being driven by this kind of confluence of ASP increase.\nBrad Thomas: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks Corie.\nCorie Barry: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Security has our next question. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning guys. Scott Ciccarelli. So, Corie, we have heard that several other retailers that had a pretty tough March and April have indicated that sales have started to improve in May. But your comments on 2Q would suggest you really haven\u2019t seen that. So, I guess my question is, why do you think your business hasn\u2019t necessarily seen the kind of recovery we have seen in some other retail verticals? And related to that, would your cadence comments be any different if we are looking at stock trends? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: I will start and then Matt can clean up anything that I miss. But you have to also look back to last year, and Matt alluded to this. We have that really high sustained growth into May, like we posted the 37% comp in Q1, and then that sustained 30s into May. So, we were we \u2013 unlike some others, we are lapping very sustained high growth, both stimulus related, stay at home related from last year, which is a different cadence. I also think you have heard other retailers comment on the weather and some of the \u2013 and that\u2019s not going to impact our business nearly as much as others. So, I think from a \u2013 like when we \u2013 you almost have to go back to kind of a 3-year look at the business, it\u2019s relatively consistent and actually pretty strong as we are heading into Q2 on that 3-year stack.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Moving now to Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Please go ahead.\nScott Mushkin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I want to get back to profitability a little bit. And the question is basically if, and I know it\u2019s a big if, sales or revenues would fall back to where they were pre-pandemic. Do you guys believe the business even with that is structurally more profitable? And if so, why would you believe that? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, I think we believe that it is structurally more profitable than it was pre-pandemic. As you think about some of the actions and work we have done over the last 2 years to adjust our model with the very heavy shift to digital sales almost doubling from pre-pandemic. We have taken appropriate action to understand the cost structures whether they are to support digital or in our stores or just to support a different type of customer fulfillment need. We have taken the right actions over that period of time to adjust our model \u2013 our cost model to understand \u2013 to account for the changing sales and margin structure \u2013 our gross margin structure. So, we fundamentally do believe that that\u2019s in how we actually decide to fulfill product to customers. That\u2019s on how many associates we have in our stores. It\u2019s a number of things that we have thoughtfully looked at over the last couple of years to change the structure of cost between gross margin rate and SG&A. So, we do believe that fundamentally, in Q1, we were up 80 basis points compared to Q1 pre-pandemic, and that is to account for even though we do have investments like Totaltech at 100 basis points in Q1 and have a doubling of the e-com business, which is a higher parcel cost, we are still getting SG&A leverage considerably better over in Q1 to offset some of those gross margin investments that we are actually making in our business. So, we fundamentally do believe that the structure of our business is finally more profitable. And that\u2019s also underlying in our commitment, our goal is to get to the FY \u201820 goals of 6.3% to 6.8%.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks. That was great, Matt. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We will move next to Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPeter Keith: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. One area I was hoping you could address was the Best Buy ads initiative. My understanding was that should be accretive to gross margin. And obviously, there seems to be some change or evolution of the ad spending backdrop. So, maybe address any changes to the outlook of that program. And separately, just sticking on gross margin, Matt, should that 100 basis points of Totaltech pressure that you saw in Q1, should that continue with Q2?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I will start with the Totaltech pressure. As you look towards the back half of the year, we started to lap the launch of Totaltech. So, we expect the Q2 drivers to be similar to Q1. That would include Totaltech pressure of around 100 basis points. But as you look to Q3 and Q4, we begin to lap it. We launched Totaltech in October of last year, so we don\u2019t lap until the end of this Q3. So, there is still a little pressure from Totaltech in Q3. Then by Q4, the pressure on a year-over-year basis essentially goes down to zero, if you will, because we have lapped the launch of it. So, that\u2019s how the cadence of Totaltech pressure goes.\nCorie Barry: And just a quick reminder on the ads business. Obviously, this is us selling advertising to brands that want to reach our customers, both on our own channels and then on some external sites. I think what\u2019s important here is that our leadership in CE retail remains very, very valuable, high customer traffic and engagement. And it\u2019s that first-party data that we have, which can allow our advertisers to reach really unique audiences. Because we see people all along their purchase journey, which means you can target them at various points in the purchase journey. We haven\u2019t shared specific financial details, but we did see growth in the ads business in Q1, not material enough to highlight for the quarter, but even entering the year. We knew this would be a favorable contributor to the gross profit rate, but a little bit more weighted towards the second half of the year as this ramp continues. And then obviously, this is something that provides that ongoing growth and incremental profitability over time that gives us confidence in those longer term targets.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Thank you very much.\nCorie Barry: Thank you, Peter. And with that, I want to thank you all for joining us today. I hope that many of our investors who are listening today will be able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 9th. Thanks everyone and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. As Corie mentioned, we expected our Q1 financial results to be softer on a year-over-year basis. Our Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 8% on a comparable basis as we lapped a very strong 37% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.6% compared to 6.4% last year. If you compare it to the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, before the pandemic, our non-GAAP operating income rate increased 80 basis points. Our revenue growth has clearly played a role in our improved SG&A rate, but I would also like to highlight a few other factors. Our investment in Totaltech membership alone added more than 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to the fiscal \u201820 period. We are also investing in Best Buy Health. These are both areas that we know create near-term pressure, but we believe they will drive compelling financial returns over time as they scale. I also want to note that since fiscal \u201820, our mix of revenue from our online channel has more than doubled, and we have efficiently evolved our operating model to support this shift in consumer shopping behavior, while at the same time, navigating higher wages and increase supply chain and technology costs. Let me now share more details on the first quarter performance versus last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.7% to $9.9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 8.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, as expected, the largest comparable sales decline was the 5-week fiscal March period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater. In addition, services comparable sales declined 12% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services such as warranty and installation. In our International segment, revenue decreased 5.4% to $753 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of $19 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 1.4% in Canada. Turning now to gross profit. where our enterprise rate declined 120 basis points, 22.1%. The domestic gross profit rate declined 140 basis points, which was primarily driven by lower services margin rates, including pressure associated with Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates, which included increased promotional activity and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue in the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Lastly, our International non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 130 basis points compared to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our Enterprise results. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. On a weighted basis, the services category negatively impacted the Domestic gross profit rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year, which largely aligned with our expectations entering the quarter. Moving next to SG&A. Our Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $100 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of $130 million, which included lapping $40 million for one-time gratitude and appreciation awards last year. Partially offsetting the lower incentive compensation were increased expenses for advertising and our health initiatives. During the quarter, we returned a total of $654 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $455 million and dividends of $199 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.88 was an increase of 26% and marked the 8th straight year our regular dividend increased at least 10% compared to the prior year. Consistent with our original guidance, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year. Many of the key assumptions driving our outlook from when we enter the year remain unchanged. We still expect the first half of the year to be more pressured on a year-over-year basis for both revenue growth and our non-GAAP operating income rate. In addition, we still expect the non-GAAP operating income rate decline to be primarily come from lower gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the key driver. Let me next share some context on what has changed in our outlook. Entering the year, we were cognizant of lapping the large levels of government stimulus actions last year. As we already shared, sales came in a little lower than our expectations for the first quarter, and this trend has continued into the second quarter. It is difficult to assess how much of the decline may be longer tail associated with elevated stimulus spending last year or overall consumer spending slowing down due to inflationary concerns and the shift of consumer spending to experiences. Based on the trends we are seeing over the past several weeks, we now feel it's more likely that we will be on the lower end of our original guidance expectations. As a result, we now expect comparable sales to decline 3% to 6%. As Corie discussed, clearly, there is still a lot of uncertainty in macro cross currents. Thus, we will continue to assess the sales trends, adjusting for our spend for variable items like advertising and store labor, as well as discretionary areas as appropriate. We also expect favorable trends in our private label credit card arrangement to partially offset higher costs in areas like supply chain for the remainder of the year. At the same time, we remain committed to progressing the initiatives we are confident will deliver compelling financial returns in the future. As a result of the lower sales outlook, our non-GAAP operating income rate outlook is now 5.2% to 5.4%. Based on these factors, I've just outlined, our guidance for the full year now represents the following: Enterprise revenue of $48.3 billion to $49.9 billion, a comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.2% to 5.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.40 to $9. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. And lastly, we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion. As we shared on our last earnings call, we no longer plan to provide quarterly guidance going forward. However, we'd like to provide context on our expectations. Several of the key themes from the first quarter are expected to be consistent in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales and the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will both be very similar to our first quarter results. Also, as a reminder, last year's second quarter included a one-time diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.47 from a lower effective tax rate. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Yes. Thank you for the question. Obviously, I think it's way too early for us to be updating our FY \u201825 goals at this point. You're right. I mean I think the lowering of the range this year does create a bit of a different picture. But at the same time, we very much believe in the strength of our industry and are very encouraged by the initiatives that we have, that we outlined at the Investor Day, Totaltech, and expanded assortment in our health initiatives. Those all remain the same. And if anything, we're even more excited about those as we look forward. So obviously, the ranges we gave this year, they are pretty wide. And the ranges for FY \u201825 is still pretty wide. So there is a number of outcomes we already had contemplated in setting those goals back in March. So we still remain pretty confident in those numbers. Yes. I think this appliances has been a place where we've been sustaining growth for a long time, what's been growing every quarter for 10 years, except for one when we closed our stores. So we are very confident in our team's ability to continue to drive sales up. Clearly, there are some very elevated levels of comp that were coming over the last couple of years of spend. But the team continues to drive the assortment and the experience changes that make it a very meaningful place to buy appliances. And that includes both the majors and the small side. So we remain really excited and confident about the prospects there. For the 5th straight year, we see the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among appliance retailers. So the team is getting the right experience that I think will help us drive sales higher as we look into the future. Sure. Thanks Joe. As we outlined back in March, we expected to see promotions be pressured this year compared to last year. And we also commented that we \u2013 that eventually, they would return to closer to FY \u201820 levels at some point. As we have got into the quarter, we actually started to seeing a little bit more pressure on the promotion side than we expected. Again, that was offset by a little bit of credit \u2013 better credit card profit share from the arrangement we have. But we did see a little bit more promotionality. And I think it's pretty broad across most of our categories. We are starting to increase in terms of the amount of discount and the mix on promotion. TVs was a place where we did see more promotions on a year-over-year basis. Computing has been starting more promotional all the way back to July of last year. So, that continued as well. So, those are the areas I would probably highlight, but there are also even just some very iconic type of products to in specific categories that are very promotional, even though in some cases inventory is constrained. And so overall, we know it's returning as we expected it would. It isn't quite back to FY \u201820 levels, but it is heading in the same \u2013 heading to that path as we expected. Thank you. Sure, yes. So, we are not going to comment on specific months, but March was the biggest decline in Q1. And as the sales pressure continued as we exited Q1 \u2013 actually, it was a little more pressure than on sales than we expected. If you remember last year, too, as we got into the second quarter, we talked about how we were still doing about a 30% comp in the first few weeks of May. So, we are still lapping those stimulus payments that kind of came in starting in March of last year. And so that's what's driving the lion's share of that sales decline. As you think about the back half of the year, I mean there is a number of things. We believe as you get to the back half, most of that stimulus impact, a lot of it will have left in terms of a comparison. We also know, as we look to the back half of the year, we do expect product availability and certain products and categories to improve compared to the first part of this year and also if you look at compared to last year, in Q4, there was some notable product shortages in iconic areas that we talked about not getting, that did have an impact on sales. We also, in Q4, shortened our store hours in January as we were lapping some of the Omicron variant impacts. And then lastly, I comment is we do expect our initiatives to start to continue to drive more impact to our sales outlook as you get further down into the trajectory of those ramps. So, those are the reasons I would highlight. Thank you. And I might just add, I think also, I think you made a question around the rate guide as well. I think as you think about the rate this year, we are actually not too far off from our original guidance expectations for this year from 5.2 to 5.4, just acknowledging a little bit of softer on the sales side. But all of the structural things that are included in that expectation are kind of coming in as we expect. It's nothing that's too dissimilar at this point. And we have already built those into what we see this year and what we see in the out years to be confident in addition to sales, but also being able to achieve some of those rate expectations for FY \u201825. Thank you. Yes. So, I would say it's fair to say we expect, like I said earlier, that promotions returned closer and closer to FY \u201820. Throughout this year, exactly when that happens, we are not commenting on, but we would expect it to increase as the year progresses. Importantly, as you look to the back half of this year, though we are starting to lap where promotions increased last year, starting in July in computing. So, we have baked into our plans a slow increase of promotionality in most categories as you get towards the back half of this year. Exactly where that lands exactly at FY \u201820, we are \u2013 it's hard to exactly say, but we have baked that into the plans. Sure. Yes. So, as we started the year, we \u2013 even the guide that we gave at 5.4% on a range of sales outcomes, we \u2013 there is a level of implied already trying to understand the levers you do to keep within the 5.4% rate in terms of the original guidance. So, it's something that we do as a normal course of business as we see sales slide up or slide down from our expectations. There are a number of areas where you can \u2013 that simply happen because they are variable to like check lane tender, but you also start to adjust areas like marketing or store labor associated with the lower volumes if it does happen. So, those are the variable things that we look at to adjust to as the sales trends change. In addition to that, there are even some more discretionary areas that you can start to look at in addition to variable items. But in some cases \u2013 or even additional marketing to the extent that you are comfortable or even simple areas like travel or adjusting your capital spend, which can adjust depreciation depending on when you do that during a year. So, there are variable and then more discretionary. And as Corie noted, we are not really planning for a recession this year. To the extent that we did, there is obviously more fixed cost areas you can look at if business trends down even more. Right now, we are not planning for that. You can imagine if that had happened, we would look at some of those areas as well. But we would \u2013 in any event, we are trying to hold dear to us strategic investments that we are making, that provide that long-term growth to get to our FY \u201825 goal. So, that's the last place that we will look at reducing as we look to this year in terms of how we see it now. Yes, I think we believe that it is structurally more profitable than it was pre-pandemic. As you think about some of the actions and work we have done over the last 2 years to adjust our model with the very heavy shift to digital sales almost doubling from pre-pandemic. We have taken appropriate action to understand the cost structures whether they are to support digital or in our stores or just to support a different type of customer fulfillment need. We have taken the right actions over that period of time to adjust our model \u2013 our cost model to understand \u2013 to account for the changing sales and margin structure \u2013 our gross margin structure. So, we fundamentally do believe that that's in how we actually decide to fulfill product to customers. That's on how many associates we have in our stores. It's a number of things that we have thoughtfully looked at over the last couple of years to change the structure of cost between gross margin rate and SG&A. So, we do believe that fundamentally, in Q1, we were up 80 basis points compared to Q1 pre-pandemic, and that is to account for even though we do have investments like Totaltech at 100 basis points in Q1 and have a doubling of the e-com business, which is a higher parcel cost, we are still getting SG&A leverage considerably better over in Q1 to offset some of those gross margin investments that we are actually making in our business. So, we fundamentally do believe that the structure of our business is finally more profitable. And that's also underlying in our commitment, our goal is to get to the FY \u201820 goals of 6.3% to 6.8%. Sure. I will start with the Totaltech pressure. As you look towards the back half of the year, we started to lap the launch of Totaltech. So, we expect the Q2 drivers to be similar to Q1. That would include Totaltech pressure of around 100 basis points. But as you look to Q3 and Q4, we begin to lap it. We launched Totaltech in October of last year, so we don't lap until the end of this Q3. So, there is still a little pressure from Totaltech in Q3. Then by Q4, the pressure on a year-over-year basis essentially goes down to zero, if you will, because we have lapped the launch of it. So, that's how the cadence of Totaltech pressure goes."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team's strong execution and focus on providing amazing service for our customers. Throughout the quarter, they navigated the uncertain macro environment and drove higher customer satisfaction scores while keeping energy and excitement going around the initiatives that we believe will drive longer term opportunities. We grew our Totaltech membership, increased momentum in our health business, launched new product categories and reached our fastest ever Q1 average online sales delivery speed. At our investor update in March, we said we expected our fiscal \u201823 financial results to look different. As we all lap stimulus and other government support, our industry cycles the last 2 years of unusually strong demand and we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. In addition, we said we expected promotional activity to increase and supply chain expenses to be a pressure. As such, we guided our annual comparable sales to decline 1% to 4% and our non-GAAP operating income rate to decline 60 basis points to approximately 5.4%. Therefore, the drivers of our Q1 financial results were largely as expected. Macro conditions worsened since we provided our guidance in early March, including higher inflation and the war in Ukraine, which resulted in our sales being slightly lower than our expectations and supply chain costs a little higher than we planned. Our investment in Totaltech at approximately 100 basis points of gross margin pressure was in line with our expectations and revenue from our credit card profit share was higher than anticipated. Overall, I am proud of our team's ability to develop and execute plans to adapt to the changing environment over the past 2 years and to the more recent macroeconomic conditions. Our revenue and profitability remained much stronger than they were pre-pandemic. Q1 revenue of $10.6 billion is $1.5 billion or 16% higher than Q1 of pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. And while our non-GAAP operating income rate is currently being impacted by our investments, it is still 80 basis points higher than fiscal \u201820 even with those investments and supply chain pressures. Our enterprise comparable sales declined 8% as we lapped particularly strong comparable sales last year. The 37% comp sales growth in Q1 of last year was driven by the timing of government stimulus payments, lapping a quarter during which our stores were closed early in the pandemic and the heightened demand for stay-at-home focused purchases. From a category standpoint, the biggest contributor to the comp sales decline, were computing and home theater. Although down from last year's strong sales compared to Q1 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue has grown more than 30%. Our domestic appliance business, which has grown every quarter, except for 1 for more than 10 years, delivered comparable sales growth of 3% on top of 67% growth last year. We aspire to help customers with all their technology needs in the most seamlessly possible across all touch points and we are encouraged by the improvements in our customer net promoter scores. We have been leveraging our omnichannel strength to serve and support our customers as their shopping behavior and expectations have evolved significantly over the past 2 years. While customers have returned to physical stores to see and touch products and get advice, our digital engagement with customers remains very high. Our online sales as a percentage of domestic sales are 31%, still twice as high as pre-pandemic levels and revenue from virtual phone and chat interactions continues to increase rapidly. Additionally, we are expanding our engagement with customers in their homes as in-home consultations and in-home installations are up significantly. During the quarter, we saw higher NPS overall and we saw our highest ever NPS from in-store purchases and in-store services. I would like to take a moment to expand on the topic of inflation, important in the current environment. Like other companies, we have seen cost inflation in areas such as labor, marketing and supply chain. However, this cost inflation was largely in line with our expectations and benefited from planning and execution over the previous 2 years. As it relates to product pricing, we have seen an increase in our average selling prices over the past 2 years due to a number of factors. First, our product sales mix has changed as customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. This has been happening for years and accelerated during the pandemic. Additionally, we have driven material growth in appliances, which carry high ASPs and have become a larger part of our mix. Second, there was overall lower promotional and markdown activity during much of the pandemic due to the shortage of product to meet demand. And third, our vendors are absorbing higher transportation and component costs and some of that has led to higher cost of goods sold for us. In many cases, we have passed through this higher cost of goods sold in the form of higher prices to customers. Importantly and fundamentally, we aim to be competitive in our pricing. We have seen a pickup in the promotional environment, as we have consistently noted, starting in July of last year. As we entered fiscal \u201823, we expected the promotional environment to create margin pressure in Q1 and throughout the year. In Q1, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. And some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre-pandemic levels. Turning back to our Q1 results, our ending inventory was up 9% compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenue since fiscal \u201820. Our teams did an amazing job actively managing inventory levels as the quarter progressed in this evolving supply and demand environment. Pockets of inventory constraints still exist, but are currently isolated to certain products and vendors. Overall, our inventory remains healthy. Even though inventory availability in CE is much better than it has been for much of the pandemic, the supply chain continues to be challenging with ongoing transportation disruptions and higher costs including containers, labor and fuel. We are, of course, not immune to the supply chain challenges in the world today and we are seeing some impacts on our business. We have invested in many aspects of our supply chain over the last several years in ways that have helped us navigate the environment and mitigate the impacts. We have employed a portfolio approach as it relates to carriers, transportation partners and parcel delivery partners. And we have built deep relationships across our supply chain, including port carriers and deconsolidation operations. In addition, we strategically leveraged the use of both rail and over-the-road transportation modes to move product. All of this has helped us to drive capacity, avoid large-scale disruption and mitigate cost increases. Importantly, our contractual relationships have allowed us to limit our exposure to the more turbulent spot market. The strong relationships we have cultivated with our vendors have also been crucial to our navigation of the supply chain environment. Working closely with our vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. Additionally, we actually handled transportation for many of our vendors, meaning we take control in Asia or Mexico. Then we have full visibility and control of the inventory movement and costs. We have invested in our distribution center network, effectively bringing product closer to customers and implementing technology solutions that increase productivity and speed to customer. We have also invested in our store-based fulfillment, including our ship-from-store customer fulfillment centers and implemented an effective employee delivery system. These investments have allowed us to make dramatic improvements in speed of delivery to our customers, even with the significant increase in volume in the past 2 plus years. In addition, we have many options for our customers to pickup their products themselves through in-store pickup, curbside pickup, lockers and alternate pickup locations. Customers clearly appreciate the convenience as the percentage of online sales picked up in stores has remained relatively consistent over the past several years at approximately 40%, even with the incredible improvements in shipping time. As it relates to ESG, we remain encouraged by the recent recognition of our work to support the environment and our community, both inside and outside Best Buy. We are proud to be included on Ethisphere's 2022 World's Most Ethical Companies list. We are one of only three retailers on it and it's our eighth time earning the honor. We were also included on the 2022 Forbes List of Best Employers for Diversity as one of the top four retailers on the list. It's our third consecutive year making the rankings that recognize leadership and commitment towards building a more inclusive workplace. During the quarter, we expanded our recycling program to include a new service for customers who are looking for our help recycling their large products. For a fee, we will go to customers' homes to pickup large electronics and appliances as well as an unlimited number of small products and ensure they are responsibly recycled and kept out of landfill. This service is in addition to our everyday recycling programs available at all Best Buy stores and our Holloway service with the purchase of new products. As I mentioned earlier our employees executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers. Even with the expected slowdown this year as we lap 2 plus years of pandemic impacts, we continue to be in a fundamentally stronger position than we expected to be at this point. We are confident in the strength of our business and excited about what lies ahead. We have a compelling value creation opportunity and are investing now as we have successfully invested ahead of change in our past, to ensure we are ready to meet the needs of our customers and retain our unique position in our industry. As we provided a more detailed investor update in combination with our Q4 results on March 3, I am not going to outline all our initiatives, but would like to provide a few updates on our progress. In March, we spoke quite a bit about Totaltech, our unique membership program that includes member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery and installation and 24/7 tech support. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers with complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. During the quarter, we continued to sign up more members as customers realize the great benefits of the program. And we are encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we continue to see from customers who have signed up to become members. We are pleased with the pace at which we are acquiring new members, especially considering the macro environment. We continue to see that Totaltech has broad appeal across customer segments. Additionally, we are improving our ability to gain members not only in retail stores, but in our digital and in-home channels. As a reminder, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer term benefit. We expect year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate to cease as we lapped the launch in October. And over time, we expect the incremental spend we garnered from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. Accordingly, Totaltech is a significant contributor to our fiscal \u201825 goals. As we outlined in March, we are optimizing our workforce and re-imagining our physical presence in ways that serve our customers' needs in our more digital world. We are making investments that provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as the customer moves from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home. This includes our virtual sales strategy. Early in the pandemic, the volume of customers interacting with us via phone and chat skyrocketed. The volume has remained high and we are actively working to increase the sales opportunity of these interactions through a number of efforts. One, we are leveraging a team of expert sales associates working from their homes, many of whom have in-depth store experience and are certified in multiple categories. Two, we have staffed our virtual store with dedicated experts who can help you via video and demo a product just like they would in our store. And three, we are enhancing the training for our offshore call center agents to help them feel like confident salespeople. We are already seeing great results as revenue from these interactions more than doubled in Q1 compared to last year. Enhancements to our technology platforms are in progress to further streamline our operations and enable these employees to chat, video, text, share their screens and transact. With this, we will be able to accelerate the productivity and sales opportunity further. We have spoken quite a bit about our consultation service that provides customers with expert help and inspiration tailored to their unique tech needs often right in their homes. This is growing and important as we continue to see very high customer satisfaction scores and increasing spend by customers who engage with the consultants. We also have a team that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries, including homebuilding, hospitality and healthcare. We have been growing this aspect of our business for several years and more recent investments in our digital capabilities and fulfillment have led to strong growth momentum that we expect will continue. For example, Q1 revenue from this team was up 15% over last year's Q1 and up more than 70% from Q1 of fiscal \u201820. As I step back to comment on our overall workforce, we have been actively evolving the composition of our teams throughout the last 2 years as customer behavior changed and became even more digitally focused. The result is that our overall headcount is actually lower than pre-pandemic. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interaction. We will continue to learn, evaluate and evolve the model in light of the way the business and shopping habits are changing. At the same time, we have invested and will continue to invest in flexibility, training, compensation and benefits for our associates. We are incredibly proud that our field turnover rates remain significantly below the retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates. Additionally, our store general manager turnover is just 6%, meaning our GMs have the tenure and experience to effectively help their teams navigate this dynamic environment. It is clear that we have store managers who are invested in their employees, their career paths, their well-being and their communities, and I thank them for their dedication. Of course, as previously noted, we are also re-imagining our physical stores. This year, we expect to complete approximately 45 remodels to implement our experience store concept. We are excited about these remodels as we continue to see higher revenue and NPS in the pilot locations compared to the controlled stores, especially as one of the pilots has been running almost 2 years. We also continue to see strong results from our outlet stores and are on track to rollout more this year with new stores opening soon in Chicago, Houston and Phoenix. Our outlet stores assort open box, clearance, end-of-life and otherwise distressed large product inventory in major appliances and televisions that might otherwise be liquidated at significantly lower recovery rate. We tend to see twice the recovery rate of our cost of goods sold when we sell this product at our outlets versus alternative channels. Additionally, these locations can attract new and reengaged customers. Last year, we estimate that approximately 16% of outlet customers were new to Best Buy and 37% were reengaged Best Buy customers. In fiscal \u201823, we plan to double the number of outlets by opening 15 additional stores, and we are expanding our assortment beyond major appliances and large TVs to include computing, gaming and mobile phones. We are already seeing increased performance in these new outlet formats as customers gravitate to the expanded assortment. Finally, these outlet stores are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in a landfill. And another important element of this circular economy strategy is our trade-in program. We have an extensive trade-in program covering more major CE categories than anyone else. In Q1, we took in 135,000 trade-in units from customers. Not only does our trade-in program keep tech products out of landfills, our customers typically spend 3x the amount they received on their trade-in on new products at Best Buy. We are continuing our category expansion strategy as well. For example, we're helping customers commute more sustainably with a new lineup of the best electric bike scooters and mopeds. Over the next 18 months, we will be bringing a selection of these products to nearly every Best Buy store. We're also rolling out charging devices, perfect for our customers' garages in several stores. And Geek Squad can not only assemble the e-bikes for customers, but we're also beginning a pilot to test service and repair for e-transportation products in some of our stores. We also just recently announced further expansion into the health and beauty category by launching new skincare technology products online and in 300 of our stores. In our Best Buy Health business, we are pleased with our first quarter momentum. In Q1, we saw strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. In our Emerging Virtual Care business, we connect patients with their physicians to enable care at home. Last November, we acquired Current Health, a technology company with an FDA-cleared monitoring platform for care at home to help us accelerate our strategy. The combination of Current Health offerings and our scale, presence and Geek Squad in-home capabilities is already resonating with the healthcare industry. Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking quarter ever, including expansion of its relationships with health systems such as Mount Sinai Health System, Parkland Health, as well as the UK National Health Service and others. I'm excited to share that Current Health was awarded best hospital technology implementation in the 2022 MedTech Breakthrough Awards program for its role supporting health systems across the U.S. implement innovative care home programs. Current Health was also selected by Frost & Sullivan as the 2022 Company of the Year in the global virtual home care platform industry. In summary, I am proud of how much we accomplished in the first quarter and excited about what lies ahead for us. Clearly, there remains a great deal of uncertainty. On one hand, consumers still have relatively strong balance sheet, they continue to spend, wages are up and unemployment is at record lows. On the other hand, many consumers are lapping stimulus income they received last year and are also facing issues like higher gas and food prices, rising interest in mortgage rates, recession fears, stock market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine. Underlying all that is the gradual shifting of spend from stay-at-home purchases to more experiential spend on services and the activities, many were unable to enjoy during the pandemic. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, while the drivers of our results were largely as expected, the comparable sales decline of 8% was on the softer side as inflationary pressures heightened throughout the quarter. That trend has continued into the beginning of Q2, and it does not appear that it will abate in the near-term. Therefore, as Matt will outline, we are revising our guidance and now expect fiscal \u201823 comparable sales decline in the range of 3% to 6%. And we are correspondingly updating our non-GAAP operating income rate to a range of 5.2% to 5.4%. We will continue to proactively navigate this rapidly changing environment, balancing the day-to-day operations with our commitment to our long-term strategy and growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 and our outlook, I want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers in all our channels. I greatly appreciate your teamwork and perseverance. I love the Best Buy culture and our commitment to enriching lives through technology. And I will close by saying this. We firmly believe that technology is more relevant today than ever. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology, and we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers' homes right for their lives. From our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn't working the way you want or traded in recycling when you want to upgrade. We believe we have an ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt. Thank you. Yes. So I'm just going to start by taking a little bit of a step back here. Obviously, what we're aiming to do here is take our deep knowledge of the customer, combined with our history of a multitude of membership programs and our unique abilities to create a very unique paid membership offer with very broad reach. That broad appeal means we see more different types of demographics that this appeals to. And by the way, it is also more comfortable to sell because our associates just have a lot of passion around the multitude of offers. To specifically your question about what's resonating, the truth is all aspects are resonating, but different pieces seem to resonate with different demographics. Certainly, the included warranty aspects, especially the Apple Care resonates with some of our younger demographics. The pricing and discounts actually resonates across all and then the support we see resonate with some of our older demographics. So the point here is actually this broad reach of a multitude of pieces of the offer that will actually appeal to many. The purpose, as we said, is to drive frequency and share of wallet over time. The reason we're not updating right now is we are just starting to lap our beta test from last year. If you remember, we actually launched in April with the full rollout in October. And so we are literally just getting a feel now for what retention looks like. It remains in line with \u2013 as we've converted customers remains in line with what we had expected. But right now, we're just \u2013 we want to actually start to lap some of those new customers who actually opted into the program before we comment too much on retention. What I will say is, look, the goal here is to create a moat around the consumer and to make it kind of inconceivable for them to buy CE anywhere else. And we know we're growing our share of wallet with those that are shopping us. So we know it's doing what we want it to do, but we're using this time period to continue to learn and iterate on the acquisition, the usage that we're seeing right now and then ultimately those retention figures. Thank you. Thanks Joe. Yes. So, I will start with the fiscal \u201825 guidance. I am going to reiterate what Matt said. It is still really early in the long-range guide that we gave. And there are many moving parts and pieces as I outlined in some of the prepared comments. And so we remain confident in the initiatives and the roadmap that we have put together to deliver that \u201825 guide. And as Matt said, it's a pretty wide range. So, what we are going to use this year to do is to continue to understand how those initiatives develop, how this year plays out, obviously, and then how the implications for all of that in that longer term guide. But I think it warrants giving it some time to see how the year is going to play. Specific to your point about recession, I want to take one step back here for a second. I think I want to start with a reminder that this is a very stable industry. Consumer electronics, over time, is a stable industry. And the last 2 years have clearly underscored the importance of tech in people's lives. So, I think it's important for us to have that as a backdrop and the fact that we were obviously already planning for our industry to decline this year, and then we have adjusted based on what we are seeing in the recent results. It's fair to say that we are factoring in elements of softer demand, but we are not planning for a full recession or guide. We will not assume a full recession at this point. Obviously, if that were the case, we will continue to update the performance and the expectations. But I think I would characterize our guide more as a softer environment, not a full recession. And I think it's worth noting, and I know all of you know this, but just to reiterate. Obviously, promotions are not just a function of Best Buy. They are a function of relationships with our vendors as well. We are interested in ensuring that their newest and greatest products are out there for the world to see and priced appropriately. So, this is not just a function of Best Buy promotionality. It's a function of the overall industry promotionality in partnership with our vendors. I do think it's fair to say the team has obviously navigated this softening environment quite well up to this point. And obviously, the factors that we use, as we are trying to adjust to that softer demand, obviously overlap with the considerations that you would take into account if you are managing for a recession. So, you can imagine behind the scenes, you are running through a bunch of scenarios. And I think the team has done a nice job flexing with a rapidly changing environment and it's that same type of kind of mindset and considerations you would take if that were to flex down even further. Thank you. Yes. First, just some gratitude to the team who has really done amazing work, carefully managing our inventory levels and then importantly, leveraging some of the investments that we have made in our supply chain. Some context is helpful here. Our inventory balance was unusually low last year. So again, if you remember how much demand there was in the marketplace at 37% comp, we had an unusually low balance last year. And that inventory balance right now is almost perfectly in line with the sales growth versus pre-pandemic. So, if you went back to kind of normalized pre-pandemic, now, sales growth and inventory growth are almost perfectly in line. And I think that's a true testament to our vendor partnerships and proactively managing those levels in line with what we have been seeing. Behind the theme, as you can imagine, actually, units in some of the key categories are down as we have seen ASP shifting from the variety of factors that I noted, whether it's premium and the mix shift in our business or inflation. So, that's even what underscores the confidence that I have in the statement around our inventory being healthy, feeling very much like it's in the right place. I think it is important to note, there is still some spotty constraints in very isolated areas for specific vendors and some of the more iconic SKUs that Matt mentioned. But over-archingly, we feel very strongly that we are in a good inventory position, and that's very much in line with how we have managed inventory historically. Yes. We haven't sized it specifically as I kind of alluded to the fact. It's really hard because back to when about the different pieces that are driving our ASPs up, du have got mix shifts in the business. As people have skewed more premium, you have got more appliances, which tends to skew to higher ASPs. You have got over-archingly, over the last couple of years, fewer markdowns, less promotions, and then you also have inflation. So, all of those pieces add into the ASP increases we have been seeing. That's why the color I am trying to give is we have actually seen in many of the key categories at the unit levels of our inventory are actually down versus some of the pre-pandemic comparisons and a lot of that is being driven by this kind of confluence of ASP increase. Yes. Thanks. I will start and then Matt can clean up anything that I miss. But you have to also look back to last year, and Matt alluded to this. We have that really high sustained growth into May, like we posted the 37% comp in Q1, and then that sustained 30s into May. So, we were we \u2013 unlike some others, we are lapping very sustained high growth, both stimulus related, stay at home related from last year, which is a different cadence. I also think you have heard other retailers comment on the weather and some of the \u2013 and that's not going to impact our business nearly as much as others. So, I think from a \u2013 like when we \u2013 you almost have to go back to kind of a 3-year look at the business, it's relatively consistent and actually pretty strong as we are heading into Q2 on that 3-year stack. Yes. And just a quick reminder on the ads business. Obviously, this is us selling advertising to brands that want to reach our customers, both on our own channels and then on some external sites. I think what's important here is that our leadership in CE retail remains very, very valuable, high customer traffic and engagement. And it's that first-party data that we have, which can allow our advertisers to reach really unique audiences. Because we see people all along their purchase journey, which means you can target them at various points in the purchase journey. We haven't shared specific financial details, but we did see growth in the ads business in Q1, not material enough to highlight for the quarter, but even entering the year. We knew this would be a favorable contributor to the gross profit rate, but a little bit more weighted towards the second half of the year as this ramp continues. And then obviously, this is something that provides that ongoing growth and incremental profitability over time that gives us confidence in those longer term targets. Thank you, Peter. And with that, I want to thank you all for joining us today. I hope that many of our investors who are listening today will be able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 9th. Thanks everyone and have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded for playback and will be available at approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]\n I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nMollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.\n Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.\n Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\n I will now turn the call over to Corie. \nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm proud of the performance of our teams across the company as they showed resourcefulness, passion and unwavering focus on our customers this past year. Throughout fiscal '24, we demonstrated strong operational execution as we navigated a pressured CE sales environment. This allowed us to deliver annual profitability at the high end of our original guidance range even though sales came in below our original guidance range. Importantly, we grew our paid membership base and drove customer experience improvements in many areas of our business, particularly in services and delivery.\n For Q4 specifically, we are reporting profitability at the high end of our expectations, with revenue near the middle of our guidance range. Our comparable sales declined 4.8% in the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our gross profit rate 50 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program as well as Best Buy Health.\n Excluding the impact of the extra week, we lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations. As expected, customers were very deal-focused through the holiday season, and the promotional environment overall was in line with our expectations. While shopping patterns more closely resembled historical holiday periods and Black Friday and Cyber Week performances were in line with our expectations, the sales lull in December was even steeper than we had modeled. Then customer demand strengthened considerably and was higher than we expected during the 4 days before Christmas.\n Our Q4 digital sales mix was flat to last year at 38% of total domestic sales. Customer in-store pickup of online orders was also consistent at 44%. We improved our delivery speeds, expanding the percent of ship-to-home online orders delivered in 2 days. We have been very focused on getting our app in the hands of customers. And I'm pleased to say that on Black Friday, it ranked #3 across shopping apps and #4 across all apps on Apple's App Store.\n We ended the quarter and year with 7 million members across our 2-tiered My Best Buy paid memberships. Paid members consistently showed higher levels of interaction with comparatively higher levels of spend at Best Buy and a shift of spend away from competitors. From a financial perspective, membership delivered another quarter of higher-than-expected operating income rate contribution. When you include the changes we made to the free tier and the impact of the midyear changes we made to the paid program benefits, our membership program contributed approximately 45 basis points of enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion for the full year.\n And our Best Buy Health business achieved its operating income contribution target of 10 basis points for the year. In addition, we announced strategic partnerships with Advocate Health, Geisinger Health and Mass General Brigham, and our care at home platform is now being used in 8 of the top 20 health systems in the U.S.\n Now I would like to look forward to fiscal '25. We expect this to be a year of increasing industry stabilization. Our strategy is to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding, our operating income rate on a 52-week basis.\n Therefore, our fiscal '25 priorities are as follows: one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore, pilot and drive incremental revenue streams.\n There's a lot to unpack. I'll start with a discussion about the macro environment, the CE industry and our sales expectations. At the highest level, there have been and continue to be macro pressures impacting retail overall and CE more specifically.\n First, inflation has been slowing, but prices for the basics like food and lodging are still much higher and consumers have to prioritize and make trade-off spend decisions. Second, there is a consumer propensity to spend on services like concerts and vacations in lieu of goods, which has remained sticky even as the prices there too have inflated.\n Third, we have a relatively stagnant housing market. Fourth, CE was a significant recipient of a pull forward of demand during the first 2 years of the pandemic. When consumers need to prioritize the basics that usually does not include the product purchases they recently pulled forward. And lastly, the level of CE product innovation has been lowered during the pandemic and supply chain challenged years.\n It's not so much about each of these individually, but when you stack the five, it has been a heavy weight on the industry. On the positive side, experience tells us that these are all cyclical and transient in nature. And while they are ebbing and flowing, we are optimistic that several indicators will continue to show favorability this year. These include decreasing inflation leading to the lowering of interest rates, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound.\n We remain confident that our industry will grow again after 2 years of declines. This is simply a matter of the timing. Our underlying thesis is consistent. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products in consumers' homes.\n Second, we expect to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bot early in the pandemic kick in this year and into the next few years. Third, we are returning to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation after a pause during the pandemic.\n Taking all these factors and considerations into account, we expect fiscal '25 comparable sales to be flat to last year on the high end of our guidance range, down in the first half and up in the second half of the year. The low end of our annual comp sales range is a decline of 3%, reflecting a scenario where the mix of the factors I just discussed results in lower customer demand.\n From a category standpoint, we expect sales in our computing category to improve through the year and show growth for the full year as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We are already beginning to see the improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter and are trending positively so far this quarter.\n At this point in time, we expect revenue for the rest of our product categories to stabilize through the year and be flattish to slightly down for the full year, partially offset by the continued growth of our services revenue.\n Even though overall, we are expecting flattish sales growth for the full year, there are many examples of innovation both already introduced and expected through the year that we believe will drive interest including the Samsung AI-enabled phone we are already seeing materially more demand than we expected, new emerging content for VR/AR devices, Ray-Ban smart glasses, Bose open year headphones, EV universal charging devices and a proliferation of 98-inch screen TVs, to name a few.\n Also, the level of exciting and cool new tech at the Consumer Electronics Show in January felt back to normal. Of course, some of that cool new tech hits the market over the following year while some of it is still a few years from consumer launch.\n Now I would like to provide more details on some of the key initiatives within each of our fiscal '25 priorities to capitalize on that industry stability. As I mentioned, our first priority is to invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences. Our first initiative is to materially elevate personalization. We are focused on providing increasingly personalized, highly relevant and motivational content for our known identified customers. We can attribute roughly 90% of our annual revenue to known customers.\n Let's start with our efforts around our paid membership program. Here, we're creating seamless, tailored experiences for our members based on their unique preferences or context. Our app first member deals experience is a great example of this. Rather than bombarding our members with thousands of great member deals, we focus on the experience on the most relevant offers based on their preferences and observed member data.\n Additionally, we're adding personalization across the membership journey, including in-store at POS, where later this year will include props to provide both sales associates and customers with relevant contextual information about their membership like their savings, rewards, protection plans and offers. We will also include personalized dynamic messaging in our communications to members about their upcoming program renewals. These efforts and more will serve to increase membership engagement and continue to improve retention.\n As we think about our broader known customer base, we are fortunate to have a tremendous amount of first-party customer data for our advanced analytics capabilities to leverage. While we are elevating personalization across our customer interactions, I'm particularly excited about the work we are doing with our app. We are currently testing a personalization-centric version of the app homepage with the stories and actions that matter most to customers, along with critical content and plan to launch to all customers during the second quarter.\n The second initiative is to invest back into our store experience. Our stores are crucial assets that provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and convenient multichannel fulfillment. Customer shopping behavior has evolved in the last 4 years. And this year, we are particularly focused on ensuring we provide the experience that customers expect to have when they take the time to come into our stores.\n As a result, our capital investments for fiscal '25 are concentrated more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels or store openings. We plan to touch every single store in the chain in some fashion, improving both our merchandising and ease of shopping for customers.\n This includes improving and livening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the sales floor. It also includes rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we're leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. For example, we will be removing physical media and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home departments.\n We are also excited to partner even more with our vendors this year as it relates to their branded in-store merchandise experiences. The coming innovation, combined with our plan to refresh every store in our fleet, provides much more opportunity for vendor investments in our stores. A few examples I can share at this time include Tesla, LoveSac and Starlink.\n Although we still see opportunities for additional large experienced store remodels, we believe we have a better opportunity to improve existing store experiences at scale in fiscal '25. At the same time, we are planning to open a few additional outlet centers and new formats to continue to test 2 important concepts.\n First, we will open small locations in a couple of out state markets where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low to measure our ability to capture untapped share. Second, we will test our ability to close a large format store and open a small format store nearby, thereby maximizing physical store retention through convenience. These learnings will collectively continue to help us refine our forward-looking store strategy.\n In addition to a great physical experience, we want to ensure our customers receive the expert service interactions they want and Best Buy is known for when they come to our stores. During fiscal '25, we will continue to leverage our multiskilled store associates, but in hundreds of stores we will also add back fully dedicated expertise in key categories like major appliances, home theater and computing.\n Our plan is to deploy some of our most skilled sellers against these categories and double down on category-specific training and certifications for these employees. We know that our selling certifications create a better experience for our customers as our certified employees on average drive nearly 15% higher revenue per transaction and garner higher Net Promoter Scores than a noncertified employee.\n In fact, the third initiative under our drive targeted customer experiences priority is to make sure we are prepared to bring coming innovation to life for customers in ways no one else can. This means we need to be ready to leverage the unique strengths that make us the best place for customers to see new tech and the best partner for vendors to launch NewTek.\n This includes everything from expertly trained associates who can explain the new technology and what it can do for you, the best merchandising presentation both in-store and online, all the way to great trade-in values for customers who use technology. This will be particularly important later this year when more computing products featuring AI are expected to launch.\n As a reminder, we hold 1/3 of the retail market share in both the U.S. computing and television industries, roughly 20% in gaming and well over 10% share in other categories like major appliances. We intend to strengthen our position in these key categories through the initiatives I just outlined as well as pointed marketing spend and sharp pricing.\n Our second key priority for the year is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. We have a longstanding commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies to help offset inflationary pressures in our business and fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives.\n Our fiscal '25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely and effectively.\n Let me provide a few specific examples of how we are leveraging it. One, we're using AI to route our in-home delivery and installation trucks to drive more efficient scheduling and a better customer experience. Two, we are leveraging AI to summarize the main points and follow-ups from each of our customer service calls. It also improves the accuracy of the interaction and data collection while reducing average engagement time by almost 5%.\n To help us enhance our overall tech development effectiveness we are leveraging gen AI code generation and shared resources for our engineers. We are also establishing a digital and technology hub in Bangalore, India, which will give us expanded, more economical access to talent and skills. The hub will open and begin the process of onboarding team members later this year.\n In addition, in fiscal '25, we are taking actions to, one, ensure our resources are directed at the right strategic areas; and two, to rightsize our model based on current operations. These actions will allow us to do the following: balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop, redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago. whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits.\n While we made these decisions during the fourth quarter, which resulted in a restructuring charge that Matt will discuss later, many of the actions will be implemented through the first half of fiscal '25 and we will provide more details as we move through the year.\n Our third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. This will include striking the appropriate balance of prioritizing areas that best position us for the future while prudently dealing with the near-term uncertainty in the CE industry. There are a few key points that I want to highlight.\n First, as it relates to our capital allocation strategy, our overall approach isn't changing. We still plan to first fund operations and investments in areas necessary to grow our business, and next, return excess free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n Second, while our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal '25 are planned at a similar level to last year, our Domestic segment capital expenditures are expected to decline by approximately $50 million due to the store portfolio investment approach I discussed earlier and lower technology-related expense. This is offset by a year-over-year planned increase in CapEx in Canada to reflect investments for new stores and necessary supply chain automation projects.\n Third, and consistent with our practice over the past several years, we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. Our teams have done a tremendous job managing our inventory in a very uneven sales environment, keeping inventory aligned with our forward-looking sales projections while, at the same time, maintaining as much flexibility as possible. And lastly, this morning, we announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. This represents the 11th straight year of dividend increases and puts our current dividend yield near 5%.\n Our fourth key priority for fiscal '25 is longer term in focus. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams over time. The most developed example of this is Best Buy Health, where we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad agents to capitalize on the growing use of technology to help provide health care in the home.\n While still very small in relation to our core business, our fiscal '25 Best Buy Health sales are expected to grow faster than the core business, which, combined with cost synergies from fully integrating acquired companies, are expected to drive another 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion.\n Another example is our recently announced collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 165 small-format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada. These stores, previously known as The Source, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada, will be rebranded as Best Buy Express. We will provide the CE assortment as well as supply chain, marketing and e-commerce.\n Bell will continue to be the exclusive telecommunication services provider and will also be responsible for the store operating costs and labor components of the partnership. This collaboration will allow us to expand our presence in malls and in smaller and midsized communities across Canada. Best Buy Express stores are expected to roll out during the second half of this year.\n Other examples of opportunities we are pursuing include continuing to build out our business case for Geek Squad as a service and adding vendors to our supply chain partner plus program.\n Before I close and turn the call over to Matt, I wanted to touch on a few of the ways we are being recognized for the support we provide to our employees and communities. From an employee standpoint, I'm proud to share that we continue to maintain industry low turnover rates and our fiscal '24 employee turnover was down on a year-over-year basis.\n To that end, this is our second year as the #1 retailer on the Just Capital List, which evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., in part on how a company invests in its workforce. This year will also mark the fifth anniversary of our caregiver pay benefit. During that time, we've supported 22,000 employees with almost 3 million hours of time away, so they could care for those who matter most.\n We continue to be credited as a leader in sustainability. In Q4, for the 13th year, we were named to the annual Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We were also just named for the seventh consecutive year, to the CDP's prestigious Climate A List, which looks at how organizations demonstrate best practices associated with environmental leadership.\n In summary, we are focused and energized about delivering on our purpose to Enrich Lives through Technology in a vibrant, always changing industry. We don't assort tech products just for the sake of technology. We see technology and service of humans. And as the largest CE specialty retailer with our unique range of product assortment and expert services, we deliver that human experience to millions of customers.\n I want to reiterate our fiscal '25 strategy in what we expect to be a year of increasing industry stabilization we are focused on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. We are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal '25 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income rate.\n I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q4 financial performance and our outlook. \nMatthew Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Before getting into our quarterly results, let me start by sharing a few details on the extra week that occurred in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra week added approximately $735 million in enterprise revenue and approximately $0.30 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the quarter. Also as a reminder, revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculation.\n Next, I will share details on the fourth quarter results including the extra week. Enterprise revenue of $14.6 billion declined 4.8% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% improved 20 basis points compared to last year and included a 50 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate.\n Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $30 million higher than last year and increased approximately 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.72.\n When viewing our performance compared to our expectations, revenue was near the midpoint of our guidance. As Corie mentioned, our comparable sales trends were not linear, with the more traditional holiday shopping days being our strongest from a growth perspective. Our comparable sales by month were November, down 5%; December, down 2%; and January, down 12%.\n Although our sales were near the midpoint of our guidance, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% was at the high end. Our gross profit rate was higher than we expected, primarily driven by a more favorable gross profit rate in our services category, which includes our membership offerings. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense was near the high end of our expectations due to additional incentive compensation.\n Next, I will walk through the details of our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 0.9% to $13.4 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.1% and was partially offset by approximately $675 million in revenue from the extra week. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were home theater, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, which were partially offset by growth in gaming.\n From organic's perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was slightly higher than last year. The growth was primarily due to an increased mix of units coming from higher ticket items such as notebooks and TVs, even though the individual ASPs for both of those categories were down year-over-year.\n International revenue of $1.2 billion increased 2.7%, primarily driven by approximately $60 million of revenue from the extra week, which was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.4%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 60 basis points to 20.4%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvements from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category.\n In addition, the higher gross profit rate from our Best Buy Health initiatives also contributed to the improved rate. The previous items were partially offset by lower product margin rates.\n Consistent with the third quarter, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction to cost of sales last year. We anticipate a similar recognition of this funding in the first half of fiscal '25 or approximately $20 million a quarter.\n Moving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $17 million, which was primarily driven by the extra week and higher incentive compensation, which were partially offset by lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising expense. Our International non-GAAP SG&A increased $13 million, which was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and the extra week.\n In the fourth quarter, as Corie alluded to, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs. The related actions span multiple areas across our organization and include approximately $65 million for actions that won't be implemented until fiscal '26.\n Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 4% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory.\n During fiscal '24, our total capital expenditures were $795 million versus $930 million in fiscal '23. The largest drivers of the year-over-year decline was a reduction in store-related investments. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n Moving on to our full year fiscal '25 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%, which compares to an estimated 4% non-GAAP operating income rate for fiscal '24 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20.\n In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million to $800 million. And lastly, we expect to spend approximately $350 million on share repurchases, which is similar to our fiscal '24 spend.\n Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance. As our ongoing practice, we will continue to close existing traditional stores during our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. In fiscal '24, we closed 24 stores. And in fiscal '25, we expect to close 10 to 15 stores.\n Earlier, Corie provided context on our fiscal '25 top line assumptions. Let me spend more time on the profitability outlook. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 20 to 30 basis points compared to fiscal '24 due to the following actions and initiatives.\n First, continued profitability improvements of our services and membership offerings is expected to provide approximately 45 basis points of gross profit rate expansion. The achievement of this improvement essentially recoups the original investment of our previous Total Tech offering that was scaled nationally in October of 2021.\n The expected rate improvement is due to higher revenue from installation and delivery services, which were previously included benefits of paid membership and a lower cost to serve due to lower expected volume for in-home installation and other related services. The unit volume of these services is still expected to be above pre-pandemic levels but below the elevated levels we experienced when Total Tech members receive them as a benefit at no incremental cost. We also expect Best Buy Health to add a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to our enterprise profit -- gross profit rate on a year-over-year basis.\n Partially offsetting the previous items is approximately 20 basis points expected pressure from a lower profit share on a credit card arrangement. In fiscal '24, our profit share was approximately 1.4% of domestic revenue, consistent with fiscal '23. The expected pressure in fiscal '25 is primarily due to expected increases in net credit losses. This estimate does not include implications from any proposed changes to late fee regulation. We also expect that our product margin rates will experience slight pressure.\n Now moving to our SG&A expectations. The high end of our guidance assumes SG&A dollars are similar to fiscal '24, which includes the following puts and takes. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high end of our guidance assuming an increase of $40 million compared to fiscal '24. We expect advertising expense to increase by approximately $50 million.\n Partially offsetting previous items is the benefit of 1 less week, which is estimated at approximately $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends.\n Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 5%, which aligns with our estimated February performance. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 first quarter rate of 3.4%.\n We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, in line with the 20 to 30 basis point improvement we are expecting for the full year. SG&A dollars are expected to decline as a percentage in the low single-digit range with the decrease primarily due to lower store payroll expense.\n I will now turn the call over to operator for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. \nScot Ciccarelli: This is probably difficult to answer but I'd be interested in any color you might have. When you kind of look at the comp performance and the comp decline, how would you segment it between, let's call it, broader pressures on discretionary spending versus, let's call it, the pull forward of demand that happened during the pandemic? Because we're kind of getting into that kind of 4-year period since the pandemic. Typical life cycle of a lot of your products is 3 to 5 years. Just how are you guys kind of thinking about that? Or is it at all possible to segment that? \nCorie Barry: I wish there was an exact science to this one. That being said, we did try to give you in the prepared remarks a few indicators that we're seeing that say we might be starting to get into that replacement cycle. We talked specifically about laptop units returning to growth in Q4 and that trend continuing here as we head into Q1. That, to me, feels like an early indicator of at least some foray into that replacement cycle.\n Because honestly, really, right now, there isn't any massive current innovation that would spur you to go buy a new laptop. There's a little bit but we're expecting more as the year goes on. And then obviously, that -- the laptop category would be kind of earlier in the realm of replacement cycles that we've talked about.\n So I think you're starting to see some goodness there, Scot, which makes me think a little bit more of the overhang that we're seeing is that kind of combo batter of 5 macro factors that I talked about that continue to weigh on the industry and haven't abated nearly to the pace that I think anyone thought from a macro perspective. \nScot Ciccarelli: That's helpful, Corie. And then one other quick one. Like, you guys talked a bit earlier in the script on personalization. I guess the question is for your kind of category, do you get enough frequency in terms of customer visits to really be able to little leverage that data and the personalization that you're targeting? \nCorie Barry: I think what's important is to differentiate purchase frequency from the frequency of interacting with the brand. And we have the luxury because we do know -- like I said, 90% of our purchasing customers we can identify, we can actually see many behaviors. And people don't just come to us because they want to make a purchase.\n There's a lot of research done in the category. There are repairs done in the category. There are curiosity about upgrades done in the category. And so we do see enough frequency of visits and our ability to understand how the consumer is acting that do allow us to make those personalizations.\n And that's why one of the things that we mentioned and why we try to get really specific examples is in the app, having that personalized front page means we're not just targeting you for what you might purchase next. We're literally trying to figure out your next best action, and that action might just be discovery.\n You might just want to come and scroll through and take a look at what's new or what's coming and educate yourself. And we will gladly help you do that. And so I think the next realm of personalization -- I think personalization often gets lumped in with purchase. And it's for us, in particular, because we really deal with the full life cycle of how people use these products, it's a lot broader than that. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: So I want to start, Corie, bigger picture. You mentioned in your prepared comments, I know we've been talking a while about this AI. We talked about some of the products and then how Best Buy's utilizing AI in its own business model. The question I have is as you're talking now to your vendor partners, maybe going back to CES or before, how much excitement is starting to really build around AI as -- in terms of products that we could see in the relative near term for Best Buy, from a consumer base standpoint? \nCorie Barry: Yes. I will give you my very best qualitative answer here. I think if you followed what happened at the Consumer Electronics Show in January at all, it was, I would argue, the largest foray into how AI will impact our world going forward from here, particularly as it relates to consumer electronics.\n And I think in the coming year, there's enough noise out there that you can get this feel that you're going to start to see the computing side of this really start to take light and make it easier and more seamless for everyone to be able to use tools that will help them be more efficient and effective.\n But the horizon question, and that's how I like to think about it, I like to think about it as the kind of innovation horizon, I think, is really vibrant right now in terms of what AI technology might be able to do. Because it's not just compute. It gets into like how smart can I make the things around me.\n And one of the other things that's really interesting about AI is it actually makes consumer electronics products more human. And so there's this question of how do I make these CE products interact with me more seamlessly?\n How are the robots that are in my house even smarter because they can triangulate faster and they just get smarter on their own? So my little robot vacuum gets smarter every single time that I use it, right?\n And so these aren't just innovations in the compute side of things. You're starting to see it in the phone side of things. You're starting to see it and how far can we kind of push the envelope on what consumer electronics can do for you in your home to just make your home life more seamless.\n So I'm not saying it's going to be a revolution overnight, Brian, to be clear. But I do definitely see more excitement and kind of this unlock in how technology can fit even more seamlessly into your life. \nBrian Nagel: That's very, very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up, unrelated. With regard to the [Technical Difficulty] normalization within the CE category, you talked about through the holiday promotions being, I guess, normal. But the question I have is, are you seeing more nonspecific CE retailers come back to the category now as the overall consumer backdrop normalizes post pandemic? \nCorie Barry: I wouldn't say there's more. I mean, I think when we were headed into holiday, we said this is typically a category that is promotional. It's typically a category that many different partners play in for the holiday because whether or not it blew the doors off, it is always a category that people look for as it relates to holiday. And so I think you always see some players come in and out of the space as it relates to gifting and CE as a gift. And I -- my personal point of view, didn't see more than we would have expected this holiday than any other.\n Obviously, we're always watching the competitive landscape. But I think that's why we're really focused in the coming year on our unique positioning in the CE landscape and the both pre-purchase and then post-purchase offerings that we have that are pretty unique in the marketplace, no matter who enters it. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: It's on market share trends. Best Buy has always been very dynamic with its strategy. It's one of the factors that has led to its success that it's been able to change with the market, but it does seem like in the last several years the pace of change with the strategy has increased significantly, whether it comes to membership, store format, the composition of store associates. How do you think this is having an impact on Best Buy's market share especially in light of the fact that if we look at Best Buy sales in the Domestic segment for this year, it's likely that the company is going to be on pace to have sales that are about $2 billion below where they were in 2019. \nCorie Barry: Yes. So let me start a little near term and then I'll work my way back to a little bit longer term. You're right, there have been a number of strategic pivots in the model. And to be clear, this is in service of bolstering our position in the market. That is why we are making the changes that we are, and it's also in service of a changing consumer who expects a different experience. So we've said it many times, Michael, and I know you're familiar. There isn't a great single source of share here for consumer electronics because nobody covers all the categories that we do.\n But for the Circana track categories, which represent about 70% of our revenue, we held share in Q4 and for the full year, year-over-year. With the same caveats as I think about the last several years, and this is one we have to try to analyze multiple sources over a longer-term period. We believe we've actually largely held share in the key categories since the beginning of the pandemic.\n Like I said, it is a difficult science because there are so many different sources. But you can imagine, as you started with the question, strategically, we are incredibly focused on those real key categories that are important and underline our strategy to really kind of own that home experience and that CE experience end-to-end for our consumers.\n So we are tracking this carefully, and I can promise you that the changes to the model are not for the fun of it. The changes are definitely in service of different customer expectations and our commitment to hold position in this industry. \nMichael Lasser: Got it. My follow-up question is, as we look at our model and make an assessment of what the recovery in consumer electronics retail looks like over the next few years, what is the rule of thumb that we should be using in regards to Best Buy sales versus its operating margin and the amount of leverage that the model will produce in light of all the changes that have been made in the last few years? Is there a rule of thumb that you can give us to guide us on how we should be projecting over the next couple of years? \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes, Michael, I'll take that. I think if I look at just going forward in an ideal setting, when you get past the flat to slightly down year this year, we do expect when you look out into the next number of years that the industry will continue to grow and that we will grow along with it.\n I think it is our expectation that we will continue to grow sales. It's our expectation that we will continue to expand our operating profit rate as we do that. And to your point, part of that is we expect to be able to leverage on SG&A and take advantage of not just all the initiatives that are adding to our improvements over this last year, but also just a good focus on cost control and efficiency.\n And so I think by that center, I'm not going to give you a specific how much does rate improve by every point of comp. But it would be our expectation as we grow a few percentage points, we will be able to expand our rate.\n And I think year-to-year, I think that takes on a little different color as you think about one given year and you move into next year with a different level of operating revenue with a consistent level of cost structure. You can imagine that it does help expand your rate a little bit more as you go from one year to the next. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on the sales outlook. As you think about sales down in the first half, up in the second half, any more views on the role that housing and moving activity plays in that? I think some of our work has suggested that there is an impact, but obviously, it's not the only driver. Innovation and a lot of the other things you talked about makes sense. But I guess, how do you think about housing and what's embedded here in the outlook as you think about the opportunity for improvement? \nCorie Barry: You said it very well. It's not a perfect correlation with our business, the housing market, I mean. But there are definitely pieces of the business that tend to correlate more highly, particularly as you think about appliances, and then somewhat as you kind of creep into television. Those tend to be the areas that are most highly correlated. In the prepared remarks, I talked about that kind of stacked macro pressures on CE.\n And then alluded to the fact that the high end of the range at a flat comp for the year, we're assuming that a few of these in particular start to abate. You're starting to see inflation pull back a bit, that one is important. And also, you are starting to at least see the -- what I'd like to call the green shoots of the housing market maybe start to turn in a bit more positive direction.\n So I would assume that in that -- again, at that top end of the guide that we were talking about, we continue to maybe see a bit of that slow progression of improvement.\n There is nothing that would say we expect changes overnight. There's nothing that would say we expect all of a sudden, it's all sunshine and roses in the housing market. But I think in general, we're starting to see enough of the green shoots that make you feel like, yes, there might be a bit of improvement there that helps buoy at least that part of the business.\n That being said, we also said on the downside scenario at a down 3% comp maybe don't see the level of recovery in any of those macro factors that we talked about. So I think that's why we're prudently trying to create a range that acknowledges we're early in the year and early in, trying to see some of the recovery in some of these more cyclical macro items. \nSeth Sigman: Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then my follow-up, as you think about online sales growth seem to outpace store comps very slightly but for the first time since 2020. And I appreciate the role that stores and online both play in driving a seamless transaction. But I'm just curious, anything notable that you're seeing as it relates to consumer behavior across the channels? And how does that tie in with your store closure plans? \nCorie Barry: I think we've had a pretty consistent view on the fact that we believe online penetration -- we kind of said we'll first stabilize because it went so high during the pandemic, we knew there'd be some level of pullback. And the last -- I'm going to call it like 18 months have been a little bit more around, where does it stabilize, particularly as a percent of our overall revenue.\n And that, for the last year, has been a little bit more stable year-over-year in terms of penetration of digital sales. But our forward-looking hypothesis has been that at a more normalized pace, we probably continue to see online penetration continues to increase.\n Now you led in with what I want to remind everyone, which is this is not a channel that is taken alone in and of itself. The other interesting fact that we laid out in the prepared remarks is that 44% of what we sell online is still picked up in a store. And that number was consistent year-over-year, even though we're shipping faster and we talked about our ability to ship in 2 days even faster than the year before.\n And so for our model, in particular, there is this really important interplay between the digital sales, even as they keep penetrating, and the convenience and the ability to ubiquitously search online but also go into the store, if I would like to, regardless of where I choose to make the purchase, which is why we are moving at a methodical pace, I would say, in terms of the evolution of our store footprint.\n And that's why I also believe this year, our focus is more on touching as many stores as we can and making sure that, that shopping experience feels good, carefully thinking about what the right portfolio looks like over the longer period. And I think Matt and the team have done a really nice job continuing to make sure we are in the right places at the right time and then testing our way into what we think the right footprint of the future is.\n Because it's just not as easy as, is it stores or is it online? It really is the interplay between the 2 uniquely, I would argue, for us as a consumer electronic specialty retailer. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Katharine McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Just back to the comp range, I was wondering how we should think about traffic versus ticket when it comes to the down 3% to flat. It seems like there are some moving parts in ticket, and we just wanted to better understand the dynamic of maybe some pressure on prices versus mix. \nMatthew Bilunas: Yes. Sure, Kate. When you think about it in the next year, I think what we've been seeing, if I look just back at last year, we saw our average selling prices be a little more pressured in the -- a little bit in the first part of the year and then it started to stabilize in Q3, and in Q4, in fact, our average selling price was up compared to last year. And some of that was this unit mix that we talked about. As well as we look to next year, we clearly are trying to see both -- some level of ASP stabilization, some unit growth, which is why we've seen such a promotional environment to kind of stimulate the unit side of this equation.\n And so I think it all kind of obviously depends by category. And I think the carriers are at somewhat different phases in their -- where is the right ASP to drive the right type of unit velocity. And so I think probably somewhat, I would guess, next year similar to what we've seen this year. There could be quarters where you see a little ASP pressure, a little bit more coming from units and vice versa. So hard to know exactly by quarter, but it's probably nothing too dissimilar from what we've seen in the last year. \nKatharine McShane: Okay. And our second question was just on the usage of your credit cards, if you're seeing anything different. Or did you see anything change in the fourth quarter in terms of frequency or size of transaction? \nMatthew Bilunas: No, nothing really different in terms of usage. It's still an amazing offering for us. We have about 25% of our sales transacted on our card, which has been pretty consistent for the past 5 years. Last year, it was still 1.4% of our domestic sales similar to FY '23. So nothing too different in terms of the usage. And in fact, we still see a continued level of our card being used for external purchases. That's been growing over the last number of years. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. \nGregory Melich: I wanted to follow up on membership and services. Could you give us an update there in terms of either household or a number of members or what percentage of services revenues are there and what behavior you're seeing? \nCorie Barry: Yes. We haven't explicitly broken out the percent of services, that is, membership. But we did say we now have 7 million members, and that is compared to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During Q4, we actually signed up 35% more paid members compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So remember that we have a new tier in there. So we have the My Total and the My Best Buy Plus. And so that has driven some growth. And I think it's important to remember, our goal here is to drive engagement and increased share of wallet.\n And what we do is we're doing that across 3 main aspects. You hit on acquisition. But there's also -- we talked on the call about engagement and retention. And I think we're happy because, right now, our paid members continue to interact with the brand more frequently compared to nonmembers.\n And in addition, as we've been analyzing incremental spend that says -- based on data from Circana that indicates that our Total Tech members are shifting their share of wallet to us as well.\n So it's not just about how many of them are using services but it's also about how frequently are they interacting with the brand? And are we keeping them loyal to the Best Buy brand. And I think we're happy, again, with what we're seeing so far there and making good progress. We haven't yet lapped the new rollout. So we still have a little bit of time to understand just how well we're doing in that vein. But right now, we're really happy with our ability to acquire members. \nMatthew Bilunas: And maybe just for a little additional context, the services growth you see at 6% in Q4, that growth was driven more by increased revenue collected from our installation business. As Corie mentioned, we've shifted -- we've changed our membership program. So we're seeing more of that revenue growth now come off the installation revenue that we're now collecting because it's no longer part of the benefits of Total Tech.\n And so although we're growing more members, the price point is changing a bit. So you see more growth coming from the insulation business from a dollar perspective than you would have seen in previous quarters. \nGregory Melich: Great. And then my follow-up is on that is really -- I think you mentioned that ad expense or marketing expense will be up $50 million this year. Could you just say what that's on? And I'm curious, are there any efforts to use all -- the data that you're getting, whether it's from your members or just customers in general, to maybe get some revenue from all that data and insight? \nMatthew Bilunas: Sure. I'll start, and then Corie can jump on the last part of the question. I think overall, we're adding about $50 million of advertising expense this year. It's for a number of different things, and I'll give you a couple of items. First, we are expecting a brand relaunch in the back half of this year. So some of this money is used for some additional branding spend that we have. I would say also this is a very unique year in terms of we have things like the Olympics and presidential election. So the inflation on marketing actually comes up in these periods of time, which is part of that increase.\n We are also trying to ensure that we are positioned right across our key categories and making sure we have the right amount of low funnel marketing spend pointed at growing our categories when we need to. So I think it's a collection of those things that I would explain. It all adds up to that $50 million. So again, positioning ourselves for a great stabilization and growth in the future and making sure we're in the market in the right spots. \nCorie Barry: And I love the question about data. It's one of the most powerful tools we have in terms of how we reach our customers. And so we have a Best Buy Ads business. That continues to grow top line collections and profitability and it's been outpacing our core business, I think, as you would expect.\n And I think it's important to know, this isn't new for us. I mean, at Best Buy we've had very close partnerships with our vendors for a very long time in terms of our advertising. It has gotten more scientific. It has gotten a lot more personalized. And I think that first-party data that we have is much more powerful than it has ever been historically.\n And obviously, we can also leverage our strong share position in places like even smart TV where we do have established relationships and partnerships with both Amazon on Fire TV and Roku. And so we also have partnerships that allow us to partner on those leading streaming platforms, and we can grow that advertising business and deliver even more value to our vendor partners through some of the partnerships we have uniquely there. So you're right, the data that we have stretches, not only on our own platforms like the app, but stretches into how uniquely we can serve those customers. \nOperator: Today's final question will come from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. \nJoseph Feldman: I want to follow up, can you share a little more color on the store refreshes and what we should expect to see over the course of the year as you do touch up the stores and maybe make them a little more engaging from a merchandising standpoint? \nCorie Barry: Yes, absolutely. Let me start with, to be clear, we're not remodeling every store in the fleet. So I have to be clear there. But what we are doing is taking, I would argue, kind of a stronger position than we ever have to ensure that the shopping experience reflects that kind of excitement and that sparkle that technology brings to life.\n So we've given examples before like some of the investments that we are making in our end caps and those vendor experiences that you see throughout the store, super important positions in the store because they tend to be the most customer facing. And so you're going to see us continue to bring those to life.\n I think you're also going to see us rightsize a number of the categories and that's particular emphasis on that center of the store area because we want that excitement. We want that relevancy. We also want to be efficient for our associates. And so we're moving physical media, updating mobile, digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home, things that allows us to make that center of the store really feel a bit more vibrant and exciting.\n And so the goal here is not that every single store is going to look like an experience store. The goal though is that every single one has a bit of a refreshed look and feel, has more of those vendor partnership opportunities and has a better ability for our associates to merchandise in a way that makes everything feel kind of full and exciting.\n And with that -- do you have a follow-up, Joe, sorry? \nJoseph Feldman: No, no, no, that's good. We can end it there. \nCorie Barry: No, no problem. Thanks for the question. And with that, that was our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. We look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in May. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Before getting into our quarterly results, let me start by sharing a few details on the extra week that occurred in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra week added approximately $735 million in enterprise revenue and approximately $0.30 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the quarter. Also as a reminder, revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculation.\n Next, I will share details on the fourth quarter results including the extra week. Enterprise revenue of $14.6 billion declined 4.8% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% improved 20 basis points compared to last year and included a 50 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate.\n Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $30 million higher than last year and increased approximately 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.72.\n When viewing our performance compared to our expectations, revenue was near the midpoint of our guidance. As Corie mentioned, our comparable sales trends were not linear, with the more traditional holiday shopping days being our strongest from a growth perspective. Our comparable sales by month were November, down 5%; December, down 2%; and January, down 12%.\n Although our sales were near the midpoint of our guidance, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% was at the high end. Our gross profit rate was higher than we expected, primarily driven by a more favorable gross profit rate in our services category, which includes our membership offerings. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense was near the high end of our expectations due to additional incentive compensation.\n Next, I will walk through the details of our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 0.9% to $13.4 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.1% and was partially offset by approximately $675 million in revenue from the extra week. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were home theater, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, which were partially offset by growth in gaming.\n From organic's perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was slightly higher than last year. The growth was primarily due to an increased mix of units coming from higher ticket items such as notebooks and TVs, even though the individual ASPs for both of those categories were down year-over-year.\n International revenue of $1.2 billion increased 2.7%, primarily driven by approximately $60 million of revenue from the extra week, which was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.4%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 60 basis points to 20.4%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvements from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category.\n In addition, the higher gross profit rate from our Best Buy Health initiatives also contributed to the improved rate. The previous items were partially offset by lower product margin rates.\n Consistent with the third quarter, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction to cost of sales last year. We anticipate a similar recognition of this funding in the first half of fiscal '25 or approximately $20 million a quarter.\n Moving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $17 million, which was primarily driven by the extra week and higher incentive compensation, which were partially offset by lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising expense. Our International non-GAAP SG&A increased $13 million, which was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and the extra week.\n In the fourth quarter, as Corie alluded to, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs. The related actions span multiple areas across our organization and include approximately $65 million for actions that won't be implemented until fiscal '26.\n Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 4% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory.\n During fiscal '24, our total capital expenditures were $795 million versus $930 million in fiscal '23. The largest drivers of the year-over-year decline was a reduction in store-related investments. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n Moving on to our full year fiscal '25 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%, which compares to an estimated 4% non-GAAP operating income rate for fiscal '24 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20.\n In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million to $800 million. And lastly, we expect to spend approximately $350 million on share repurchases, which is similar to our fiscal '24 spend.\n Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance. As our ongoing practice, we will continue to close existing traditional stores during our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. In fiscal '24, we closed 24 stores. And in fiscal '25, we expect to close 10 to 15 stores.\n Earlier, Corie provided context on our fiscal '25 top line assumptions. Let me spend more time on the profitability outlook. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 20 to 30 basis points compared to fiscal '24 due to the following actions and initiatives.\n First, continued profitability improvements of our services and membership offerings is expected to provide approximately 45 basis points of gross profit rate expansion. The achievement of this improvement essentially recoups the original investment of our previous Total Tech offering that was scaled nationally in October of 2021.\n The expected rate improvement is due to higher revenue from installation and delivery services, which were previously included benefits of paid membership and a lower cost to serve due to lower expected volume for in-home installation and other related services. The unit volume of these services is still expected to be above pre-pandemic levels but below the elevated levels we experienced when Total Tech members receive them as a benefit at no incremental cost. We also expect Best Buy Health to add a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to our enterprise profit -- gross profit rate on a year-over-year basis.\n Partially offsetting the previous items is approximately 20 basis points expected pressure from a lower profit share on a credit card arrangement. In fiscal '24, our profit share was approximately 1.4% of domestic revenue, consistent with fiscal '23. The expected pressure in fiscal '25 is primarily due to expected increases in net credit losses. This estimate does not include implications from any proposed changes to late fee regulation. We also expect that our product margin rates will experience slight pressure.\n Now moving to our SG&A expectations. The high end of our guidance assumes SG&A dollars are similar to fiscal '24, which includes the following puts and takes. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high end of our guidance assuming an increase of $40 million compared to fiscal '24. We expect advertising expense to increase by approximately $50 million.\n Partially offsetting previous items is the benefit of 1 less week, which is estimated at approximately $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends.\n Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 5%, which aligns with our estimated February performance. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 first quarter rate of 3.4%.\n We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, in line with the 20 to 30 basis point improvement we are expecting for the full year. SG&A dollars are expected to decline as a percentage in the low single-digit range with the decrease primarily due to lower store payroll expense.\n I will now turn the call over to operator for questions. Yes, Michael, I'll take that. I think if I look at just going forward in an ideal setting, when you get past the flat to slightly down year this year, we do expect when you look out into the next number of years that the industry will continue to grow and that we will grow along with it.\n I think it is our expectation that we will continue to grow sales. It's our expectation that we will continue to expand our operating profit rate as we do that. And to your point, part of that is we expect to be able to leverage on SG&A and take advantage of not just all the initiatives that are adding to our improvements over this last year, but also just a good focus on cost control and efficiency.\n And so I think by that center, I'm not going to give you a specific how much does rate improve by every point of comp. But it would be our expectation as we grow a few percentage points, we will be able to expand our rate.\n And I think year-to-year, I think that takes on a little different color as you think about one given year and you move into next year with a different level of operating revenue with a consistent level of cost structure. You can imagine that it does help expand your rate a little bit more as you go from one year to the next. Yes. Sure, Kate. When you think about it in the next year, I think what we've been seeing, if I look just back at last year, we saw our average selling prices be a little more pressured in the -- a little bit in the first part of the year and then it started to stabilize in Q3, and in Q4, in fact, our average selling price was up compared to last year. And some of that was this unit mix that we talked about. As well as we look to next year, we clearly are trying to see both -- some level of ASP stabilization, some unit growth, which is why we've seen such a promotional environment to kind of stimulate the unit side of this equation.\n And so I think it all kind of obviously depends by category. And I think the carriers are at somewhat different phases in their -- where is the right ASP to drive the right type of unit velocity. And so I think probably somewhat, I would guess, next year similar to what we've seen this year. There could be quarters where you see a little ASP pressure, a little bit more coming from units and vice versa. So hard to know exactly by quarter, but it's probably nothing too dissimilar from what we've seen in the last year. No, nothing really different in terms of usage. It's still an amazing offering for us. We have about 25% of our sales transacted on our card, which has been pretty consistent for the past 5 years. Last year, it was still 1.4% of our domestic sales similar to FY '23. So nothing too different in terms of the usage. And in fact, we still see a continued level of our card being used for external purchases. That's been growing over the last number of years. And maybe just for a little additional context, the services growth you see at 6% in Q4, that growth was driven more by increased revenue collected from our installation business. As Corie mentioned, we've shifted -- we've changed our membership program. So we're seeing more of that revenue growth now come off the installation revenue that we're now collecting because it's no longer part of the benefits of Total Tech.\n And so although we're growing more members, the price point is changing a bit. So you see more growth coming from the insulation business from a dollar perspective than you would have seen in previous quarters. Sure. I'll start, and then Corie can jump on the last part of the question. I think overall, we're adding about $50 million of advertising expense this year. It's for a number of different things, and I'll give you a couple of items. First, we are expecting a brand relaunch in the back half of this year. So some of this money is used for some additional branding spend that we have. I would say also this is a very unique year in terms of we have things like the Olympics and presidential election. So the inflation on marketing actually comes up in these periods of time, which is part of that increase.\n We are also trying to ensure that we are positioned right across our key categories and making sure we have the right amount of low funnel marketing spend pointed at growing our categories when we need to. So I think it's a collection of those things that I would explain. It all adds up to that $50 million. So again, positioning ourselves for a great stabilization and growth in the future and making sure we're in the market in the right spots."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm proud of the performance of our teams across the company as they showed resourcefulness, passion and unwavering focus on our customers this past year. Throughout fiscal '24, we demonstrated strong operational execution as we navigated a pressured CE sales environment. This allowed us to deliver annual profitability at the high end of our original guidance range even though sales came in below our original guidance range. Importantly, we grew our paid membership base and drove customer experience improvements in many areas of our business, particularly in services and delivery.\n For Q4 specifically, we are reporting profitability at the high end of our expectations, with revenue near the middle of our guidance range. Our comparable sales declined 4.8% in the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our gross profit rate 50 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program as well as Best Buy Health.\n Excluding the impact of the extra week, we lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations. As expected, customers were very deal-focused through the holiday season, and the promotional environment overall was in line with our expectations. While shopping patterns more closely resembled historical holiday periods and Black Friday and Cyber Week performances were in line with our expectations, the sales lull in December was even steeper than we had modeled. Then customer demand strengthened considerably and was higher than we expected during the 4 days before Christmas.\n Our Q4 digital sales mix was flat to last year at 38% of total domestic sales. Customer in-store pickup of online orders was also consistent at 44%. We improved our delivery speeds, expanding the percent of ship-to-home online orders delivered in 2 days. We have been very focused on getting our app in the hands of customers. And I'm pleased to say that on Black Friday, it ranked #3 across shopping apps and #4 across all apps on Apple's App Store.\n We ended the quarter and year with 7 million members across our 2-tiered My Best Buy paid memberships. Paid members consistently showed higher levels of interaction with comparatively higher levels of spend at Best Buy and a shift of spend away from competitors. From a financial perspective, membership delivered another quarter of higher-than-expected operating income rate contribution. When you include the changes we made to the free tier and the impact of the midyear changes we made to the paid program benefits, our membership program contributed approximately 45 basis points of enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion for the full year.\n And our Best Buy Health business achieved its operating income contribution target of 10 basis points for the year. In addition, we announced strategic partnerships with Advocate Health, Geisinger Health and Mass General Brigham, and our care at home platform is now being used in 8 of the top 20 health systems in the U.S.\n Now I would like to look forward to fiscal '25. We expect this to be a year of increasing industry stabilization. Our strategy is to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding, our operating income rate on a 52-week basis.\n Therefore, our fiscal '25 priorities are as follows: one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore, pilot and drive incremental revenue streams.\n There's a lot to unpack. I'll start with a discussion about the macro environment, the CE industry and our sales expectations. At the highest level, there have been and continue to be macro pressures impacting retail overall and CE more specifically.\n First, inflation has been slowing, but prices for the basics like food and lodging are still much higher and consumers have to prioritize and make trade-off spend decisions. Second, there is a consumer propensity to spend on services like concerts and vacations in lieu of goods, which has remained sticky even as the prices there too have inflated.\n Third, we have a relatively stagnant housing market. Fourth, CE was a significant recipient of a pull forward of demand during the first 2 years of the pandemic. When consumers need to prioritize the basics that usually does not include the product purchases they recently pulled forward. And lastly, the level of CE product innovation has been lowered during the pandemic and supply chain challenged years.\n It's not so much about each of these individually, but when you stack the five, it has been a heavy weight on the industry. On the positive side, experience tells us that these are all cyclical and transient in nature. And while they are ebbing and flowing, we are optimistic that several indicators will continue to show favorability this year. These include decreasing inflation leading to the lowering of interest rates, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound.\n We remain confident that our industry will grow again after 2 years of declines. This is simply a matter of the timing. Our underlying thesis is consistent. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products in consumers' homes.\n Second, we expect to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bot early in the pandemic kick in this year and into the next few years. Third, we are returning to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation after a pause during the pandemic.\n Taking all these factors and considerations into account, we expect fiscal '25 comparable sales to be flat to last year on the high end of our guidance range, down in the first half and up in the second half of the year. The low end of our annual comp sales range is a decline of 3%, reflecting a scenario where the mix of the factors I just discussed results in lower customer demand.\n From a category standpoint, we expect sales in our computing category to improve through the year and show growth for the full year as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We are already beginning to see the improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter and are trending positively so far this quarter.\n At this point in time, we expect revenue for the rest of our product categories to stabilize through the year and be flattish to slightly down for the full year, partially offset by the continued growth of our services revenue.\n Even though overall, we are expecting flattish sales growth for the full year, there are many examples of innovation both already introduced and expected through the year that we believe will drive interest including the Samsung AI-enabled phone we are already seeing materially more demand than we expected, new emerging content for VR/AR devices, Ray-Ban smart glasses, Bose open year headphones, EV universal charging devices and a proliferation of 98-inch screen TVs, to name a few.\n Also, the level of exciting and cool new tech at the Consumer Electronics Show in January felt back to normal. Of course, some of that cool new tech hits the market over the following year while some of it is still a few years from consumer launch.\n Now I would like to provide more details on some of the key initiatives within each of our fiscal '25 priorities to capitalize on that industry stability. As I mentioned, our first priority is to invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences. Our first initiative is to materially elevate personalization. We are focused on providing increasingly personalized, highly relevant and motivational content for our known identified customers. We can attribute roughly 90% of our annual revenue to known customers.\n Let's start with our efforts around our paid membership program. Here, we're creating seamless, tailored experiences for our members based on their unique preferences or context. Our app first member deals experience is a great example of this. Rather than bombarding our members with thousands of great member deals, we focus on the experience on the most relevant offers based on their preferences and observed member data.\n Additionally, we're adding personalization across the membership journey, including in-store at POS, where later this year will include props to provide both sales associates and customers with relevant contextual information about their membership like their savings, rewards, protection plans and offers. We will also include personalized dynamic messaging in our communications to members about their upcoming program renewals. These efforts and more will serve to increase membership engagement and continue to improve retention.\n As we think about our broader known customer base, we are fortunate to have a tremendous amount of first-party customer data for our advanced analytics capabilities to leverage. While we are elevating personalization across our customer interactions, I'm particularly excited about the work we are doing with our app. We are currently testing a personalization-centric version of the app homepage with the stories and actions that matter most to customers, along with critical content and plan to launch to all customers during the second quarter.\n The second initiative is to invest back into our store experience. Our stores are crucial assets that provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and convenient multichannel fulfillment. Customer shopping behavior has evolved in the last 4 years. And this year, we are particularly focused on ensuring we provide the experience that customers expect to have when they take the time to come into our stores.\n As a result, our capital investments for fiscal '25 are concentrated more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels or store openings. We plan to touch every single store in the chain in some fashion, improving both our merchandising and ease of shopping for customers.\n This includes improving and livening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the sales floor. It also includes rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we're leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. For example, we will be removing physical media and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home departments.\n We are also excited to partner even more with our vendors this year as it relates to their branded in-store merchandise experiences. The coming innovation, combined with our plan to refresh every store in our fleet, provides much more opportunity for vendor investments in our stores. A few examples I can share at this time include Tesla, LoveSac and Starlink.\n Although we still see opportunities for additional large experienced store remodels, we believe we have a better opportunity to improve existing store experiences at scale in fiscal '25. At the same time, we are planning to open a few additional outlet centers and new formats to continue to test 2 important concepts.\n First, we will open small locations in a couple of out state markets where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low to measure our ability to capture untapped share. Second, we will test our ability to close a large format store and open a small format store nearby, thereby maximizing physical store retention through convenience. These learnings will collectively continue to help us refine our forward-looking store strategy.\n In addition to a great physical experience, we want to ensure our customers receive the expert service interactions they want and Best Buy is known for when they come to our stores. During fiscal '25, we will continue to leverage our multiskilled store associates, but in hundreds of stores we will also add back fully dedicated expertise in key categories like major appliances, home theater and computing.\n Our plan is to deploy some of our most skilled sellers against these categories and double down on category-specific training and certifications for these employees. We know that our selling certifications create a better experience for our customers as our certified employees on average drive nearly 15% higher revenue per transaction and garner higher Net Promoter Scores than a noncertified employee.\n In fact, the third initiative under our drive targeted customer experiences priority is to make sure we are prepared to bring coming innovation to life for customers in ways no one else can. This means we need to be ready to leverage the unique strengths that make us the best place for customers to see new tech and the best partner for vendors to launch NewTek.\n This includes everything from expertly trained associates who can explain the new technology and what it can do for you, the best merchandising presentation both in-store and online, all the way to great trade-in values for customers who use technology. This will be particularly important later this year when more computing products featuring AI are expected to launch.\n As a reminder, we hold 1/3 of the retail market share in both the U.S. computing and television industries, roughly 20% in gaming and well over 10% share in other categories like major appliances. We intend to strengthen our position in these key categories through the initiatives I just outlined as well as pointed marketing spend and sharp pricing.\n Our second key priority for the year is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. We have a longstanding commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies to help offset inflationary pressures in our business and fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives.\n Our fiscal '25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely and effectively.\n Let me provide a few specific examples of how we are leveraging it. One, we're using AI to route our in-home delivery and installation trucks to drive more efficient scheduling and a better customer experience. Two, we are leveraging AI to summarize the main points and follow-ups from each of our customer service calls. It also improves the accuracy of the interaction and data collection while reducing average engagement time by almost 5%.\n To help us enhance our overall tech development effectiveness we are leveraging gen AI code generation and shared resources for our engineers. We are also establishing a digital and technology hub in Bangalore, India, which will give us expanded, more economical access to talent and skills. The hub will open and begin the process of onboarding team members later this year.\n In addition, in fiscal '25, we are taking actions to, one, ensure our resources are directed at the right strategic areas; and two, to rightsize our model based on current operations. These actions will allow us to do the following: balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop, redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago. whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits.\n While we made these decisions during the fourth quarter, which resulted in a restructuring charge that Matt will discuss later, many of the actions will be implemented through the first half of fiscal '25 and we will provide more details as we move through the year.\n Our third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. This will include striking the appropriate balance of prioritizing areas that best position us for the future while prudently dealing with the near-term uncertainty in the CE industry. There are a few key points that I want to highlight.\n First, as it relates to our capital allocation strategy, our overall approach isn't changing. We still plan to first fund operations and investments in areas necessary to grow our business, and next, return excess free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n Second, while our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal '25 are planned at a similar level to last year, our Domestic segment capital expenditures are expected to decline by approximately $50 million due to the store portfolio investment approach I discussed earlier and lower technology-related expense. This is offset by a year-over-year planned increase in CapEx in Canada to reflect investments for new stores and necessary supply chain automation projects.\n Third, and consistent with our practice over the past several years, we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. Our teams have done a tremendous job managing our inventory in a very uneven sales environment, keeping inventory aligned with our forward-looking sales projections while, at the same time, maintaining as much flexibility as possible. And lastly, this morning, we announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. This represents the 11th straight year of dividend increases and puts our current dividend yield near 5%.\n Our fourth key priority for fiscal '25 is longer term in focus. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams over time. The most developed example of this is Best Buy Health, where we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad agents to capitalize on the growing use of technology to help provide health care in the home.\n While still very small in relation to our core business, our fiscal '25 Best Buy Health sales are expected to grow faster than the core business, which, combined with cost synergies from fully integrating acquired companies, are expected to drive another 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion.\n Another example is our recently announced collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 165 small-format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada. These stores, previously known as The Source, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada, will be rebranded as Best Buy Express. We will provide the CE assortment as well as supply chain, marketing and e-commerce.\n Bell will continue to be the exclusive telecommunication services provider and will also be responsible for the store operating costs and labor components of the partnership. This collaboration will allow us to expand our presence in malls and in smaller and midsized communities across Canada. Best Buy Express stores are expected to roll out during the second half of this year.\n Other examples of opportunities we are pursuing include continuing to build out our business case for Geek Squad as a service and adding vendors to our supply chain partner plus program.\n Before I close and turn the call over to Matt, I wanted to touch on a few of the ways we are being recognized for the support we provide to our employees and communities. From an employee standpoint, I'm proud to share that we continue to maintain industry low turnover rates and our fiscal '24 employee turnover was down on a year-over-year basis.\n To that end, this is our second year as the #1 retailer on the Just Capital List, which evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., in part on how a company invests in its workforce. This year will also mark the fifth anniversary of our caregiver pay benefit. During that time, we've supported 22,000 employees with almost 3 million hours of time away, so they could care for those who matter most.\n We continue to be credited as a leader in sustainability. In Q4, for the 13th year, we were named to the annual Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We were also just named for the seventh consecutive year, to the CDP's prestigious Climate A List, which looks at how organizations demonstrate best practices associated with environmental leadership.\n In summary, we are focused and energized about delivering on our purpose to Enrich Lives through Technology in a vibrant, always changing industry. We don't assort tech products just for the sake of technology. We see technology and service of humans. And as the largest CE specialty retailer with our unique range of product assortment and expert services, we deliver that human experience to millions of customers.\n I want to reiterate our fiscal '25 strategy in what we expect to be a year of increasing industry stabilization we are focused on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. We are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal '25 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income rate.\n I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q4 financial performance and our outlook. I wish there was an exact science to this one. That being said, we did try to give you in the prepared remarks a few indicators that we're seeing that say we might be starting to get into that replacement cycle. We talked specifically about laptop units returning to growth in Q4 and that trend continuing here as we head into Q1. That, to me, feels like an early indicator of at least some foray into that replacement cycle.\n Because honestly, really, right now, there isn't any massive current innovation that would spur you to go buy a new laptop. There's a little bit but we're expecting more as the year goes on. And then obviously, that -- the laptop category would be kind of earlier in the realm of replacement cycles that we've talked about.\n So I think you're starting to see some goodness there, Scot, which makes me think a little bit more of the overhang that we're seeing is that kind of combo batter of 5 macro factors that I talked about that continue to weigh on the industry and haven't abated nearly to the pace that I think anyone thought from a macro perspective. I think what's important is to differentiate purchase frequency from the frequency of interacting with the brand. And we have the luxury because we do know -- like I said, 90% of our purchasing customers we can identify, we can actually see many behaviors. And people don't just come to us because they want to make a purchase.\n There's a lot of research done in the category. There are repairs done in the category. There are curiosity about upgrades done in the category. And so we do see enough frequency of visits and our ability to understand how the consumer is acting that do allow us to make those personalizations.\n And that's why one of the things that we mentioned and why we try to get really specific examples is in the app, having that personalized front page means we're not just targeting you for what you might purchase next. We're literally trying to figure out your next best action, and that action might just be discovery.\n You might just want to come and scroll through and take a look at what's new or what's coming and educate yourself. And we will gladly help you do that. And so I think the next realm of personalization -- I think personalization often gets lumped in with purchase. And it's for us, in particular, because we really deal with the full life cycle of how people use these products, it's a lot broader than that. Yes. I will give you my very best qualitative answer here. I think if you followed what happened at the Consumer Electronics Show in January at all, it was, I would argue, the largest foray into how AI will impact our world going forward from here, particularly as it relates to consumer electronics.\n And I think in the coming year, there's enough noise out there that you can get this feel that you're going to start to see the computing side of this really start to take light and make it easier and more seamless for everyone to be able to use tools that will help them be more efficient and effective.\n But the horizon question, and that's how I like to think about it, I like to think about it as the kind of innovation horizon, I think, is really vibrant right now in terms of what AI technology might be able to do. Because it's not just compute. It gets into like how smart can I make the things around me.\n And one of the other things that's really interesting about AI is it actually makes consumer electronics products more human. And so there's this question of how do I make these CE products interact with me more seamlessly?\n How are the robots that are in my house even smarter because they can triangulate faster and they just get smarter on their own? So my little robot vacuum gets smarter every single time that I use it, right?\n And so these aren't just innovations in the compute side of things. You're starting to see it in the phone side of things. You're starting to see it and how far can we kind of push the envelope on what consumer electronics can do for you in your home to just make your home life more seamless.\n So I'm not saying it's going to be a revolution overnight, Brian, to be clear. But I do definitely see more excitement and kind of this unlock in how technology can fit even more seamlessly into your life. I wouldn't say there's more. I mean, I think when we were headed into holiday, we said this is typically a category that is promotional. It's typically a category that many different partners play in for the holiday because whether or not it blew the doors off, it is always a category that people look for as it relates to holiday. And so I think you always see some players come in and out of the space as it relates to gifting and CE as a gift. And I -- my personal point of view, didn't see more than we would have expected this holiday than any other.\n Obviously, we're always watching the competitive landscape. But I think that's why we're really focused in the coming year on our unique positioning in the CE landscape and the both pre-purchase and then post-purchase offerings that we have that are pretty unique in the marketplace, no matter who enters it. Yes. So let me start a little near term and then I'll work my way back to a little bit longer term. You're right, there have been a number of strategic pivots in the model. And to be clear, this is in service of bolstering our position in the market. That is why we are making the changes that we are, and it's also in service of a changing consumer who expects a different experience. So we've said it many times, Michael, and I know you're familiar. There isn't a great single source of share here for consumer electronics because nobody covers all the categories that we do.\n But for the Circana track categories, which represent about 70% of our revenue, we held share in Q4 and for the full year, year-over-year. With the same caveats as I think about the last several years, and this is one we have to try to analyze multiple sources over a longer-term period. We believe we've actually largely held share in the key categories since the beginning of the pandemic.\n Like I said, it is a difficult science because there are so many different sources. But you can imagine, as you started with the question, strategically, we are incredibly focused on those real key categories that are important and underline our strategy to really kind of own that home experience and that CE experience end-to-end for our consumers.\n So we are tracking this carefully, and I can promise you that the changes to the model are not for the fun of it. The changes are definitely in service of different customer expectations and our commitment to hold position in this industry. You said it very well. It's not a perfect correlation with our business, the housing market, I mean. But there are definitely pieces of the business that tend to correlate more highly, particularly as you think about appliances, and then somewhat as you kind of creep into television. Those tend to be the areas that are most highly correlated. In the prepared remarks, I talked about that kind of stacked macro pressures on CE.\n And then alluded to the fact that the high end of the range at a flat comp for the year, we're assuming that a few of these in particular start to abate. You're starting to see inflation pull back a bit, that one is important. And also, you are starting to at least see the -- what I'd like to call the green shoots of the housing market maybe start to turn in a bit more positive direction.\n So I would assume that in that -- again, at that top end of the guide that we were talking about, we continue to maybe see a bit of that slow progression of improvement.\n There is nothing that would say we expect changes overnight. There's nothing that would say we expect all of a sudden, it's all sunshine and roses in the housing market. But I think in general, we're starting to see enough of the green shoots that make you feel like, yes, there might be a bit of improvement there that helps buoy at least that part of the business.\n That being said, we also said on the downside scenario at a down 3% comp maybe don't see the level of recovery in any of those macro factors that we talked about. So I think that's why we're prudently trying to create a range that acknowledges we're early in the year and early in, trying to see some of the recovery in some of these more cyclical macro items. I think we've had a pretty consistent view on the fact that we believe online penetration -- we kind of said we'll first stabilize because it went so high during the pandemic, we knew there'd be some level of pullback. And the last -- I'm going to call it like 18 months have been a little bit more around, where does it stabilize, particularly as a percent of our overall revenue.\n And that, for the last year, has been a little bit more stable year-over-year in terms of penetration of digital sales. But our forward-looking hypothesis has been that at a more normalized pace, we probably continue to see online penetration continues to increase.\n Now you led in with what I want to remind everyone, which is this is not a channel that is taken alone in and of itself. The other interesting fact that we laid out in the prepared remarks is that 44% of what we sell online is still picked up in a store. And that number was consistent year-over-year, even though we're shipping faster and we talked about our ability to ship in 2 days even faster than the year before.\n And so for our model, in particular, there is this really important interplay between the digital sales, even as they keep penetrating, and the convenience and the ability to ubiquitously search online but also go into the store, if I would like to, regardless of where I choose to make the purchase, which is why we are moving at a methodical pace, I would say, in terms of the evolution of our store footprint.\n And that's why I also believe this year, our focus is more on touching as many stores as we can and making sure that, that shopping experience feels good, carefully thinking about what the right portfolio looks like over the longer period. And I think Matt and the team have done a really nice job continuing to make sure we are in the right places at the right time and then testing our way into what we think the right footprint of the future is.\n Because it's just not as easy as, is it stores or is it online? It really is the interplay between the 2 uniquely, I would argue, for us as a consumer electronic specialty retailer. Yes. We haven't explicitly broken out the percent of services, that is, membership. But we did say we now have 7 million members, and that is compared to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During Q4, we actually signed up 35% more paid members compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So remember that we have a new tier in there. So we have the My Total and the My Best Buy Plus. And so that has driven some growth. And I think it's important to remember, our goal here is to drive engagement and increased share of wallet.\n And what we do is we're doing that across 3 main aspects. You hit on acquisition. But there's also -- we talked on the call about engagement and retention. And I think we're happy because, right now, our paid members continue to interact with the brand more frequently compared to nonmembers.\n And in addition, as we've been analyzing incremental spend that says -- based on data from Circana that indicates that our Total Tech members are shifting their share of wallet to us as well.\n So it's not just about how many of them are using services but it's also about how frequently are they interacting with the brand? And are we keeping them loyal to the Best Buy brand. And I think we're happy, again, with what we're seeing so far there and making good progress. We haven't yet lapped the new rollout. So we still have a little bit of time to understand just how well we're doing in that vein. But right now, we're really happy with our ability to acquire members. And I love the question about data. It's one of the most powerful tools we have in terms of how we reach our customers. And so we have a Best Buy Ads business. That continues to grow top line collections and profitability and it's been outpacing our core business, I think, as you would expect.\n And I think it's important to know, this isn't new for us. I mean, at Best Buy we've had very close partnerships with our vendors for a very long time in terms of our advertising. It has gotten more scientific. It has gotten a lot more personalized. And I think that first-party data that we have is much more powerful than it has ever been historically.\n And obviously, we can also leverage our strong share position in places like even smart TV where we do have established relationships and partnerships with both Amazon on Fire TV and Roku. And so we also have partnerships that allow us to partner on those leading streaming platforms, and we can grow that advertising business and deliver even more value to our vendor partners through some of the partnerships we have uniquely there. So you're right, the data that we have stretches, not only on our own platforms like the app, but stretches into how uniquely we can serve those customers. Yes, absolutely. Let me start with, to be clear, we're not remodeling every store in the fleet. So I have to be clear there. But what we are doing is taking, I would argue, kind of a stronger position than we ever have to ensure that the shopping experience reflects that kind of excitement and that sparkle that technology brings to life.\n So we've given examples before like some of the investments that we are making in our end caps and those vendor experiences that you see throughout the store, super important positions in the store because they tend to be the most customer facing. And so you're going to see us continue to bring those to life.\n I think you're also going to see us rightsize a number of the categories and that's particular emphasis on that center of the store area because we want that excitement. We want that relevancy. We also want to be efficient for our associates. And so we're moving physical media, updating mobile, digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home, things that allows us to make that center of the store really feel a bit more vibrant and exciting.\n And so the goal here is not that every single store is going to look like an experience store. The goal though is that every single one has a bit of a refreshed look and feel, has more of those vendor partnership opportunities and has a better ability for our associates to merchandise in a way that makes everything feel kind of full and exciting.\n And with that -- do you have a follow-up, Joe, sorry? No, no problem. Thanks for the question. And with that, that was our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. We look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in May. Have a great day."

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the third quarter, we are reporting better-than-expected profitability on slightly softer-than-expected revenue. Specifically, we are reporting a comparable sales decline of 6.9%, which is slightly below our outlook for the quarter as consumer demand softened through the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our Q3 gross profit rate 90 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program and better product margins. We also lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations. During the quarter, we grew our paid membership base and drove meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction scores across many of our service offerings, including in-home delivery, in-store services and remote support. Our Q3 results demonstrate our ongoing strong operational execution as we navigate through the sales pressure our industry has been experiencing for the past several quarters. The sales pressure is due to many factors, including the pandemic pull-forward of tech purchases, the shift back into services outside the home like travel and entertainment and inflation. In the more recent macro-environment, consumer demand has been even more uneven and difficult to predict. Based on the sales trends in Q3 and so far in November, we believe it is prudent to lower our revenue outlook for Q4. But despite the lowered sales outlook, the midpoint of our annual EPS guidance is now slightly higher than the midpoint of our original guidance as we entered the year. I want to thank our associates for their resilience and relentless focus on our customers. I continue to be so very proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future. Now, I would like to provide more color on our Q3 performance and holiday plans before passing the call off to Matt for the financial details on the quarter and our outlook. We continue to strategically manage our promotional plan and we're price-competitive in an environment, where consumers are very deal-focused and making spend tradeoffs right for their budget. Consumers are looking for value, and from an industry themes' perspective, we are seeing some trade-down in the television category, but not as much trade-down in other categories. As a result, and as expected, the goal of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Similar to the first half of the year, during Q3, our purchasing customers were relatively consistent in terms of demographics versus last year. As a reminder, we over-index with higher-income consumers, compared to the general population. And we saw the percent of revenue categorized as premium and the percent of purchases over $1,000 remain constant versus last year. We have largely maintained our year-to-date industry share in our Circana, formerly NPD-tracked categories. Against this backdrop, our focus on deepening relationships with customers remains crucial. Our membership program delivered another quarter of growth and improved profitability versus last year. The Q3 contribution to the enterprise operating income rate was larger-than-expected due to the combination of a lower cost to serve and higher paid in-home installation services. For the full year of fiscal '24, we now expect our three-tiered membership program to contribute approximately 35 basis points of Enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion. It is still early since we introduced material changes in June, but there are a number of insights I would like to share. One, we continue to increase our paid membership base and now have 6.6 million members. This compares to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During the third quarter, we signed up approximately 35% more new paid members compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by the addition of the new Tier and buoyed by back-to-school and October\u2019s member month events. Two, our paid members continue to interact with the brand and shop more frequently compared to non-members, which is the goal of any membership program. Three, and though it is early and we have not yet lapped the new programs, retention rates are outperforming expectations. Four, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total tech offer, continues to resonate more strongly in our physical store setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchase them. It also includes up to two years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases and includes all the benefits of My Best Buy Plus. And five, our My Best Buy Plus tier is resonating more with the digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments. This is the new tier for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60-day return and exchange window on most products. We are still early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers as well as continuously improving the digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Of course, we also have a free membership tier that enables free shipping for everyone, a great differentiator, especially in the holiday season. During the quarter, we continued to evolve our omnichannel capabilities to support our strategy and make it easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert consultation and service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Last month, we introduced Best Buy Drops, which is a new experience only available through the Best Buy app. It gives customers the opportunity to access product releases, limited edition items, launches and deals from a variety of categories. There are multiple drops nearly every week, and they're only available in limited quantities. We are encouraged by the early results as Best Buy Drops is driving both incremental customer app downloads and higher frequency of app visits. We have also seen growth in sales from customers who are getting help from our virtual sales associates. These interactions, which can be via phone, chat or our virtual store, drive much higher conversion rates and average order values than our general dot.com levels. This quarter, we had 140,000 customer interactions by a video chat with associates, specifically out of our virtual store locations. As a reminder, this is a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that are staffed with dedicated associates and no physical customers. We also teamed up with live shopping platform Talk Shop Live, to test a series of online shopping events this month, starring our virtual sales associates. These events feature products from some of our newer categories like beauty and wellness as well as new tech and unique products. Our physical store portfolio is one of our key assets, and the role of our stores is to provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need some stores to be more cost and capital efficient to operate. As a reminder, while almost one-third of our domestic sales are online, 43% of those sales were picked up in one of our stores by customers in Q3. And most customers shop us in multiple channels. Consistent with our normal cadence, we have largely completed the changes to our store portfolio for the year, so we can focus on the holiday season with minimal disruption to our physical stores. As we think about next year with the current economic backdrop, we plan to spend more of our capital expenditures refreshing a greater number of our stores and less on large-scale remodels. As such, we have three priorities for our US store fleet in the near term. Number one, we are refreshing our stores with a particular focus on improving enlivening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, this year, in all our stores, we installed new premium end caps in partnership with key vendors that improve the merchandising in the center of the store. This year, we installed up to 10 of these new end caps per store or roughly one-third of our end caps per store and plan to add more next year as we work to upgrade these crucial locations in our stores. In addition, this year, we rightsized our traditional gaming spaces in roughly half of our stores to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as Greenworks cordless power tools, wellness products like the Oura ring, Epson short throw projectors, e-bikes and scooters and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market share growth. And as always, we continue to work closely with our vendor partners to add experiences to our stores. For example, LEGO and Therabody invested in new shop-in-shops in all our 35,000 square foot experience stores. In addition, and as you would expect, many of our premium partners are continuously updating their in-store spaces to reflect their latest innovations. We will continue this work next year in all our stores, rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we are leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. Our second priority is to keep investing in formats we know drive returns. This year, we implemented 8 large format 35,000 square foot experienced store remodels for a total of 54 and will end the year with 23 outlet stores. At this point in time, we plan to implement a minimal number of remodels and outlets next year. And the third priority is to open a few smaller footprint stores to keep testing our hypothesis at physical points of presence matter, and we need less selling square footage and more fulfillment and inventory holding space. In addition, we plan to open a few smaller stores in outstate markets to test the impact of adding new locations and geographies where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low. At the same time, we also continue to close existing traditional stores as a result of our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. This year, we have closed 24 stores. Over the past five years, we have closed approximately 100 Best Buy stores, which is a 10% decline in store count during that time frame. And we expect to close roughly 15 to 20 stores per year in the near term. We have been enhancing our supply chain network to support these footprint changes and deliver speed, predictability and choice to our customers. For example, we have worked to optimize our ship-from-store hub footprint to maintain substantial coverage for faster offers and take shipping volume pressure off the majority of the stores to allow them to focus on in-store and pickup experiences. Additionally, we are optimizing our shipping locations to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness while still delivering with speed. And as a result, in Q3, we had the lowest ship from store volume as a percent of total since well before the pandemic, with approximately 62% of e-commerce small packages delivered to customers from automated distribution centers. We also continued to augment our own supply chain through other partners and launched Best Buy on DoorDash marketplace, offering our second scheduled parcel delivery option in addition to Instacart Marketplace. As we have discussed previously, we have made strategic structural changes to our store operating model over the past few years to adjust to the shifts we have seen in customer shopping behavior and our corresponding operational needs. These changes provide more flexibility and have allowed us to flex labor hours with the fluctuations in customer sales, shopping preferences like curbside and traffic. As a result, we kept our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. As you can imagine, there is a delicate balance to maintain while we adjust our store operating model as the expert service our associates provide customers is a core competitive advantage. We keep a very close watch on our customer satisfaction trends to make sure we are not negatively impacting the customer experience. Broadly, I am proud that the team is doing this work while driving higher purchasing customer NPS for associate availability, product availability and pricing. We are also committed, of course, to providing a great employee experience through training opportunities and benefits. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now led thousands of our sales associates through a certification process focused on our foundational retail excellence. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost-effective ways. A great example is our app built for employees called Solution Sidekick, that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and locations. Our employees have embraced solution Sidekick and we can see higher customer NPS when our employees are utilizing the app in their interactions with customers. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. Our average tenure, excluding our seasonal workforce, for field employees is just under five years, and our general manager tenure is almost 16 years. This is crucial as we can directly tie tenured experience and training certifications to NPS improvement over time. We have also seen a strong pool of applicants for new associates to supplement our store teams this holiday season. As you all have likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun. Since we are preparing for a customer who is very deal focused, we expect shopping patterns will look even more similar to historical holiday periods than they did last year with customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last two weeks of December. From an inventory perspective, we expect to have strong product availability across categories this year. We will continue to manage inventory strategically to maximize our ability to flex with customer demand. We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all customers and budgets, including special promotions and early access to deals for our My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members. We have curated gift list to help everyone find the perfect gift. We also introduced a new resource on bestbuy.com and the Best Buy app called Yes Best Buy Sells That, where customers can find the latest in tech and gifting, like pet tech, baby tech or electric vehicle chargers, all the way to unique products, some shoppers may not know we sell like skin treatments, toys for all ages and electric outdoor power equipment. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we've extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. And this year, for the first time, we also extended that our shoppers can connect directly with one of our virtual sales experts to get help with their holiday shopping. We're also offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items in addition to convenience store and curbside pickup options. Most orders placed on bestbuy.com or through the Best Buy app are ready for store pickup within one hour. Same-day delivery is also available on most products for a small fee. From a merchandising perspective, we're excited for shoppers to see new innovation in a variety of categories, including AI-powered devices like Microsoft CoPilot and Windows 11 computers, the latest in virtual and mixed reality with Meta Quest 3 or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, immersive audio with Bose Quiet Comfort ultra-headphones and more, and we can help our holiday shoppers take advantage of this new innovation through our trade-in program, which gives the customer value for their old technology. In addition to great deals for our flagship categories like computing, home theater and gaming, that feature our unique ability to showcase higher-end technologies at great value, we also have an expanded assortment of new and growing categories, including e-transportation, health and wellness and outdoor living. Our e-transportation assortment has more options for people of all ages and skill levels. We have twice as many outdoor cooking brands compared to last year and more than 5,000 health and wellness products, including a lineup of fitness, recovery, beauty, skin care, baby tech and more. As you can likely hear, we are very excited to provide customers an amazing experience this holiday season. Of course, the macro environment remains uncertain with some tailwinds and increasingly more headwinds, all contributing uneven impacts on consumers. The job market remains strong and upper income and older demographics, in particular, continue to benefit from excess savings. Overarchingly, the consumer is still spending. But as we have said before, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their households. Given the sustained inflationary pressure on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging and the ongoing preference towards services spending, like restaurants, concert tickets indications. Additional indicators have continued to soften, including declining consumer confidence increasing debt and waning savings, and we saw sales trends soften as we move through the quarter. This environment continues to make it challenging to predict shopping behavior even during the most exciting time of the year. While we are lowering our Q4 sales outlook, we have a wide range to allow for a number of scenarios and the mid- to high end of the range reflects sequential improvement. As we discussed on our last call, there are several factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales can improve. We expect home theater year-over-year performance to improve as we expect to be better positioned with inventory across all price points and budgets than last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our TV units as they grew in Q2 and Q3 and are expected to grow in Q4. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build on our position of strength in the premium assortment. Notebook units were flat compared to last year in Q2, down as expected in Q3 and expected to be up slightly in Q4 and we expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there are strong new software titles. In summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continues to drive volatility, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve. And we remain incredibly confident about our future opportunities. After two years of declines, we believe the consumer electronics industry should see more stabilization next year and possibly growth in the back half of the year. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years, benefiting from a materially larger installed base and the ongoing desire and need to replace technology as it ages. Much of this replacement is spurred by innovation, and in addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access and, of course, generative AI, where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant today than ever. We're the largest CE specialty retailer. We continue to hold one-third of the market share in both the US computing and television industries and we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter results our fiscal '24 outlook.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.8 billion declined 6.9% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% declined 10 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $57 million lower than last year, and it increased approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 90 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 6.5% to $1.29. When viewing our performance compared to our expectations, we did not see the sequential improvement versus the second quarter that our third quarter outlook assumed. From an enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, August decline of approximately 6% was our best performing month, with September down 7% and October down 8%. Although our sales were below plan, our non-GAAP operating income rate exceeded our outlook by approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower SG&A. The lower-than-expected SG&A was largely driven by tighter expense management in areas such as store payroll and advertising expense as we adjusted plans to account for sales trends. Our gross profit rate was essentially flat to our expectations. Lastly, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A while our outlook assumed it would have been a reduction of cost of sales. We anticipate similar recognition of this funding in Q4 in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.2% to $9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 7.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, computing, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was essentially flat to last year, which is a slight improvement relative to the past few quarters. In our International segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and a negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 22.9%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by the following. First, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Second, our product margin rates improved versus last year, including a higher level of vendor-supported promotions and the benefit from optimization efforts across multiple areas. And third, lower supply chain costs. Before moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which performed better than we expected in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the profit share has been approximately flat from a dollar perspective over the course of the year, which has resulted in a slightly positive impact to our gross profit rate. In the fourth quarter, we expect the profit share to come in better than we had expected and once again be very similar to last year from a dollar perspective. As we look to next year, we expect the credit card profit share to be a pressure to our gross profit rate. At this point in time, we expect this pressure to be offset by continued financial improvement from our membership offerings. Moving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $58 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation. Next, let me touch on our inventory balance. Similar to last year at this time, we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Our quarter-end inventory balance was approximately 4% higher than last year's comparable period. As we noted during last year's third quarter earnings call, approximately $600 million of inventory receipts came in a few days later than we had expected, moving from October into November. Adjusting for that timing shift, this year's ending inventory balance would have been approximately 4% lower than last year's targeted ending balance. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $873 million to shareholders through dividends of $603 million and share repurchases of $270 million. We now expect share repurchases of approximately $350 million for the year. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the year, starting with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. From a top line perspective, we now expect our fourth quarter comparable sales to be down in the range of 3% to 7%. Our Enterprise comparable sales through the first three weeks of November are near the low end of the fourth quarter range. On the profitability side, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be in the range of 4.7% to 5%, which compares to a rate of 4.8% last year. Our fourth quarter gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year by approximately 30 basis points. Although favorable to last year, the year-over-year improvement is less than the 90 basis points of expansion we reported for the third quarter. From a sequential standpoint, there are three main items I would highlight that are expected to reduce the rate expansion in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. First, although it is still a benefit compared to last year, the changes to our membership offering are less impactful in the larger holiday quarter. Second, product margin rates are expected to be closer to flat to last year in the fourth quarter compared to a benefit in the third quarter. And third, we expect supply chain cost to be a slight pressure in the fourth quarter versus a benefit in the third quarter. From an SG&A standpoint, when comparing to last year, we expect our fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales to be more favorable than our year-to-date trends, which is due in part to the impact of the extra week this year. The range of SG&A implied in the fourth quarter incorporates our normal course of actions to adjust variable expenses under the different revenue scenarios as well as adjustments to incentive compensation align with our expected financial outcomes. As a reminder, we expect the extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million in SG&A, we still expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. Let me provide more details on our full year guidance, which incorporates the color I just shared on the fourth quarter. We now expect the following. Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.7 billion, Enterprise comparable sales to decline 6% to 7.5%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 4% to 4.1%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6 to $6.30, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24%, and lastly, our interest income is still expected to exceed interest expense this year. Our full year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions remain very similar to what we shared last quarter. And some of the key callouts are the following. We still expect our gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23. A large driver of the gross profit rate improvement is expected to come from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide approximately 35 basis points of improvement. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 95 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we lapped up very low levels last year. The high end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $140 million compared to fiscal '23. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question, as we get into the fourth quarter, it looks like we'll have negative comps, and it will be the third year in a row. As you step back, I think there's logic to this massive pull forward and there is a larger installed base. There should be a replacement cycle. But I wanted to kind of question that. And if it throws any water on this, if there's something else happening here, maybe there is a lack of newness. You mentioned that you didn't lose much share, but thinking about market share as well, but thinking about the cycles and whether we're not -- whether we could be in just a negative industry cycle for a little bit longer.\nCorie Barry: Thanks for the question, Simeon. I think we have a few things going on to your point. So if you think about the comments that I had in the macro section, you've got a variety of stacked issues happening. One is absolutely you had pull forward throughout the pandemic. Two is you also have this kind of sustained inflation. And again, it's sustained inflation on the basics that we've been talking about food, fuel and lodging. And so that's pulling people. We also talked about the fact that a lot of spend right now is geared towards the more service type of things like concerts, like trips. Everywhere you look, people are taking more and more vacations. And so you have all of this kind of shift of spend that's happening. I think secondarily, as it relates specifically to the holiday time frame, the other interesting thing is people have also been buying CE a little bit more steadily throughout the year. If you think about CE as more of a need-based item, not just that kind of giftable item, and so I think there's also just been a little bit of a shift in where people are spending. But I think broadly, what we're seeing reflected right now is the kind of culmination of not just pull forward, but all of these other factors that we're seeing from the consumer as they make those trade-offs. And we've been using the words uneven for probably six quarters now, and I think that is what you're seeing in the variety of results from consumers and where they're choosing to spend their dollars.\nSimeon Gutman: Maybe the quick follow-up is the Q4, I guess, you're running at the low end. Does it get better because the comparison gets better? Or you're hopeful around how the big holiday sales end up playing out?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. I think the comparison certainly gets better. As you think about last year, we were about 3% lower than FY '20 levels. This year, we're lower against FY '20, but the sequential is better in Q4. I think there's still a lot of optimism for holiday. I think there's a lot of great holiday promotions and events. And I think we're trying to temper any expectation on holiday just with the pragmatic view of where the consumer is at right now. And I think you commented on the share. I think we actually -- we say largely held share because it's really hard to actually get a good meaningful number on share, but we feel good about our share position as we go into the holiday period.\nSimeon Gutman: Okay. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks, and good morning. So, thanks for the commentary around the credit card headwind that you're thinking about next year being offset by the membership. Can you talk about implicitly what you're assuming as a headwind in that comment, there's a lot of speculation. There's a lot of numbers getting thrown around in the market. And so I just want to try to understand what you're implicitly assuming? And then in addition, what are the other big puts and takes in gross margin as you think about 2024, as you think about initiative spending as well as your health efforts?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Thanks for the question. For credit card next year, I mean, obviously, there's a number of scenarios we're trying to understand as you think about next year. So we're not really guiding next year now. But when we think about the credit card, that pressure that we expect to see, we believe, will largely be offset by benefits we might see from the membership program and services category expanding a bit more from a gross property perspective. The factors within the credit card, one of the biggest things we're trying to understand is just where do net credit losses go. They're -- at the moment, they're pretty close to where they were pre-pandemic. They were very low levels during the pandemic. And so we've been seeing them grow a little bit. And so the question would be how high did those grow if they do grow into next year and what sort of pressure. The other factor to consider is that, generally speaking, our receivable balance is higher than it used to be over the last several years. And so a higher receivable balance and interest income obviously can offset some of those pressures as well. So those are a couple of the bigger things we're trying to understand as we think about the credit card specifically. And as you mentioned, again, for next year, the other puts and takes, again, we're not guiding next year, but that credit card pressure and the membership benefit is one of the bigger factors we're trying to understand. Another one that I would call out would be -- we know that we're going to likely have to add STI expense back in as we're -- we've lowered the expense this year as we reset STI in the coming year to roughly $85 million that we would likely add back. Clearly, where the industry is a question as well to the extent that sales are flat or up, it helps relieve some of the pressure of some fixed costs. Clearly, the level of pressure matters quite a bit next year. If it's a small increase, small decline, it's less significant than is a bigger decline. So those are some of the bigger factors we're trying to think through as we go into next year.\nChris Horvers: So that's a perfect segue. On the SG&A side, Corie, I know you talked about your NPS scores with purchasing customers and what you're seeing in the store, you've caught what feels like a lot of labor over the past few years or past couple of years. Are there any metrics that you're seeing, whether it's non-purchasing customers, like close rates versus people walking indoor that are concerning to you? And then as you think about '24, given that you've comped negatively for this sustained period, is there just less flexibility to manage the labor component?\nCorie Barry: So I alluded to NPS being one of the factors that we -- you can imagine, there is a broad array of both operational and then more survey-based metrics that we're looking at, everything from how fast can we do an in-store pick, how good is the curbside experience. We specifically talked about and we can see meaningful improvements year-over-year in product availability, in associate availability, in a variety of products and pricing, and those have continuously improved even as this year has gone on. And actually, we can also see some level of improvement in some of those through non-purchasers as well. So we're watching both sides of this and that sequential improvement is happening across both purchasers and non-purchasers. And yes, we're watching close rate too, and the team is doing a really nice job measuring themselves and showing some progress against their close rate expectations as well. So we are -- literally, we have the almost Rubik's cube of operational and customer survey-based metrics so we can assess. I think what the team has done a really amazing job at is your point around flexibility. You talked about do you have less. Interestingly, now we have associates who can opt into and get certified in not just multiple areas of expertise within the store, but they can also get certified for operations roles and sales roles, and they can actually move between stores within their markets. And so we can flex not just against what's the consumer demand at the highest level, we can actually flex within a market depending on how and where people are choosing to shop. So I can even use an example like in the last week, we've seen a lot more people opting into in-store pickup and curbside and needing a bit more ship from store, and we can quickly then shift some of that labor into those areas, while still trying to strike the balance. We also talked about even moving some of the ship from store out of stores using those automated facilities so that when we do have labor in the stores, it's more customer-facing. It's facing more some of these key areas where we're trying to deliver these experiences. So not perfect and certainly not going to be perfect every single day at every single location, but we really are working hard, and I give the team a great deal of credit for every day monitoring both the experiences and the operational metrics that will tell us whether or not we're delivering.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Have a great Thanksgiving.\nCorie Barry: Thanks, you too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPeter Keith: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. Happy holidays. Nice to see the membership program changes coming a bit more accretive than initially guided. Could you help us unpack that a little bit in terms of the drivers, if it's just removing the free installation or maybe that middle tier is trending a little more profitable than you thought. Maybe curious on what the uptick is from?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. The main drivers of the improvement from a rate perspective are -- there's basically four main areas. The first is the point change to the three My Best Buy program. The second would be just the growth in paid members over time and the recognition of those annual fees. The changes we made to the total tech program, moving it to Total, mainly came through with lowering the cost to fulfill as we removed the free installation that also was part of the 35 basis points, and the resumption of appliance at home theater installation, paid insulation is the other part of the number. The main drivers of it coming better than our expectations are around higher-than-expected paid installation volumes and then also lower-than-expected Best Buy claims and lower Apple premiums than we had expected.\nPeter Keith: Okay. That's helpful, Matt. And then -- and Corie, I guess everyone is very curious on product innovation and understanding we're kind of in this air pocket with very little innovation. But I'm curious are there any little green shoots that you're seeing in stores, maybe smaller products that we're not thinking about that give us some optimism that newness can drive sales?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. I actually -- I mean, I might be biased, but I think there's a lot of green shoots that are out there. And you're right, back to the -- one of the first questions, definitely what has also caused the pullback in CE, and I didn't hit it, to begin with, I'll hit it now, is just a bit of a lack of innovation when everyone was trying so hard to produce as much as possible or pull back as hard as possible, we just haven't seen it. Now we are starting to see a little bit of that turn toward innovation. What we can see, even in TVs, we can see there's a lot more interest in those large screen sizes. We can see growth in the like 77-inch plus kind of categories where people want to get that newness. We actually have double the amount of SKUs in the 97-inch and above TV category, which I know sounds insane, but those are really interesting things to people from a true entertaining at home perspective. In majors, there's a brand-new washer/dryer combo unit from GE, so you can both do the washing and the drying in one unit, which is a really interesting innovation for people like me who might want to do two loads at once, full time and get through it all. In gaming, you can see there's really good availability of consoles, with some really interesting new titles that are driving some demand, some handheld gaming from ASUS and Lenovo. Those are great. And then there's kind of some smaller just interesting things. We talked about the Meta Quest 3, the Meta Ray-Ban sunglasses and not only can you capture pictures but has audio built in. And then I think there's lots of just really small fun giftable things, right? There's everything from the automated bird feeder to the automated litter box and everything in between. So what's cool and the reason a little tongue in cheek, we mentioned the Best Buy sells that is there are actually a ton of really interesting fun consumer technology devices. And to your point, they're kind of small, but they're starting to lead the way into what I think will be more meaningful cycles as we head into the back half of next year. As you think about, we mentioned generative AI and products and importantly, chips that geared toward running those kind of large language processing models. And you can imagine that will extend not just into computing, but into other areas. And we can't always talk about everything that we can see on the horizon, but we definitely can see some interesting products as our vendors, as you all know, are just as incented to stimulate demand as we are.\nPeter Keith: Very good. Good luck with the holiday season.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMike Baker: Okay. Great. Thank you. And this was sort of touched on, but the promotional activity, I think you said it's up. Where is it versus plan? Do you expect it to get more promotional as we get through the holiday season? And you said this year, it will be more traditional, i.e., Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the last few weeks, et cetera. Can you remind us how the holiday played out last year?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I think strategically -- I think we've done a really good job of managing our promotional plan overall. I think the promotions in terms of the discounts and mix of promotions are up versus last year, and in many cases, up compared to where they were pre-pandemic. Again, it hasn't necessarily manifested in our pressure on our product margin rates because we're still receiving a good amount of funding from our vendors to help stimulate the sales that you would expect us to want to do. I think as you look about the holiday season, I think we are expecting the holiday to be a very sales-driven event. Consumers are looking for deals, and they're looking for value. And because of that, we believe it will look probably more closely to like it was pre-pandemic, where people are gravitating towards the big sale events around Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday and a couple of weeks before Christmas. So a pretty similar cadence to what we saw in FY '20, although in FY '20, we did -- didn't have as much pull forward into October as we likely still have in this current year. So a more similar cadence to promotional events. I would expect holiday always to be promotional, and we are well positioned to be promotional and still maintain a great profitable story for our investors. So overall, I think we're in a great spot.\nCorie Barry: And just to be explicit, what we actually had said, the promo environment was as expected. It was in line with our expectations in Q3. And you can imagine we're kind of taking -- what we're seeing and pushing that into Q4, but it hasn't been wildly outside our expectations.\nMike Baker: Got it. Okay. Thank you. If I could ask one more, and maybe you can't answer this, but you did talk a lot about some crowding out in that kind of dynamic with the higher inflation. Well, now all of a sudden, the inflation concern is turning to deflation concern. Asking you to look into your crystal ball, how that could impact your sales results next year if the inflation goes away and we're more in a deflationary environment?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. I mean we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about the effects of inflation. We've been pretty consistent in saying, where it's putting pressure on the consumer is because it's in those key basic areas of need, fuel, food, lodging, consumables like the stuff you just kind of need every single day. And that's what's been eating into a lot of that pent-up savings, especially for some of the lower income demographics. And so if you start to get into a world where you see more disinflation in some of those areas, then as you would expect, you start to free up some of that share of wallet for potentially getting back into goods or some of the kind of higher ticket purchases. And so we're watching that carefully. Right now, still very elevated versus especially pre-pandemic, slowing down, and to your point, people start to talk about it, which over time, I think, could present some opportunity for people to move back into the goods space, also, of course, depending on how elevated that spend remains around services and things like vacations and spending outside the home.\nMike Baker: Yeah. Makes perfect sense. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nCorie Barry: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone of Citi. Your line is open.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on average selling prices. So it sounds like it was flat, slight improvement. What drove that improvement on a sequential basis by category? And then as you think about the fourth quarter, can you talk about your outlook for units versus ASPs?\nMatt Bilunas: Yeah. I -- we'll get into the by category improvement to ASPs. Generally speaking, we are starting to, I would say, lap some of the ASP reduction. We've been seeing ASPs slowly get lower, also the last number of quarters. I think we're starting to lap some of that deflation in that average selling price, if you will. So I think it's probably as much as that as people are gravitating to in some cases, we mentioned that TV is an area of trade down that we are actually seeing. And so those do tend to lower your ASPs because it's a big ticket item. And as we start to lap that, I think you're starting to see some relief on the ASP sequentially. Again, I think in certain areas, so in terms of like Q4, clearly, we've been seeing unit pressure overall, but there are some areas where some of our bigger categories we are expecting the units to improve. We're expecting TV units to increase. We're expecting to see improvements in notebook units as well. So it's a little bit varied, but those are some of the bigger ones.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then Corie, I had a question. Just thinking about next year, I think you alluded to more stabilization and the potential for growth in the back half. I guess I was curious, how do you see the recovery playing out? We're waiting for the tech refresh cycle. But if the overall promotional environment stays challenging, how do you think about the recovery from market share position or maybe if the consumer is willing to trade down, how are you positioned to outpace the industry overall?\nCorie Barry: So if I think about how the last year has played out, this industry has largely been in a very promotional stance for over the last year. We've been pretty consistent in saying promos are back to, if not greater, than FY '20 levels. So this is not a new phenomenon for us. So even as we head into next year, we're lapping that. And even in that environment where you've seen that level of promotionality, as Matt said, we've sustained our share position. So I think the team has done a beautiful job positioning us well in a very promotional environment. And I wouldn't be surprised to see that environment continue into the first part of next year. And again, we're lapping that kind of similar environment last year. So it's not a huge change in trajectory for us. I think what starts to make the back half, in our view, potentially more interesting next year is really a function of the innovation cycles. And we can start to see a line of sight toward even read a little bit about, especially on some of the computing and processing side, devices that might start to feed into that as we head into the back half of next year. And back to Peter's earlier question, we can start to see on the horizon, some of that newness and innovation really on the docket as you head into the back half and into holiday for next year as everyone again, it's pretty incented to want to bring some vitality back to the industry.\nSteven Zaccone: Thanks very much for the detail. Have a nice Thanksgiving.\nCorie Barry: Yeah. Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. Thanks for taking my question. First one is on the competitive landscape. So you held market share in 3Q, and that's consistent with your comments in the first half. Obviously, you guys have superior customer service and assortment. So what's driving the success among competitors in the industry, who you're tracking who are taking share? Is it purely a function of price? And how is that informing your pricing strategy over the next couple of quarters?\nCorie Barry: Again, I'm probably biased, but I don't think it's purely a function of price. I think we've been very clear, we have to be price competitive, and that is one of the base tentpoles of our strategy. And that said, we also, I think, have a team that has a proven track record of very adept promotional planning around key drive times, whether that's some of the secondary holidays or whether it's the main holiday that we're headed into. So I kind of think of price as the like primary tentpole. But in order to differentiate, I think what we're doubling down on is what we do, that is different than anyone else just given who we are. We are agnostic to the customer. So we don't care what the operating system is or who makes the hardware. We're there for the customer to help them to build on that. We have what we like to call human-enabled services. So we can help you in the store. We can consult for you in your home. We can repair. We can take back. We can trade in. You can buy open box. You can go to an outlet. Like, we just have the huge end-to-end variety of solutions all the way from inspire to support, so that's the kind of second differentiator for us. And then third, I think we're building on those things with a unique membership program with unique offers that reach out to our members with a membership program that's based on the things that we uniquely do well. And then fourth, I have to give major credit to our vendor partners as well, even though we're in a little bit of a slower innovation cycle, they remain closely committed to our success, which means we do have everything from the most new beautiful 98-inch TV that's out on the floor, all the way to those opening price point Chromebooks or opening price point televisions that might be right for you at a value play. And I think our ability to showcase those high and new experience as well as all the way through the rest of the assortment really is that last differentiating piece for us.\nJonathan Matuszewski: That's great color. Thanks so much. And then a quick follow-up on Best Buy Health. You've had some exciting announcements on that side of the business in terms of partnerships in the industry. At the Investor Day, I think you called out expectations for that to grow at a CAGR of an impressive 40% over the next couple of years. Is that business at scale to switch from kind of dilution to accretion in terms of the overall enterprise next year? Any thoughts there would be helpful.\nCorie Barry: Yeah. So we remain really excited about the Health business, and we were pretty clear that we had pulled the FY '25 targets on the whole or as the macro backdrop has changed. And so we are, of course, working behind the scenes to really fortify that business for the future. And I know someone had asked earlier as we think about the puts and takes for next year, we would continue to expect Health to become more accretive, and we laid that out as kind of our structural thesis at our Investor Day. And that part of the thesis remains true for us. And while it still is relatively small at this point, we are seeing some nice uptick, particularly in that kind of care-at-home side of things, where we've announced partnerships with Geisinger and with Atrium Health as we think about how we can use our unique Geek Squad assets as well as the unique product assortment that we have to help deliver care at home. So again, relatively small, but the team is doing a nice job continuing to ensure that, that part of the business is accretive and grows over time.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes of Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Corie, Matt.\nCorie Barry: Good morning.\nSteven Forbes: Matt, you briefly mentioned 15 to 20 basis points of vendor funding being recorded in expenses. Curious if you can maybe give us a little more color there? And then any sort of different way of thinking about how vendor funding maybe supports the margin outlook for 2024? Or are you changing the 2024 margin color of being able to hold margin in a flat sales environment, any update there?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Yeah. So first of all, it was $15 million to $20 million of impact on net basis points, just to make sure I'm clear. And that would carry on as you get into next quarter Q4 and the first part of next year. And this is strictly a geography. There is no change to the overall financial statements, if you will, just moving as a cost -- offsetting a cost of sales to offsetting SG&A. Essentially, we get any number of types of vendor funding for a number of different things. And when we can actually be more specific with the funding, matching and offsetting the specific cost, we then record that as an offset to SG&A versus offsetting cost of sales. So that's specifically what's happened. And it's just -- it's part of the funding that we get not all of it, obviously. And so we would expect that to continue. To your second question, as you look at next year, at this point, we're not guiding next year, but we would expect product margins to be somewhat of a neutral impact to next year. Overall, we don't, at this point, see a lot of material changes either way. We have a very strong relationship with our vendors, and they are obviously as interested in us in stimulating sales and showcasing their products and innovations that they have. So at this point, we don't see any change to that as we look into next year.\nCorie Barry: Matt hit on this, but I want to underscore, the way in which our vendors participate with us varies as you would expect, depending on what we're seeing in the macro. Sometimes that shows up as more promotional partnership. But a lot of times, that shows up in very different ways it can be in how we think about specialized labor, it can be in store experiences like we mentioned on the call, it can be in our Best Buy ads business or in supply chain fulfillment or in services. And I think what's important is our overall level of invested support has grown in the aggregate even as we compare it to pre-pandemic levels. And I think that is the part that for us as important is how can we be the very best partner to our vendors as we collectively want to bring, especially some of this newer innovation to market.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you, Corie and Matt. Maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Corie. Any updated thoughts on maybe some of your newer growth initiatives such as device life cycle management, really just trying to think through whether the current sort of operating performance or challenges that are out there are impacting the investments you plan to put behind some of these initiatives? Or whether that's still sort of a growth sort of plan for next year?\nCorie Barry: Yeah. As it relates -- you hit on specifically device life cycle management, I'm maybe going to take it up one level and that is, we've talked about Geek Squad as a service, because it can be everything from device cycle management, which is newer side of this, but also just providing service on behalf of vendors as you think about being an Apple authorized service provider or some of our Best Buy business offerings where we actually use our service profile to go out and do installations writ large. What's nice about an initiative like this is it doesn't require, especially in the earlier stages, much incremental investment. We already have Geek Squad City, which is a very large facility, well staffed with trained experts who we can leverage some of their capacities in order to deliver on something like device life cycle management. Now then we can make decisions as something like that ramps. We didn't mention it this quarter because in Q4, honestly, it's not the biggest front and center area of focus. But you can also imagine behind the scenes, if there are other ways for us to leverage our existing expertise and capacity. Those are very interesting strategic initiatives for us. And we remain excited about this one. We remain excited about the pipeline that we're seeing in this one. And obviously, I think you can expect that we will update you with more clarity as it develops. So with that, I think that -- thank you. I think that is our last question, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. Thank you for the nice wishes. I hope you all also have a wonderful holiday, and we look forward to updating you all on our results and progress during our next call in February. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.8 billion declined 6.9% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% declined 10 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $57 million lower than last year, and it increased approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 90 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 6.5% to $1.29. When viewing our performance compared to our expectations, we did not see the sequential improvement versus the second quarter that our third quarter outlook assumed. From an enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, August decline of approximately 6% was our best performing month, with September down 7% and October down 8%. Although our sales were below plan, our non-GAAP operating income rate exceeded our outlook by approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower SG&A. The lower-than-expected SG&A was largely driven by tighter expense management in areas such as store payroll and advertising expense as we adjusted plans to account for sales trends. Our gross profit rate was essentially flat to our expectations. Lastly, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A while our outlook assumed it would have been a reduction of cost of sales. We anticipate similar recognition of this funding in Q4 in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.2% to $9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 7.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, computing, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was essentially flat to last year, which is a slight improvement relative to the past few quarters. In our International segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and a negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 22.9%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by the following. First, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Second, our product margin rates improved versus last year, including a higher level of vendor-supported promotions and the benefit from optimization efforts across multiple areas. And third, lower supply chain costs. Before moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which performed better than we expected in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the profit share has been approximately flat from a dollar perspective over the course of the year, which has resulted in a slightly positive impact to our gross profit rate. In the fourth quarter, we expect the profit share to come in better than we had expected and once again be very similar to last year from a dollar perspective. As we look to next year, we expect the credit card profit share to be a pressure to our gross profit rate. At this point in time, we expect this pressure to be offset by continued financial improvement from our membership offerings. Moving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $58 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation. Next, let me touch on our inventory balance. Similar to last year at this time, we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Our quarter-end inventory balance was approximately 4% higher than last year's comparable period. As we noted during last year's third quarter earnings call, approximately $600 million of inventory receipts came in a few days later than we had expected, moving from October into November. Adjusting for that timing shift, this year's ending inventory balance would have been approximately 4% lower than last year's targeted ending balance. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $873 million to shareholders through dividends of $603 million and share repurchases of $270 million. We now expect share repurchases of approximately $350 million for the year. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the year, starting with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. From a top line perspective, we now expect our fourth quarter comparable sales to be down in the range of 3% to 7%. Our Enterprise comparable sales through the first three weeks of November are near the low end of the fourth quarter range. On the profitability side, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be in the range of 4.7% to 5%, which compares to a rate of 4.8% last year. Our fourth quarter gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year by approximately 30 basis points. Although favorable to last year, the year-over-year improvement is less than the 90 basis points of expansion we reported for the third quarter. From a sequential standpoint, there are three main items I would highlight that are expected to reduce the rate expansion in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. First, although it is still a benefit compared to last year, the changes to our membership offering are less impactful in the larger holiday quarter. Second, product margin rates are expected to be closer to flat to last year in the fourth quarter compared to a benefit in the third quarter. And third, we expect supply chain cost to be a slight pressure in the fourth quarter versus a benefit in the third quarter. From an SG&A standpoint, when comparing to last year, we expect our fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales to be more favorable than our year-to-date trends, which is due in part to the impact of the extra week this year. The range of SG&A implied in the fourth quarter incorporates our normal course of actions to adjust variable expenses under the different revenue scenarios as well as adjustments to incentive compensation align with our expected financial outcomes. As a reminder, we expect the extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million in SG&A, we still expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. Let me provide more details on our full year guidance, which incorporates the color I just shared on the fourth quarter. We now expect the following. Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.7 billion, Enterprise comparable sales to decline 6% to 7.5%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 4% to 4.1%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6 to $6.30, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24%, and lastly, our interest income is still expected to exceed interest expense this year. Our full year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions remain very similar to what we shared last quarter. And some of the key callouts are the following. We still expect our gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23. A large driver of the gross profit rate improvement is expected to come from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide approximately 35 basis points of improvement. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 95 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we lapped up very low levels last year. The high end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $140 million compared to fiscal '23. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Yeah. I think the comparison certainly gets better. As you think about last year, we were about 3% lower than FY '20 levels. This year, we're lower against FY '20, but the sequential is better in Q4. I think there's still a lot of optimism for holiday. I think there's a lot of great holiday promotions and events. And I think we're trying to temper any expectation on holiday just with the pragmatic view of where the consumer is at right now. And I think you commented on the share. I think we actually -- we say largely held share because it's really hard to actually get a good meaningful number on share, but we feel good about our share position as we go into the holiday period. Sure. Thanks for the question. For credit card next year, I mean, obviously, there's a number of scenarios we're trying to understand as you think about next year. So we're not really guiding next year now. But when we think about the credit card, that pressure that we expect to see, we believe, will largely be offset by benefits we might see from the membership program and services category expanding a bit more from a gross property perspective. The factors within the credit card, one of the biggest things we're trying to understand is just where do net credit losses go. They're -- at the moment, they're pretty close to where they were pre-pandemic. They were very low levels during the pandemic. And so we've been seeing them grow a little bit. And so the question would be how high did those grow if they do grow into next year and what sort of pressure. The other factor to consider is that, generally speaking, our receivable balance is higher than it used to be over the last several years. And so a higher receivable balance and interest income obviously can offset some of those pressures as well. So those are a couple of the bigger things we're trying to understand as we think about the credit card specifically. And as you mentioned, again, for next year, the other puts and takes, again, we're not guiding next year, but that credit card pressure and the membership benefit is one of the bigger factors we're trying to understand. Another one that I would call out would be -- we know that we're going to likely have to add STI expense back in as we're -- we've lowered the expense this year as we reset STI in the coming year to roughly $85 million that we would likely add back. Clearly, where the industry is a question as well to the extent that sales are flat or up, it helps relieve some of the pressure of some fixed costs. Clearly, the level of pressure matters quite a bit next year. If it's a small increase, small decline, it's less significant than is a bigger decline. So those are some of the bigger factors we're trying to think through as we go into next year. Sure. The main drivers of the improvement from a rate perspective are -- there's basically four main areas. The first is the point change to the three My Best Buy program. The second would be just the growth in paid members over time and the recognition of those annual fees. The changes we made to the total tech program, moving it to Total, mainly came through with lowering the cost to fulfill as we removed the free installation that also was part of the 35 basis points, and the resumption of appliance at home theater installation, paid insulation is the other part of the number. The main drivers of it coming better than our expectations are around higher-than-expected paid installation volumes and then also lower-than-expected Best Buy claims and lower Apple premiums than we had expected. Sure. I think strategically -- I think we've done a really good job of managing our promotional plan overall. I think the promotions in terms of the discounts and mix of promotions are up versus last year, and in many cases, up compared to where they were pre-pandemic. Again, it hasn't necessarily manifested in our pressure on our product margin rates because we're still receiving a good amount of funding from our vendors to help stimulate the sales that you would expect us to want to do. I think as you look about the holiday season, I think we are expecting the holiday to be a very sales-driven event. Consumers are looking for deals, and they're looking for value. And because of that, we believe it will look probably more closely to like it was pre-pandemic, where people are gravitating towards the big sale events around Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday and a couple of weeks before Christmas. So a pretty similar cadence to what we saw in FY '20, although in FY '20, we did -- didn't have as much pull forward into October as we likely still have in this current year. So a more similar cadence to promotional events. I would expect holiday always to be promotional, and we are well positioned to be promotional and still maintain a great profitable story for our investors. So overall, I think we're in a great spot. Yeah. I -- we'll get into the by category improvement to ASPs. Generally speaking, we are starting to, I would say, lap some of the ASP reduction. We've been seeing ASPs slowly get lower, also the last number of quarters. I think we're starting to lap some of that deflation in that average selling price, if you will. So I think it's probably as much as that as people are gravitating to in some cases, we mentioned that TV is an area of trade down that we are actually seeing. And so those do tend to lower your ASPs because it's a big ticket item. And as we start to lap that, I think you're starting to see some relief on the ASP sequentially. Again, I think in certain areas, so in terms of like Q4, clearly, we've been seeing unit pressure overall, but there are some areas where some of our bigger categories we are expecting the units to improve. We're expecting TV units to increase. We're expecting to see improvements in notebook units as well. So it's a little bit varied, but those are some of the bigger ones. Sure. Yeah. So first of all, it was $15 million to $20 million of impact on net basis points, just to make sure I'm clear. And that would carry on as you get into next quarter Q4 and the first part of next year. And this is strictly a geography. There is no change to the overall financial statements, if you will, just moving as a cost -- offsetting a cost of sales to offsetting SG&A. Essentially, we get any number of types of vendor funding for a number of different things. And when we can actually be more specific with the funding, matching and offsetting the specific cost, we then record that as an offset to SG&A versus offsetting cost of sales. So that's specifically what's happened. And it's just -- it's part of the funding that we get not all of it, obviously. And so we would expect that to continue. To your second question, as you look at next year, at this point, we're not guiding next year, but we would expect product margins to be somewhat of a neutral impact to next year. Overall, we don't, at this point, see a lot of material changes either way. We have a very strong relationship with our vendors, and they are obviously as interested in us in stimulating sales and showcasing their products and innovations that they have. So at this point, we don't see any change to that as we look into next year."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the third quarter, we are reporting better-than-expected profitability on slightly softer-than-expected revenue. Specifically, we are reporting a comparable sales decline of 6.9%, which is slightly below our outlook for the quarter as consumer demand softened through the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our Q3 gross profit rate 90 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program and better product margins. We also lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations. During the quarter, we grew our paid membership base and drove meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction scores across many of our service offerings, including in-home delivery, in-store services and remote support. Our Q3 results demonstrate our ongoing strong operational execution as we navigate through the sales pressure our industry has been experiencing for the past several quarters. The sales pressure is due to many factors, including the pandemic pull-forward of tech purchases, the shift back into services outside the home like travel and entertainment and inflation. In the more recent macro-environment, consumer demand has been even more uneven and difficult to predict. Based on the sales trends in Q3 and so far in November, we believe it is prudent to lower our revenue outlook for Q4. But despite the lowered sales outlook, the midpoint of our annual EPS guidance is now slightly higher than the midpoint of our original guidance as we entered the year. I want to thank our associates for their resilience and relentless focus on our customers. I continue to be so very proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future. Now, I would like to provide more color on our Q3 performance and holiday plans before passing the call off to Matt for the financial details on the quarter and our outlook. We continue to strategically manage our promotional plan and we're price-competitive in an environment, where consumers are very deal-focused and making spend tradeoffs right for their budget. Consumers are looking for value, and from an industry themes' perspective, we are seeing some trade-down in the television category, but not as much trade-down in other categories. As a result, and as expected, the goal of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Similar to the first half of the year, during Q3, our purchasing customers were relatively consistent in terms of demographics versus last year. As a reminder, we over-index with higher-income consumers, compared to the general population. And we saw the percent of revenue categorized as premium and the percent of purchases over $1,000 remain constant versus last year. We have largely maintained our year-to-date industry share in our Circana, formerly NPD-tracked categories. Against this backdrop, our focus on deepening relationships with customers remains crucial. Our membership program delivered another quarter of growth and improved profitability versus last year. The Q3 contribution to the enterprise operating income rate was larger-than-expected due to the combination of a lower cost to serve and higher paid in-home installation services. For the full year of fiscal '24, we now expect our three-tiered membership program to contribute approximately 35 basis points of Enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion. It is still early since we introduced material changes in June, but there are a number of insights I would like to share. One, we continue to increase our paid membership base and now have 6.6 million members. This compares to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During the third quarter, we signed up approximately 35% more new paid members compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by the addition of the new Tier and buoyed by back-to-school and October's member month events. Two, our paid members continue to interact with the brand and shop more frequently compared to non-members, which is the goal of any membership program. Three, and though it is early and we have not yet lapped the new programs, retention rates are outperforming expectations. Four, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total tech offer, continues to resonate more strongly in our physical store setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchase them. It also includes up to two years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases and includes all the benefits of My Best Buy Plus. And five, our My Best Buy Plus tier is resonating more with the digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments. This is the new tier for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60-day return and exchange window on most products. We are still early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers as well as continuously improving the digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Of course, we also have a free membership tier that enables free shipping for everyone, a great differentiator, especially in the holiday season. During the quarter, we continued to evolve our omnichannel capabilities to support our strategy and make it easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert consultation and service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Last month, we introduced Best Buy Drops, which is a new experience only available through the Best Buy app. It gives customers the opportunity to access product releases, limited edition items, launches and deals from a variety of categories. There are multiple drops nearly every week, and they're only available in limited quantities. We are encouraged by the early results as Best Buy Drops is driving both incremental customer app downloads and higher frequency of app visits. We have also seen growth in sales from customers who are getting help from our virtual sales associates. These interactions, which can be via phone, chat or our virtual store, drive much higher conversion rates and average order values than our general dot.com levels. This quarter, we had 140,000 customer interactions by a video chat with associates, specifically out of our virtual store locations. As a reminder, this is a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that are staffed with dedicated associates and no physical customers. We also teamed up with live shopping platform Talk Shop Live, to test a series of online shopping events this month, starring our virtual sales associates. These events feature products from some of our newer categories like beauty and wellness as well as new tech and unique products. Our physical store portfolio is one of our key assets, and the role of our stores is to provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need some stores to be more cost and capital efficient to operate. As a reminder, while almost one-third of our domestic sales are online, 43% of those sales were picked up in one of our stores by customers in Q3. And most customers shop us in multiple channels. Consistent with our normal cadence, we have largely completed the changes to our store portfolio for the year, so we can focus on the holiday season with minimal disruption to our physical stores. As we think about next year with the current economic backdrop, we plan to spend more of our capital expenditures refreshing a greater number of our stores and less on large-scale remodels. As such, we have three priorities for our US store fleet in the near term. Number one, we are refreshing our stores with a particular focus on improving enlivening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, this year, in all our stores, we installed new premium end caps in partnership with key vendors that improve the merchandising in the center of the store. This year, we installed up to 10 of these new end caps per store or roughly one-third of our end caps per store and plan to add more next year as we work to upgrade these crucial locations in our stores. In addition, this year, we rightsized our traditional gaming spaces in roughly half of our stores to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as Greenworks cordless power tools, wellness products like the Oura ring, Epson short throw projectors, e-bikes and scooters and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market share growth. And as always, we continue to work closely with our vendor partners to add experiences to our stores. For example, LEGO and Therabody invested in new shop-in-shops in all our 35,000 square foot experience stores. In addition, and as you would expect, many of our premium partners are continuously updating their in-store spaces to reflect their latest innovations. We will continue this work next year in all our stores, rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we are leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. Our second priority is to keep investing in formats we know drive returns. This year, we implemented 8 large format 35,000 square foot experienced store remodels for a total of 54 and will end the year with 23 outlet stores. At this point in time, we plan to implement a minimal number of remodels and outlets next year. And the third priority is to open a few smaller footprint stores to keep testing our hypothesis at physical points of presence matter, and we need less selling square footage and more fulfillment and inventory holding space. In addition, we plan to open a few smaller stores in outstate markets to test the impact of adding new locations and geographies where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low. At the same time, we also continue to close existing traditional stores as a result of our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. This year, we have closed 24 stores. Over the past five years, we have closed approximately 100 Best Buy stores, which is a 10% decline in store count during that time frame. And we expect to close roughly 15 to 20 stores per year in the near term. We have been enhancing our supply chain network to support these footprint changes and deliver speed, predictability and choice to our customers. For example, we have worked to optimize our ship-from-store hub footprint to maintain substantial coverage for faster offers and take shipping volume pressure off the majority of the stores to allow them to focus on in-store and pickup experiences. Additionally, we are optimizing our shipping locations to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness while still delivering with speed. And as a result, in Q3, we had the lowest ship from store volume as a percent of total since well before the pandemic, with approximately 62% of e-commerce small packages delivered to customers from automated distribution centers. We also continued to augment our own supply chain through other partners and launched Best Buy on DoorDash marketplace, offering our second scheduled parcel delivery option in addition to Instacart Marketplace. As we have discussed previously, we have made strategic structural changes to our store operating model over the past few years to adjust to the shifts we have seen in customer shopping behavior and our corresponding operational needs. These changes provide more flexibility and have allowed us to flex labor hours with the fluctuations in customer sales, shopping preferences like curbside and traffic. As a result, we kept our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. As you can imagine, there is a delicate balance to maintain while we adjust our store operating model as the expert service our associates provide customers is a core competitive advantage. We keep a very close watch on our customer satisfaction trends to make sure we are not negatively impacting the customer experience. Broadly, I am proud that the team is doing this work while driving higher purchasing customer NPS for associate availability, product availability and pricing. We are also committed, of course, to providing a great employee experience through training opportunities and benefits. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now led thousands of our sales associates through a certification process focused on our foundational retail excellence. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost-effective ways. A great example is our app built for employees called Solution Sidekick, that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and locations. Our employees have embraced solution Sidekick and we can see higher customer NPS when our employees are utilizing the app in their interactions with customers. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. Our average tenure, excluding our seasonal workforce, for field employees is just under five years, and our general manager tenure is almost 16 years. This is crucial as we can directly tie tenured experience and training certifications to NPS improvement over time. We have also seen a strong pool of applicants for new associates to supplement our store teams this holiday season. As you all have likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun. Since we are preparing for a customer who is very deal focused, we expect shopping patterns will look even more similar to historical holiday periods than they did last year with customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last two weeks of December. From an inventory perspective, we expect to have strong product availability across categories this year. We will continue to manage inventory strategically to maximize our ability to flex with customer demand. We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all customers and budgets, including special promotions and early access to deals for our My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members. We have curated gift list to help everyone find the perfect gift. We also introduced a new resource on bestbuy.com and the Best Buy app called Yes Best Buy Sells That, where customers can find the latest in tech and gifting, like pet tech, baby tech or electric vehicle chargers, all the way to unique products, some shoppers may not know we sell like skin treatments, toys for all ages and electric outdoor power equipment. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we've extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. And this year, for the first time, we also extended that our shoppers can connect directly with one of our virtual sales experts to get help with their holiday shopping. We're also offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items in addition to convenience store and curbside pickup options. Most orders placed on bestbuy.com or through the Best Buy app are ready for store pickup within one hour. Same-day delivery is also available on most products for a small fee. From a merchandising perspective, we're excited for shoppers to see new innovation in a variety of categories, including AI-powered devices like Microsoft CoPilot and Windows 11 computers, the latest in virtual and mixed reality with Meta Quest 3 or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, immersive audio with Bose Quiet Comfort ultra-headphones and more, and we can help our holiday shoppers take advantage of this new innovation through our trade-in program, which gives the customer value for their old technology. In addition to great deals for our flagship categories like computing, home theater and gaming, that feature our unique ability to showcase higher-end technologies at great value, we also have an expanded assortment of new and growing categories, including e-transportation, health and wellness and outdoor living. Our e-transportation assortment has more options for people of all ages and skill levels. We have twice as many outdoor cooking brands compared to last year and more than 5,000 health and wellness products, including a lineup of fitness, recovery, beauty, skin care, baby tech and more. As you can likely hear, we are very excited to provide customers an amazing experience this holiday season. Of course, the macro environment remains uncertain with some tailwinds and increasingly more headwinds, all contributing uneven impacts on consumers. The job market remains strong and upper income and older demographics, in particular, continue to benefit from excess savings. Overarchingly, the consumer is still spending. But as we have said before, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their households. Given the sustained inflationary pressure on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging and the ongoing preference towards services spending, like restaurants, concert tickets indications. Additional indicators have continued to soften, including declining consumer confidence increasing debt and waning savings, and we saw sales trends soften as we move through the quarter. This environment continues to make it challenging to predict shopping behavior even during the most exciting time of the year. While we are lowering our Q4 sales outlook, we have a wide range to allow for a number of scenarios and the mid- to high end of the range reflects sequential improvement. As we discussed on our last call, there are several factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales can improve. We expect home theater year-over-year performance to improve as we expect to be better positioned with inventory across all price points and budgets than last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our TV units as they grew in Q2 and Q3 and are expected to grow in Q4. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build on our position of strength in the premium assortment. Notebook units were flat compared to last year in Q2, down as expected in Q3 and expected to be up slightly in Q4 and we expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there are strong new software titles. In summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continues to drive volatility, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve. And we remain incredibly confident about our future opportunities. After two years of declines, we believe the consumer electronics industry should see more stabilization next year and possibly growth in the back half of the year. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years, benefiting from a materially larger installed base and the ongoing desire and need to replace technology as it ages. Much of this replacement is spurred by innovation, and in addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access and, of course, generative AI, where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant today than ever. We're the largest CE specialty retailer. We continue to hold one-third of the market share in both the US computing and television industries and we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter results our fiscal '24 outlook. Thanks for the question, Simeon. I think we have a few things going on to your point. So if you think about the comments that I had in the macro section, you've got a variety of stacked issues happening. One is absolutely you had pull forward throughout the pandemic. Two is you also have this kind of sustained inflation. And again, it's sustained inflation on the basics that we've been talking about food, fuel and lodging. And so that's pulling people. We also talked about the fact that a lot of spend right now is geared towards the more service type of things like concerts, like trips. Everywhere you look, people are taking more and more vacations. And so you have all of this kind of shift of spend that's happening. I think secondarily, as it relates specifically to the holiday time frame, the other interesting thing is people have also been buying CE a little bit more steadily throughout the year. If you think about CE as more of a need-based item, not just that kind of giftable item, and so I think there's also just been a little bit of a shift in where people are spending. But I think broadly, what we're seeing reflected right now is the kind of culmination of not just pull forward, but all of these other factors that we're seeing from the consumer as they make those trade-offs. And we've been using the words uneven for probably six quarters now, and I think that is what you're seeing in the variety of results from consumers and where they're choosing to spend their dollars. So I alluded to NPS being one of the factors that we -- you can imagine, there is a broad array of both operational and then more survey-based metrics that we're looking at, everything from how fast can we do an in-store pick, how good is the curbside experience. We specifically talked about and we can see meaningful improvements year-over-year in product availability, in associate availability, in a variety of products and pricing, and those have continuously improved even as this year has gone on. And actually, we can also see some level of improvement in some of those through non-purchasers as well. So we're watching both sides of this and that sequential improvement is happening across both purchasers and non-purchasers. And yes, we're watching close rate too, and the team is doing a really nice job measuring themselves and showing some progress against their close rate expectations as well. So we are -- literally, we have the almost Rubik's cube of operational and customer survey-based metrics so we can assess. I think what the team has done a really amazing job at is your point around flexibility. You talked about do you have less. Interestingly, now we have associates who can opt into and get certified in not just multiple areas of expertise within the store, but they can also get certified for operations roles and sales roles, and they can actually move between stores within their markets. And so we can flex not just against what's the consumer demand at the highest level, we can actually flex within a market depending on how and where people are choosing to shop. So I can even use an example like in the last week, we've seen a lot more people opting into in-store pickup and curbside and needing a bit more ship from store, and we can quickly then shift some of that labor into those areas, while still trying to strike the balance. We also talked about even moving some of the ship from store out of stores using those automated facilities so that when we do have labor in the stores, it's more customer-facing. It's facing more some of these key areas where we're trying to deliver these experiences. So not perfect and certainly not going to be perfect every single day at every single location, but we really are working hard, and I give the team a great deal of credit for every day monitoring both the experiences and the operational metrics that will tell us whether or not we're delivering. Thanks, you too. Yeah. I actually -- I mean, I might be biased, but I think there's a lot of green shoots that are out there. And you're right, back to the -- one of the first questions, definitely what has also caused the pullback in CE, and I didn't hit it, to begin with, I'll hit it now, is just a bit of a lack of innovation when everyone was trying so hard to produce as much as possible or pull back as hard as possible, we just haven't seen it. Now we are starting to see a little bit of that turn toward innovation. What we can see, even in TVs, we can see there's a lot more interest in those large screen sizes. We can see growth in the like 77-inch plus kind of categories where people want to get that newness. We actually have double the amount of SKUs in the 97-inch and above TV category, which I know sounds insane, but those are really interesting things to people from a true entertaining at home perspective. In majors, there's a brand-new washer/dryer combo unit from GE, so you can both do the washing and the drying in one unit, which is a really interesting innovation for people like me who might want to do two loads at once, full time and get through it all. In gaming, you can see there's really good availability of consoles, with some really interesting new titles that are driving some demand, some handheld gaming from ASUS and Lenovo. Those are great. And then there's kind of some smaller just interesting things. We talked about the Meta Quest 3, the Meta Ray-Ban sunglasses and not only can you capture pictures but has audio built in. And then I think there's lots of just really small fun giftable things, right? There's everything from the automated bird feeder to the automated litter box and everything in between. So what's cool and the reason a little tongue in cheek, we mentioned the Best Buy sells that is there are actually a ton of really interesting fun consumer technology devices. And to your point, they're kind of small, but they're starting to lead the way into what I think will be more meaningful cycles as we head into the back half of next year. As you think about, we mentioned generative AI and products and importantly, chips that geared toward running those kind of large language processing models. And you can imagine that will extend not just into computing, but into other areas. And we can't always talk about everything that we can see on the horizon, but we definitely can see some interesting products as our vendors, as you all know, are just as incented to stimulate demand as we are. Thank you. And just to be explicit, what we actually had said, the promo environment was as expected. It was in line with our expectations in Q3. And you can imagine we're kind of taking -- what we're seeing and pushing that into Q4, but it hasn't been wildly outside our expectations. Yeah. I mean we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about the effects of inflation. We've been pretty consistent in saying, where it's putting pressure on the consumer is because it's in those key basic areas of need, fuel, food, lodging, consumables like the stuff you just kind of need every single day. And that's what's been eating into a lot of that pent-up savings, especially for some of the lower income demographics. And so if you start to get into a world where you see more disinflation in some of those areas, then as you would expect, you start to free up some of that share of wallet for potentially getting back into goods or some of the kind of higher ticket purchases. And so we're watching that carefully. Right now, still very elevated versus especially pre-pandemic, slowing down, and to your point, people start to talk about it, which over time, I think, could present some opportunity for people to move back into the goods space, also, of course, depending on how elevated that spend remains around services and things like vacations and spending outside the home. Thanks. So if I think about how the last year has played out, this industry has largely been in a very promotional stance for over the last year. We've been pretty consistent in saying promos are back to, if not greater, than FY '20 levels. So this is not a new phenomenon for us. So even as we head into next year, we're lapping that. And even in that environment where you've seen that level of promotionality, as Matt said, we've sustained our share position. So I think the team has done a beautiful job positioning us well in a very promotional environment. And I wouldn't be surprised to see that environment continue into the first part of next year. And again, we're lapping that kind of similar environment last year. So it's not a huge change in trajectory for us. I think what starts to make the back half, in our view, potentially more interesting next year is really a function of the innovation cycles. And we can start to see a line of sight toward even read a little bit about, especially on some of the computing and processing side, devices that might start to feed into that as we head into the back half of next year. And back to Peter's earlier question, we can start to see on the horizon, some of that newness and innovation really on the docket as you head into the back half and into holiday for next year as everyone again, it's pretty incented to want to bring some vitality back to the industry. Yeah. Thanks. You too. Again, I'm probably biased, but I don't think it's purely a function of price. I think we've been very clear, we have to be price competitive, and that is one of the base tentpoles of our strategy. And that said, we also, I think, have a team that has a proven track record of very adept promotional planning around key drive times, whether that's some of the secondary holidays or whether it's the main holiday that we're headed into. So I kind of think of price as the like primary tentpole. But in order to differentiate, I think what we're doubling down on is what we do, that is different than anyone else just given who we are. We are agnostic to the customer. So we don't care what the operating system is or who makes the hardware. We're there for the customer to help them to build on that. We have what we like to call human-enabled services. So we can help you in the store. We can consult for you in your home. We can repair. We can take back. We can trade in. You can buy open box. You can go to an outlet. Like, we just have the huge end-to-end variety of solutions all the way from inspire to support, so that's the kind of second differentiator for us. And then third, I think we're building on those things with a unique membership program with unique offers that reach out to our members with a membership program that's based on the things that we uniquely do well. And then fourth, I have to give major credit to our vendor partners as well, even though we're in a little bit of a slower innovation cycle, they remain closely committed to our success, which means we do have everything from the most new beautiful 98-inch TV that's out on the floor, all the way to those opening price point Chromebooks or opening price point televisions that might be right for you at a value play. And I think our ability to showcase those high and new experience as well as all the way through the rest of the assortment really is that last differentiating piece for us. Yeah. So we remain really excited about the Health business, and we were pretty clear that we had pulled the FY '25 targets on the whole or as the macro backdrop has changed. And so we are, of course, working behind the scenes to really fortify that business for the future. And I know someone had asked earlier as we think about the puts and takes for next year, we would continue to expect Health to become more accretive, and we laid that out as kind of our structural thesis at our Investor Day. And that part of the thesis remains true for us. And while it still is relatively small at this point, we are seeing some nice uptick, particularly in that kind of care-at-home side of things, where we've announced partnerships with Geisinger and with Atrium Health as we think about how we can use our unique Geek Squad assets as well as the unique product assortment that we have to help deliver care at home. So again, relatively small, but the team is doing a nice job continuing to ensure that, that part of the business is accretive and grows over time. Good morning. Matt hit on this, but I want to underscore, the way in which our vendors participate with us varies as you would expect, depending on what we're seeing in the macro. Sometimes that shows up as more promotional partnership. But a lot of times, that shows up in very different ways it can be in how we think about specialized labor, it can be in store experiences like we mentioned on the call, it can be in our Best Buy ads business or in supply chain fulfillment or in services. And I think what's important is our overall level of invested support has grown in the aggregate even as we compare it to pre-pandemic levels. And I think that is the part that for us as important is how can we be the very best partner to our vendors as we collectively want to bring, especially some of this newer innovation to market. Yeah. As it relates -- you hit on specifically device life cycle management, I'm maybe going to take it up one level and that is, we've talked about Geek Squad as a service, because it can be everything from device cycle management, which is newer side of this, but also just providing service on behalf of vendors as you think about being an Apple authorized service provider or some of our Best Buy business offerings where we actually use our service profile to go out and do installations writ large. What's nice about an initiative like this is it doesn't require, especially in the earlier stages, much incremental investment. We already have Geek Squad City, which is a very large facility, well staffed with trained experts who we can leverage some of their capacities in order to deliver on something like device life cycle management. Now then we can make decisions as something like that ramps. We didn't mention it this quarter because in Q4, honestly, it's not the biggest front and center area of focus. But you can also imagine behind the scenes, if there are other ways for us to leverage our existing expertise and capacity. Those are very interesting strategic initiatives for us. And we remain excited about this one. We remain excited about the pipeline that we're seeing in this one. And obviously, I think you can expect that we will update you with more clarity as it develops. So with that, I think that -- thank you. I think that is our last question, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. Thank you for the nice wishes. I hope you all also have a wonderful holiday, and we look forward to updating you all on our results and progress during our next call in February. Thank you, and have a great day."

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us. Today we are reporting better-than-expected Q2 financial results. Our comparable sales came in at the high end of our guidance and profitability was better than expected. These results continue to demonstrate our strong operational execution as we balance our reaction to the current industry sales pressure with our ongoing strategic investments. As expected, our year-over-year comparable sales performance improved from the 10% decline we reported last quarter. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 6.2%. We expanded our Q2 gross profit rate 110 basis points from last year due to better product margins and profitability improvements in our membership program. We kept our SG&A expenses flat while absorbing higher incentive compensation expenses than we recorded last year. Our industry continues to experience lower consumer demand due to the pandemic pull-forward of tech purchases and the shift back into services spend outside the home like travel and entertainment. In addition, of course, persistent inflation has impacted spending decisions for a substantial part of the population. I continue to be incredibly proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future in light of the industry pressure and ongoing uncertain macro conditions. We strategically managed our promotional plan and we're price-competitive in an environment where consumers are very deal focused and the level of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and often and above pre-pandemic fiscal '20. In the first half of the year, our purchasing, customer behavior has remained relatively consistent in terms of demographics and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down compared to last year in line with our sales decline as the team continues to manage inventory strategically targeting approximately 60 days of forward supply. Our customer satisfaction with product availability has been improving over the past few years and is now the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic. I would note that while we were not a perfect inventory levels last year, we were more rightsized than many and are not lapping the kind of clearance pressure that other retailers experienced. We continue to make it easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Almost one-third of our domestic revenue came from our digital assets including our mobile app. We have made considerable improvements to our app customer experience and the percent of our online sales coming through the app has doubled in just the last three years to more than 20% of our online revenue. We are pleased to see higher app usage overall as our app customers engage three times more often than customers engaging with us on other digital platforms. Our Buy Online Pickup In Store percent of online sales continues to be just over 40%, considering the speed of our delivery with almost 60% of packages delivered within two days, we believe the consistency of our high rate of instore pickup by our customers truly underscores the importance of the combination of our digital and physical locations. In addition, our focus on providing customers with expertise and support continues to be highlighted by material improvements and satisfaction scores for our in-store and in-home tech services as well as our home delivery experience. In fact, our remote support services, where we have the ability to remotely access and fixed your computer while you're at home has the highest NPS of all our experiences and continues to increase. These are all services we can provide at scale that no one else can. Our tech services play a material role in our unique membership program that is driving increased customer engagements and increased share of wallet. As we would expect, paid members also report much higher customer satisfaction than nonmembers. During the quarter, we successfully launched significant changes to our program designed to give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget, and lifestyle. In addition, we wanted to build in more flexibility and drive a lower cost to serve than our previous Total Tech program. We now offer three tears; My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. It is of course very early as we only launched the new programs on June 27th, but we are seeing indicators that the program changes are driving many of the results we expect it, including an uptick in year-over-year growth of overall paid membership sign-ups. For example, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total Tech offer continues to resonate more strongly in our physical stores setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store remote phone or chat on all your electronics, no matter where you purchase them. It also includes two years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases. In addition, it includes all the benefits included in My Best Buy Plus. And as a reminder, My Best Buy Plus is a new membership tier built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly-anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60-day return in exchange window on most products. In the first several weeks since launch, this plan is resonating more with digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments across more product categories than My Best Buy Total, and its predecessor, Total Tech. We are still very early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers and continuously improving the digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Lastly, our My Best Buy tier remains our free plan built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account like online access to purchase history, order tracking, and fast checkout. At the beginning of the year, we added the free shipping benefit and phased out the points-based rewards benefit for non-credit card holders. As a reminder, our credit card holders still have the option to earn 5% back in rewards or choose 12 months, 18 months, or even 24 months of 0% interest-rate financing depending on the product category. The customer metrics continue to validate our decisions to change our free tier and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the financial impact has been better than we originally modeled. For fiscal '24, we now expect our three-tiered membership program to contribute at least 25 basis points of Enterprise Year-over-Year operating income rate expansion, which is consistent with what we have seen in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our journey to evolve our omnichannel capability. We want to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. This means our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to be more cost and capital-efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 physical store plans we announced at the beginning of the year. These include closing 20 to 30 stores, implementing eight large-format 35,000-square-foot Experience Store remodels, and expanding our outlet stores from 19 to around 25. In addition, of course, we are continuing to refresh our stores. For fiscal '24, we are particularly focused on improving the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, in all our stores, we are installing new premium end-caps in partnership with key vendors that will improve the merchandising in the center of the store. These new end-caps have that product and vendor story on the front with the inventory tucked in on the sides. Importantly, it allows us to have a great demo or presentation, even if we are displaying potentially less in-store inventory than we historically have. This also allows for a much better merchandising experience for products that we have deemed more at risk for shrink and have decided to hold inventory in a more secure location off the sales floor. We invested in digital tools that allow the customer to quickly scan and pick up this inventory in a matter of minutes through our prioritized pick process. This minimizes shrink, prioritizes the customer experience, and drives a much more efficient employee process. In addition, in about half our stores we are rightsizing our traditional gaming and digital imaging spaces to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as green works cordless power tools, wellness products like the Oura Ring, Epson short throw-projectors, e-bikes and scooters, and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market-share growth. As it relates to the operating model in our stores, we are continuing to drive our evolution based on two overarching goals. First, we needed to more efficiently allocate our labor cost considering the higher online sales have resulted in a decline in physical store traffic and sales. Our customers and their expectations and behaviors have changed dramatically and incredibly quickly. We have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and employees. In our roles and the associated hourly pay are the same and we have had to make some difficult but strategic decisions to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately. As we mentioned last quarter, with our most recent changes, we were able to add approximately 2 million additional hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year and we saw improvements in our associate availability NPS metric in the second quarter as a result. Because of these structural changes, we have driven more than 100 basis points of rate improvement in domestic store labor expense as a percent of revenue compared to fiscal '20. Additionally, we have been successful in keeping our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. Second, we need to provide our employees flexibility, predictability, and opportunities to gain more skills. We have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. As you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles. The vast majority of which we hire internally. Our retail workforce has led through significant change over the past four years. I could not be more proud of how our teams have adapted to the changing environment. But all that change, while necessary can be hard and disruptive for any team. We are pleased to be headed into a period of stability from an operating model perspective and we are now laser-focused on ensuring foundational retail excellence. As such, during Q2, we led thousands of employees, including more than 80% of our sales associates through a certification process, focused on our baseline expectations for interacting with customers, our selling model, and product category proficiency. This is just Phase 1 and we will continue to invest in training hours for subsequent phases of the program to make sure we are driving the interactions and outcomes, we believe are the best for our customers and our business. As I mentioned earlier, we are working hard to balance our response to current industry conditions with our need to invest in our future. It has long been part of our cultural DNA to drive cost efficiencies and expense reductions in order to offset pressures and fund investments and this year is no different. In fiscal '24, we are driving benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment, and our omnichannel operations. This includes leveraging technology and rapidly evolving AI. For example, in customer care, our virtual agents are now answering 40% of customer questions via chat without a human agent and with high satisfaction levels. We are continuing to add capabilities and are creating additional employee and customer-facing virtual agents that will simplify our most complex interactions like technology support services, while also delivering key insights from our customer care centers back into the enterprise. We are also testing new state-of-the-art routing capabilities to optimize our in-home operations, reducing cost-of-service and improving the availability and wait time of delivery and installation appointments for our customers. As we think about our growth strategies, we believe we can leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams. In this vein, we are exploring Geek Squad as a service opportunities with several large companies, including Accenture, Intel, and Lenovo as we have created differentiated B2C and B2B services capability. Device lifecycle management is a specific example of the service we can provide to others and necessity for all companies, device lifecycle management refers to the process of providing tech devices like phones and laptops to employees. This is not a core competency for most companies and the recent hybridization of work has made it even more complicated. We are already supporting a number of firms as their sole device lifecycle management partner providing end-to-end support of these company-provided devices, including procurement, provisioning, deployment, repair, and end-of-life. This is just one example of our ability to leverage our data and assets and adds to the growth we're already seeing in areas like Best Buy Ads and Partner Plus. Before my closing remarks, I also want to take a moment to recognize our Geek Squad teams for their work with our communities. For more than 15 years, they have been sharing and teaching their tech expertise and skills to prepare the next generation for the future workforce. This summer, we welcomed more than 2,000 kids and teens at nearly 40 Geek Squad Academy camps across the country. These camps give participants the opportunity to learn skills on everything from coding, game design, digital music, and more. More importantly, they help young people build self-confidence, spark creativity, and discover how technology can benefit them in their educational pursuits in future careers. I am incredibly proud of all our Geek Squad agents and volunteers for their work this summer inspiring thousands of young minds through tech. As we enter the second half of the year and look forward to the holiday season, we are both proud pragmatic, and optimistic. Of course, the macro-environment remains uncertain with a number of tailwinds and headwinds soon including the October resumption of student loan payments, all of which results in uneven impacts on consumers. Overarchingly, we believe that the consumer is in a good place. But as we have said, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their household. During last conference call, we noted that we were preparing for a number of scenarios within our annual guidance range, and we believed our sales were aligning closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. We knew it would be a challenging year for the industry and we are halfway through the year and narrowing our outlook largely as expected. As Matt will discuss in more detail, we are updating our comparable sales guidance accordingly. We now expect comparable sales to decline in the range of 4.5% to 6%. This compares to our previous range of down 3% to down 6%. At the same time, we are narrowing our profitability ranges effectively raising the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for non-GAAP operating income rate and earnings per share. We continue to expect that this year will be the low point in tech demand after two years of sales declines. Tech is a bigger part of all our lives, both in our homes and in our businesses than ever, and we believe next year the consumer electronics industry should see stabilization and possibly growth driven by the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bought early in the pandemic and the normalization of tech innovation. Let me say a few words about the fourth quarter specifically. For context, we reported a comparable sales decline of 10% for fiscal '23 and roughly 8% for the first half of this year. We are guiding a Q3 year-over-year comparable sales decline that are similar to or a little better than the 6.2% decline we just reported for Q2. Our full-year guidance implies a wide range for Q4 comparable sales of down 3% to slightly positive. There are a number of factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales will improve and could potentially turn positive. We expect growth in-home theater as we expect to be better-positioned with inventory across all price points and budget spends last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our home theater business. For example, TV sales trends improved in Q2 and units returned to growth. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build-on our position of strength in the premium assortment will not exactly linear. We are also starting to see signs of stabilization in this category as Q2 laptop sales trends improved materially and units were flat to last year. We expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there is a promising slate of new software titles expected to be released in the back half of the year. We are planning for potential growth in the mobile phone category as we expect inventory to be less constrained than last year and expect to drive growth in our unlocked phones business. Our hypothesis regarding the holiday season is that the consumer largely returns to pre-pandemic behavior. By this, we mean that they will be looking for great deals and convenience and traffic will be weighted toward promotional events. We have an excellent team and strong omnichannel assets that thrive in such an environment. In summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continue to drive volatility as we move through the year, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve and we remain incredibly excited about our future opportunities. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access, and of course generative AI where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement. As the largest CE specialty retailer with one-third of the U.S. computing and television market share, we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else can. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for some more details on our second quarter results and our fiscal '24 outlook.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our second quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.6 billion declined 6.2% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rates of 3.8% declined 30 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year and increased approximately 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was 110 basis-point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $1.22 decreased $0.32 or 21%, with approximately half of the decrease due to a higher effective tax rate. When viewing our performance versus our expectations entering the quarter, our revenue was at the high end of the range we provided. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate driven by a number of areas including lower cost to serve our membership offerings, higher profit-sharing revenue from our private-label credit card arrangement, and lower supply-chain costs. Next, I will walk through the details on our second-quarter results compared to last year. From an Enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, June's decline of approximately 5% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis with May and July both down approximately 7%. As we've started Q3, our estimated comparable sales decline in the first four weeks of August was approximately 6%. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 7.1% to $8.9 million driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, home theater, computing, and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, consistent with the past several quarters, our overall blended average selling price declined in the low-single digits as a percentage versus last year. In our International segment, revenue decreased 8.8% to $693 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.4% and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 23.1%, a higher gross profit rate was driven by the following. First, our product margin rates improved versus last year. The better product margin rates included a higher level of vendor-supported promotions, and the benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas. Second, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. And third, an improved gross profit rate from our health initiatives. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A dollars were flat to last year as higher incentive compensation was largely offset by reduced store payroll costs. Moving next to capital expenditures where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of $80 million compared to last year with lower store-related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $560 million to shareholders through dividends of $402 million and share repurchases of $158 million. We expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24 with the level of share repurchases being slightly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. As I referenced earlier, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26.6% was higher than the 16.7% rate last year. The lower effective tax rate last year it was primarily due to the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Now, I would like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As Corie mentioned, we are lowering the high end of our full-year revenue outlook to our previous midpoint while keeping the low end of our revenue guidance unchanged. At the same time, we are narrowing our non-GAAP LOI rate and EPS ranges in a way that raises the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for those items. Let me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions starting with revenue. We expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $44.5 billion. Enterprise comparable sales decline of 4.5% to 6%. Moving on to our full-year profitability guidance, which is Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.40. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax of approximately 24.5% and for interest and income to exceed interest expense this year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect this extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million of SG&A. We still expect it to benefit our full-year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. Next, I will review our full-year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions. We now expect our full-year gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23 which compares to our prior outlook of 40 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion. The primary drivers of the rate expansion include the following. First, improvement from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide at least 25 basis points of improvement. Second, higher product margin rates, which includes the benefits from our optimization efforts across multiple areas, any higher level of vendor-supported promotions. And third, our health initiatives is also expected to improve our gross profit rate. Lastly, we expect the profit-sharing from our private-label credit card to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year. The profit-sharing has provided a slight benefit to our gross profit rate in the first half of the year, which is expected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year. Now, moving to our SG&A expectations. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation, as we lapped the very low levels last year. The high-end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $185 million compared to fiscal '23. We continue to expect store payroll and advertising expenses to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the third quarter, we expect our comparable sales to be slightly better than the negative 6.2% we reported for the second quarter. On the profitability side, we expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3.4%. This would represent a decline of approximately 50 basis points versus last year with the contributions from SG&A and gross profit, pretty similar to what we saw in the second quarter. Lastly, I'll share some color on what our guidance implies for the fourth quarter. As Corie discussed, we are planning for multiple revenue scenarios that range from a comparable sales decline of approximately 3% to slightly positive. Our Q4 gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year, but not at the same level as we are expecting for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be more favorable than our full-year outlook, which is primarily due to the extra week and the more favorable revenue outlook. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Scot Ciccarelli. Good morning, guys. Corie, you mentioned some of the newer technology kind of waiting in the wings with AI and stuff. Can you give the group, any kind of flavor for some of the technologies like generically that you guys are thinking about that could potentially drive improvement in sales trends?\nCorie Barry: Yes, maybe in this, we were talking about computing specifically, and maybe I'll give just a little bit more color there. I mean I think what we're seeing broadly is that computing innovations and the refresh cycles are getting shorter and they are accelerating and we continue to see people using all of their devices more often and far more like a computing processing intensive. And these are really specific activities and you can see both whether you're using it at home, and you're seeing a lot more streaming, or whether using it at work and you're starting to want to leverage some of these more advanced technologies. Obviously, like, for example, Microsoft pre-pandemic focused on dual screen and that was kind of something we had talked about for a while, but they quickly pivoted some of their developments within their Windows OS to address consumer productivity where all of us, we're kind of struggling to make sure we're as productive as possible on multiple devices, a lot of that enhancement went into productivity and I think the emergence of AI is at the heart of many of these innovations. I think in this case, in this example, it centers around the Windows copilot on Windows 11, which brings ChatGPT and AI innovations in the cloud applications within that Windows Office Suite within PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel. And I think what we're expecting will happen and I alluded to it on the call is obviously you're going to have likely at some points here different generation of technology that's going to have more intensively leverage the capabilities that are necessary to run these AI models. I think that's one example. We talk about this often, Scot. It's hard for us always to know exactly what that new horizon of technology is going to be, but this is one that probably has some of the broadest implications for all of our collective productivity.\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes, understood. And then thank you for that. And then the second question is the expectation for slight improvement in comp despite a little bit more difficult comparison. Is that really driven by you have more events in the third quarter than the second quarter as we revert to pre-pandemic kind of behavior?\nMatt Bilunas: No, I think for Q4 specifically, I think as we think about improvement of trends for Q3 and then in Q4, I think we are obviously encouraged by a little bit by back to school. Back to school has been slightly better than we expected as we get into Q3. When you think about Q3 compared to FY '20, it actually has slightly higher growth than what we saw in -- expecting slightly higher growth in Q3 compared to Q2. Q3 compared to '20 has a little bit more holiday sales pulled in. So we are expecting that to continue compared to where pre-pandemic was, but maybe not to the same extent of pull-forward that we've seen in the last few years, so I think we're encouraged by the trends as we leave Q2 if you think about what happened in Q2, we actually saw some stabilization in our business, we saw actually laptop units turned to flat in Q2 in terms of that business and TV units were flat, and so I think there is optimism around how -- what we might expect for the back-half and more specifically Q4 but Q3 we're likely still seeing similar levels to what we saw in Q2.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nGreg Melich: Thanks. I wanted to start on the top-line, that sort of improvement in trends and I love an update on what credit as the penetration and also you mentioned that that was a tailwind, becoming a headwind. Could you frame that a little bit more as to what percentage of gross profit it is or something like that?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I think for the -- on the credit side specifically, first, we've talked about the credit card portfolio is 1.4 of our domestic sales. 1.4%, so it's pretty similar to what we had said last time. I think overall what we've been seeing for the last number of years is a tailwind for the credit card portfolio of profit share. It certainly -- it came in a little better than we expected in Q2. We are seeing net credit losses normalize to where they were pre-pandemic. I think the thing we're watching for which is based on the state of consumer do this net credit-losses actually turned to higher than they used to be, which would create pressure on the profit share. And in the back half of this year, we are expecting it to be a slight pressure compared to the first part of the year being a benefit for us, but neutral for the year. So it's really that net credit losses is one aspect we're watching, especially as we get into next year. And we think about what the state of the consumer does look like as we get into next year and increasing levels of debt. So still an amazing book and partnership for us in terms of what it does for our consumers and offering a great way to pay for product. It actually also has a very loyal consumer. So we're really happy with the party, just the reality of what we've been trying to normalize a bit, if you will, from the last few years. I think to the improving trends, I think Q3 we're expecting to be a pretty similar, maybe slightly better comp than we saw in Q2. Like I said earlier, back to school is a little better than we expected, but it's running a little longer and little later into the season. And then as you look to Q4, while we are expecting the year-over-year comps improved to at the bottom of the range of minus 3 or the top slightly positive and it still does represent the fact that against FY '20, anywhere from down 7% to down 3% on the high end. So, yes, we believe the year-over-year trend should improve based on a number of the things that Corie mentioned, it still does represent a more stabilization of our consumers. As you look into the back half, the way to think about a more normalized volume that we had pre-pandemic.\nGreg Melich: Got it. And then my follow-up is on SG&A specifically. I know you expect it delever for the year. You mentioned the incentive comp up $185 million, was that for the full year or in the back half?\nMatt Bilunas: That would be for the full year. Yes, that's for the full year.\nGreg Melich: And that's more back-half weighted, presumably?\nMatt Bilunas: It's pretty even throughout the year.\nGreg Melich: Okay. And then in terms of leveraging payroll that 100 bps was in the second quarter, was there something about the second quarter that gave you an unusual amounts of hourly payroll leverage, or should we expect that going forward?\nMatt Bilunas: No, I think for the year, we expect store payroll to be relatively flat on a percentage of sales basis for the whole year. It has been pretty consistent across, but has been pretty consistent across the quarters, and we would expect it to be pretty consistent in the back half of the year as well.\nCorie Barry: And, Greg, just to make sure we're clear that 100 basis points as versus FY '20. So that's more than like structural change that we've seen over the last four-ish years.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you. Appreciate that. Well, good luck, everyone.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSeth Sigman: Hi, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on that credit point. So neutral for the year, negative in the second half of the year slightly. Can you just size up for us what normal means if that continues into next year? I think your disclosure is that, it's up 50 basis points or so since fiscal 2020, so does normal mean that fully reversed is how do we think about that?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. I think my reference to normal. Thanks for the question is more related to net credit losses as a percentage to the book. So we haven't given that number. I won't give it today, but what we're seeing now is a more normal rate compared to FY '20. What we're watching for is it does that rate increase compared to where it used to be and certainly it's already higher than it has been the last few years when the net credit losses were very low rate. And that is just more to do with just the state of the consumer. So right now we still see a relatively good consumer to the extent that they are still continuing to make tradeoff decisions weighing a little bit more pressure on their personal finances that could less to go up into next year. That's the consideration. We will certainly, as we think about next year, we're not guiding next year, but we're thinking about next year, that could be one of the pressures we face as we think about ROI rate just in terms of where does the net credit losses go.\nSeth Sigman: Okay, thank you for that. Just any other perspective on credit availability today if that's impacting demand in any way? And maybe just put that in context of some of the trends that you may be seeing across consumer cohorts or markets, obviously, you talked about some of the bright spots you've seen in recent months here and what you're expecting for the rest of the year. I'm just trying to think about some of the incremental consumer headwinds ahead whether that is student loans or credit availability? Just any other context around some of the consumer behavior you may be seeing where that's coming from?\nCorie Barry: Yes, right now as it relates specifically to the card, we aren't seeing massive change in credit availability. We're continuing to see and we've said before, about 25% of our business is done on the card. We're continuing to see those trends. And what are the nice things about our card is as I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I want to emphasize that you can either choose points or you can choose 0% financing and so it's actually it's an offering that is widely accepted and appreciated, especially against the backdrop so the consumer can decide what's more relevant for them. So like Matt said, we're seeing more of a normalization in some of those key metrics. But in general, it remains an incredibly efficient asset for us in partnership, obviously in the profit share structure that we have.\nSeth Sigman: Great. Thanks, guys.\nCorie Barry: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thank you. Just a question on appliances, which looked like they were particularly weak this quarter and some other big-box retailers that sell appliances have talked about an increase in vendor-funded incentives and promotions. Have you seen the same behavior from your vendor partners as they try to respond to slower demand and did vendor funding funded promotions have an impact on margins this quarter?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, broadly speaking, we are seeing an increase in vendor-funded promotions across all of our categories and I think appliances would be part of that. I think as we noted in our gross profit rate improvement in Q2, a lot of that was coming from our product margin rates being better year-over-year. Part of that, we're seeing an uptick in the vendor-supported promotions that we are running. So yes, it is a more promotional environment year-over-year and in some cases, certainly more than it was in FY '20, but it hasn't manifested in lower product margins for us. We are seeing both not just us, our vendors wanting to engage in promotional activity to drive and stimulate demand.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thank you. And just on the flip side of some of the categories that were particularly strong. Can you just go into a little more detail on what was successful and like the entertainment and services categories and where you see that going in the next couple of quarters?\nCorie Barry: Well, on the entertainment side of things, that really is reflective of gaming and particularly gaming hardware, which had a much more stable supply this year than what we saw last year, so, we feel like that's a nice indicator as we're heading into the back half of the year. We mentioned that. And on the services side, that really is mainly reflective of our membership offering and now starting to kind of annualize that higher, larger cohorts of members.\nLiz Suzuki: Great, thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Matt, you alluded to operating margin pressure in the next fiscal year. So on a similar level of revenue for Best Buy, call it 2024 versus where it was in 2019, what would be the company's operating margin rate in light of the pressure that it's experienced from investments in health care and some of the impact of the rise in e-commerce penetration for the business and all the actions that the company has taken to try and preserve the profitability in light of those pressures? And what levers can be pulled from here in order to improve the operating margin rate over time, especially as things like credit income continue to decline?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. What I just to clarify when I was referring to specifically was potential pressure on the credit card profit share as we look into next year, but I wasn't trying to characterize was like overall allied pressure for next year. But to get to your broad question there, I think, as you can appreciate, we're not going to guide next year. But that being said, if for example, our sales were flat next year as some of the indicators would suggest it would be our expectation or our goal to at least hold LOI rate flat if not drive a little bit of expansion. Like I said, there were few factors here. The first being that credit card. It's been a tailwind for us. And like I said, it could turn to some pressure. The second more tactical one is as we enter into next year, we always reset incentive compensation this year. We have a certain amount of that next year, but we reset the one that does sometimes create a little bit of rate pressure, but broadly speaking, if you think about next year and the years outward, a lot of the other drivers are going to be things like the industry -- level of industry growth. So the extent that the industry can grow and does grow, we expect to grow with it. And that does create SG&A leverage as our cost structure today is probably more indicative of a sales number that's higher than what we set. But we've talked about this year being a benefit for us, both the membership and the health initiatives the rate has been improving, so similar to our Investor Day, a while back we would expect those initiatives to continue to improve in terms of rate, as we look forward from here on out. So into next year and in the years after both membership and health will continue to help drive a year-over-year improvement. We also obviously always trying to have a cost takeout initiatives to help mitigate pressures that we face and just help us invest in the right places. But again, like I said, the profit share could become a pressure from an NCL. The other thing to note in terms of the profit share is this potential regulatory changes around late fees. Now, it's too early to know whether those do or don't count, but that's another item to note. And lastly, I don't think I had mentioned this. We're still in a consumer environment where it's a little uneven and steady and so I think as we think about going forward, a lot of it will depend -- the industry growth will depend upon that consumer and where they choose to spend their money, but I think like I said, our goal would be to at least maintain a flat rate, if not grow a little bit, if we have flat sales, for example.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much. My follow-up question is, there is an interesting dynamic that you're referring to on your call, which is the promotional environment in some cases is higher or more intense than it was in 2019, but you're getting more vendor funding than you were getting at least relative to last year. So A, how much is your vendor funding up or down relative to 2019, and B, what does this overall promotional environment suggest about the profit pool for selling consumer electronics in the United States in Best Buy's share of that overall profit pool? Thank you very much.\nCorie Barry: So, question one, overall vendor trading up for now. We're not going to say total amounts of vendor funding, but you can imagine, at any given point in time our vendors like us are trying to think in a very omnichannel way how best can we both stimulate demand and complete excellent customer experiences. When we kind of like look all in at everything our vendors do with us, we feel confident that we have at least as much if not more like total funding in partnership with our vendors, but of course they're going to use different pockets depending on the environment that we fit in. I think on your profit pool question, Michael, what's interesting is our vendors and we've said this for a long time. Our vendors are as interested as we are in stimulating consumer demand. Sometimes that means they lean highly into innovation and trying to drive replacement cycles and trying to drive that incremental demand through innovation. Sometimes that means we partner closely together in how we show up in stores, whether that's physically or in labor, and then sometimes that means, we will partner together in highly promotional or value-oriented periods to make sure, collectively, we are putting our best foot forward and it goes back to some of what I ended my comments with. There is a larger installed base of consumer electronics out there. And this is not static equipment we all have. This is equipment that whether or not you want to upgrade it, sometimes just wears out and breaks. And this is our unique place in this consumer electronics industry. In partnership with our vendors, we are arguably the best to commercializing that new technology or bringing kind of this total story agnostic just carrying about the customer to life and I think what you're seeing is this in this period right now, our ability to help drive value in partnership with our customers is really highlighted.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much, and good luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. We wanted to ask a little bit more about the membership strategy, which is now in three tiers. Can you talk about how the profitability differs when compared to your previous program of Total Tech Support and does this profitability improve as the program scales and ramps?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. Yes, I think the changes we've made to the membership program have had a positive impact on our OI rate this year. I think we've talked about it being at least 25 basis points for the year. It's coming from a few different areas. The first area, I would say is the changes we've made to the My Best Buy program, the free membership where we move points away from that program, which is solely on the credit card that helps drive some improvement in rate. The cumulative growth in the members is also a place where that actually helps improve our margin rates as well. So the growth in the annual membership fees does drive some of the improvement as well. Lastly, the changes we've made to the Total Tech program and turned into my Best Buy Total, it does lower the cost to fulfill and helps to drive an improved gross margin rate as well. So those are the collection that drive the at least 25 basis points. And then Corie can speak to any sort of strategic things around the membership team.\nCorie Barry: I think what's most important is that at any given point in time, what the team I would argue has done a magnificent job doing is balancing acquisition, retention, and engagement. And while to Matt's point, cost to serve as part of our considerations. What we want are not just to acquire a bunch of members but to make sure they are incredibly engaged and to make sure we retain them over time. And so while the profitability impact is part of what we're looking at, the bigger question we are actually looking at is, what is that combination of acquisition, retention, and engagement that drives what we talked about, which is more sticky customers that bring a larger share of wallet and help keep Best Buy relevant over time.\nKate McShane: Thank you. And then a follow-up question was just around market share. We wondered if you've been seeing any kind of meaningful change here, whether it would be sequentially or just in any specific categories?\nCorie Barry: So the good news is, overall, we feel very strongly about our position in the industry and we talked about it already a bit. We are confident in our relationship with our vendors and grateful for their partnership and I think we continue to be excited to keep investing in our strategy from a position of strength. We've said before, there is not a great single source for market share, both because we have a large portfolio of services. Also because we are always evolving new categories, but from what we can see in some of the more established categories, we have at least held our share in Q2 and we believe that's been true really the first half of the year. So no major trajectory change. We feel like we're positioned well and obviously, the team will continue to work with our vendor partners and ensure that we have that great valuable assortment for our customers.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Thomas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about kind of inflation, deflation. And what you've been seeing of late, and how you're thinking about that in the back half of the year, particularly given the inflationary world that we've all been living in, but this backdrop of consumer electronics that has historically have been deflationary? Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I think broadly speaking, let's start with the categories. I think what we said from a product perspective, we certainly have seen a little bit inflation over the years. But what we're now seeing actually is more promotionality on a year-over-year basis in some cases compared to FY '20, so from category product perspective, I think we're kind of beyond past the inflation aspects that there isn't some cost of good increase, but generally speaking, the prices have gone up. So I think that hasn't changed too much outside like sometimes more promotionality is dropping that price on a year-over-year basis. I think for inflation in other areas in terms of cost, there are things that are historically have always had a little inflation there, probably it will continue to go up. Wages is an area where we always expect to have a little inflation, marketing also is a place where you see some pretty consistent inflation over the years. Supply chain is the more notable one that I think we're seeing a lot of inflation over the years and now it's starting to subside a little bit. Supply-chain has a number of different areas, one of them being the ocean side of supply-chain. That's the smallest cost that we have and that's an area where inflation actually has come down. Ground transportation or domestic transportation actually is an area where we are still seeing a higher level of inflation based on the wages that have the wage pressures and just the volume that's increased. The warehousing side of supply-chain is also an area where we've seen inflation and would probably expect to continue to see some. We also have wage inflation on the warehousing side, but also just we've expanded our footprint because our large products have grown in terms of the mix of our categories that we did it to add space. So broadly speaking, there are some areas where we probably continue to see inflation and some areas that will abate a little bit as you get into next year and years out.\nCorie Barry: Brad, explicitly I want to highlight. We started talking about this category becoming promotional again in the fall of 2021. And so this is a category very different than some of what you're hearing and I'll just use an example like a number, where you're starting to see that pullback. That is not the case here, but structurally, we have seen ASPs increase. So to your point about this is generally seen as a deflationary category. We spent some time talking on the last call about the fact that actually over time, it is not necessarily deflationary because every single new Rev of products carries with it a new and different price tag. So actually, over the longer period, when we look back to FY '20, we have seen structural increases in ASP, but that is due more to our premium mix and it's do more to having got more high ASP products like appliances and home theater. And so, I just want to make sure I'm explicit in saying this is a bit of a different category on the pricing side of things. Matt did an exceptional job on some of the costing side of things, but we're in a different place than many other industries and categories.\nBrad Thomas: That's really helpful. Thanks. Thank you both. And if I could squeeze in one follow-up here around the topic of shrink. Corie, you mentioned some of the new displays you have that have been helpful. But can you just help to put into context the success that you're seeing in this tough environment given that there are so many retailers calling out challenges on shrink right now?\nCorie Barry: Yes. I will start with our number one priority is and always has been the safety of our customers and our employees. And I need to be clear that in certain parts of the country in certain stores do that attempt that whether it's breaking in or whether it's larger-scale just grabbing and running out that those are real and we are definitely seeing an increase. However, we did not call-out material impacts to the business as a result of shrink pressure. And as we think about the way we think about shrink is overarching everything we call shrink as a percent of revenue, right, because you're kind of trying to gauge it versus the volume and in total, our shrink as a percent of our revenue is within 10 basis-points of pre pandemic fiscal '20 now, I give our teams all the credit in the world around us, and one of the things that's a little bit different here at Best Buy is given the high-ticket nature of what we sell, we've been addressing shrink aggressively for honestly many-many years. It's really embedded in the culture and think about some of the things that are different for us, we have front door asset protection in our stores and likely often more floor coverage as well because we just have more employees in our stores and they just do an exceptional job of washing out over our stores, we usually just have one entrants in our stores, we tend to have less self-checkout. We have a very-high digital penetration at 33%, so that's a little bit different. We also have to spend a lot of time on online side, which is a different kind of definition upstream. And so we just have structurally. I think a little bit different and honestly have been investing really heavily in this space over-time. I'm trying to really hard in our buildings, protect our employees and assets. And then as I mentioned, now going into the next realm of technology solutions that are trying to protect the customer experience and make it still seamless for the customer to get everything they want, and at the same time, create the safest possible environment.\nBrad Thomas: Very helpful. Thank you, Corie.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.\nCorie Barry: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: My first question. I think it's a bit of a follow-up to Keith's question just with respect to memberships. So Corie, you spent a lot of time on the call today. Just talking about the ongoing enhancements of membership and you've given some of the nearer-term financial targets, but I guess the question I want to ask is, as we step-back and clearly the big focus for Best Buy. In your minds, what do we play what I don't want to say necessarily say dream the dream, but intermediate longer-term opportunity with membership either providing a financial standpoint more quantifiable or just from an overall consumer engagement standpoint.\nCorie Barry: Yes. I'm going to talk from a consumer engagement lens. The thesis of membership has been consistent since the beginning is to drive customer engagement and increase share of wallet in consumer electronics, that is the end game that we're trying to accomplish, all the more important in an environment where we have plenty of data that says consumers are a little less brand loyal than they've ever been, and so it becomes even more important for us to both create and then maintain this deep relationship with our customers. What we've learned across and I said it before, but ahead again across acquisition, retention, and engagement, what we've learned is different customers value and different cohorts of customers value different qualities in our membership program. And so that's why the tiers of Free, Plus and Total they will appeal to either in the free case, someone who just really wants the convenience of free shipping on everything. On the Total - or on the Plus aspect, excuse me, that's someone who loves convenience and a great value, right, they're going to get the promotions. They're going to get early access and we get 60-day return windows. And then on the total. I want all of that plus. I really value the support aspect of what we deal and the most important output of all of those at the end-of-the-day is that we can see customers who both stay engaged with us and we can see that repeat business, and we can see that increase in share of wallet meeting every time they think about making a purchase in consumer electronics, they just come to us because it's so easy why do you go anywhere else. So that structurally, is what you're trying to build to. Over time, you both want the program itself to be efficient, you wanted to be a reasonable cost of acquisition, but over time, you also want a customer who is shopping with more frequency and ultimately spending more with Best Buy.\nBrian Nagel: No, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up question different topic. We talked about the sale, the expected sales trajectory through the balance of the fiscal year with the expectation that sales will continue to solidify improved maybe work towards that flatline. But you also did call out. I think it was in the prepared comments. The risk of it - if you will is the challenge of this resumption of student loan payments. So, it's obvious topic is starting to get air time. The question. I have is I mean, to what extent you look closely at this. How are you sizing and if you are sizing that potential risk to your sales trajectory here in the near-term.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, thank you. I think it's clearly something we're trying to assess and what we effectively believe we've tried to size that in our guide for the back-half of the year. So it's clearly there are a number of different factors influencing the consumer right now shift to spend the services, their increasing use of credit card, but they're still spending money. So I think it's certainly an impact for us. I think if you look at our demographics, we potentially could be more slightly exposed, but at the same time, we have a demographic that actually has a higher income, who can more afford, increase in the number of student debt payments. So it's something we certainly tried to factor into the back-half for sure, but it's not the only factor that's happening.\nCorie Barry: You bet. Thank you, Brian. We appreciate the questions and overarchingly thank you to everyone who took the time to be with us today. And before we close the call. I want to make sure we acknowledge the wildfires in Maui, but also the wildfires, we've seen in Canada. And those bracing for a hurricane in Florida. Our hearts genuinely go out to those impacted and we are doing all we can to support our employees in all of those impacted areas. Thank you so much for joining us today.\nOperator: That concludes today's Best Buy's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining, and I hope everyone has a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our second quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.6 billion declined 6.2% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rates of 3.8% declined 30 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year and increased approximately 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was 110 basis-point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $1.22 decreased $0.32 or 21%, with approximately half of the decrease due to a higher effective tax rate. When viewing our performance versus our expectations entering the quarter, our revenue was at the high end of the range we provided. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate driven by a number of areas including lower cost to serve our membership offerings, higher profit-sharing revenue from our private-label credit card arrangement, and lower supply-chain costs. Next, I will walk through the details on our second-quarter results compared to last year. From an Enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, June's decline of approximately 5% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis with May and July both down approximately 7%. As we've started Q3, our estimated comparable sales decline in the first four weeks of August was approximately 6%. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 7.1% to $8.9 million driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, home theater, computing, and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, consistent with the past several quarters, our overall blended average selling price declined in the low-single digits as a percentage versus last year. In our International segment, revenue decreased 8.8% to $693 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.4% and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 23.1%, a higher gross profit rate was driven by the following. First, our product margin rates improved versus last year. The better product margin rates included a higher level of vendor-supported promotions, and the benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas. Second, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. And third, an improved gross profit rate from our health initiatives. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A dollars were flat to last year as higher incentive compensation was largely offset by reduced store payroll costs. Moving next to capital expenditures where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of $80 million compared to last year with lower store-related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $560 million to shareholders through dividends of $402 million and share repurchases of $158 million. We expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24 with the level of share repurchases being slightly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. As I referenced earlier, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26.6% was higher than the 16.7% rate last year. The lower effective tax rate last year it was primarily due to the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Now, I would like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As Corie mentioned, we are lowering the high end of our full-year revenue outlook to our previous midpoint while keeping the low end of our revenue guidance unchanged. At the same time, we are narrowing our non-GAAP LOI rate and EPS ranges in a way that raises the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for those items. Let me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions starting with revenue. We expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $44.5 billion. Enterprise comparable sales decline of 4.5% to 6%. Moving on to our full-year profitability guidance, which is Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.40. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax of approximately 24.5% and for interest and income to exceed interest expense this year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect this extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million of SG&A. We still expect it to benefit our full-year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. Next, I will review our full-year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions. We now expect our full-year gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23 which compares to our prior outlook of 40 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion. The primary drivers of the rate expansion include the following. First, improvement from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide at least 25 basis points of improvement. Second, higher product margin rates, which includes the benefits from our optimization efforts across multiple areas, any higher level of vendor-supported promotions. And third, our health initiatives is also expected to improve our gross profit rate. Lastly, we expect the profit-sharing from our private-label credit card to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year. The profit-sharing has provided a slight benefit to our gross profit rate in the first half of the year, which is expected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year. Now, moving to our SG&A expectations. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation, as we lapped the very low levels last year. The high-end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $185 million compared to fiscal '23. We continue to expect store payroll and advertising expenses to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the third quarter, we expect our comparable sales to be slightly better than the negative 6.2% we reported for the second quarter. On the profitability side, we expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3.4%. This would represent a decline of approximately 50 basis points versus last year with the contributions from SG&A and gross profit, pretty similar to what we saw in the second quarter. Lastly, I'll share some color on what our guidance implies for the fourth quarter. As Corie discussed, we are planning for multiple revenue scenarios that range from a comparable sales decline of approximately 3% to slightly positive. Our Q4 gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year, but not at the same level as we are expecting for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be more favorable than our full-year outlook, which is primarily due to the extra week and the more favorable revenue outlook. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. No, I think for Q4 specifically, I think as we think about improvement of trends for Q3 and then in Q4, I think we are obviously encouraged by a little bit by back to school. Back to school has been slightly better than we expected as we get into Q3. When you think about Q3 compared to FY '20, it actually has slightly higher growth than what we saw in -- expecting slightly higher growth in Q3 compared to Q2. Q3 compared to '20 has a little bit more holiday sales pulled in. So we are expecting that to continue compared to where pre-pandemic was, but maybe not to the same extent of pull-forward that we've seen in the last few years, so I think we're encouraged by the trends as we leave Q2 if you think about what happened in Q2, we actually saw some stabilization in our business, we saw actually laptop units turned to flat in Q2 in terms of that business and TV units were flat, and so I think there is optimism around how -- what we might expect for the back-half and more specifically Q4 but Q3 we're likely still seeing similar levels to what we saw in Q2. Yes. I think for the -- on the credit side specifically, first, we've talked about the credit card portfolio is 1.4 of our domestic sales. 1.4%, so it's pretty similar to what we had said last time. I think overall what we've been seeing for the last number of years is a tailwind for the credit card portfolio of profit share. It certainly -- it came in a little better than we expected in Q2. We are seeing net credit losses normalize to where they were pre-pandemic. I think the thing we're watching for which is based on the state of consumer do this net credit-losses actually turned to higher than they used to be, which would create pressure on the profit share. And in the back half of this year, we are expecting it to be a slight pressure compared to the first part of the year being a benefit for us, but neutral for the year. So it's really that net credit losses is one aspect we're watching, especially as we get into next year. And we think about what the state of the consumer does look like as we get into next year and increasing levels of debt. So still an amazing book and partnership for us in terms of what it does for our consumers and offering a great way to pay for product. It actually also has a very loyal consumer. So we're really happy with the party, just the reality of what we've been trying to normalize a bit, if you will, from the last few years. I think to the improving trends, I think Q3 we're expecting to be a pretty similar, maybe slightly better comp than we saw in Q2. Like I said earlier, back to school is a little better than we expected, but it's running a little longer and little later into the season. And then as you look to Q4, while we are expecting the year-over-year comps improved to at the bottom of the range of minus 3 or the top slightly positive and it still does represent the fact that against FY '20, anywhere from down 7% to down 3% on the high end. So, yes, we believe the year-over-year trend should improve based on a number of the things that Corie mentioned, it still does represent a more stabilization of our consumers. As you look into the back half, the way to think about a more normalized volume that we had pre-pandemic. That would be for the full year. Yes, that's for the full year. It's pretty even throughout the year. No, I think for the year, we expect store payroll to be relatively flat on a percentage of sales basis for the whole year. It has been pretty consistent across, but has been pretty consistent across the quarters, and we would expect it to be pretty consistent in the back half of the year as well. Thank you. Appreciate that. Well, good luck, everyone. Thank you. Yes. I think my reference to normal. Thanks for the question is more related to net credit losses as a percentage to the book. So we haven't given that number. I won't give it today, but what we're seeing now is a more normal rate compared to FY '20. What we're watching for is it does that rate increase compared to where it used to be and certainly it's already higher than it has been the last few years when the net credit losses were very low rate. And that is just more to do with just the state of the consumer. So right now we still see a relatively good consumer to the extent that they are still continuing to make tradeoff decisions weighing a little bit more pressure on their personal finances that could less to go up into next year. That's the consideration. We will certainly, as we think about next year, we're not guiding next year, but we're thinking about next year, that could be one of the pressures we face as we think about ROI rate just in terms of where does the net credit losses go. Yes, broadly speaking, we are seeing an increase in vendor-funded promotions across all of our categories and I think appliances would be part of that. I think as we noted in our gross profit rate improvement in Q2, a lot of that was coming from our product margin rates being better year-over-year. Part of that, we're seeing an uptick in the vendor-supported promotions that we are running. So yes, it is a more promotional environment year-over-year and in some cases, certainly more than it was in FY '20, but it hasn't manifested in lower product margins for us. We are seeing both not just us, our vendors wanting to engage in promotional activity to drive and stimulate demand. Thank you. Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. What I just to clarify when I was referring to specifically was potential pressure on the credit card profit share as we look into next year, but I wasn't trying to characterize was like overall allied pressure for next year. But to get to your broad question there, I think, as you can appreciate, we're not going to guide next year. But that being said, if for example, our sales were flat next year as some of the indicators would suggest it would be our expectation or our goal to at least hold LOI rate flat if not drive a little bit of expansion. Like I said, there were few factors here. The first being that credit card. It's been a tailwind for us. And like I said, it could turn to some pressure. The second more tactical one is as we enter into next year, we always reset incentive compensation this year. We have a certain amount of that next year, but we reset the one that does sometimes create a little bit of rate pressure, but broadly speaking, if you think about next year and the years outward, a lot of the other drivers are going to be things like the industry -- level of industry growth. So the extent that the industry can grow and does grow, we expect to grow with it. And that does create SG&A leverage as our cost structure today is probably more indicative of a sales number that's higher than what we set. But we've talked about this year being a benefit for us, both the membership and the health initiatives the rate has been improving, so similar to our Investor Day, a while back we would expect those initiatives to continue to improve in terms of rate, as we look forward from here on out. So into next year and in the years after both membership and health will continue to help drive a year-over-year improvement. We also obviously always trying to have a cost takeout initiatives to help mitigate pressures that we face and just help us invest in the right places. But again, like I said, the profit share could become a pressure from an NCL. The other thing to note in terms of the profit share is this potential regulatory changes around late fees. Now, it's too early to know whether those do or don't count, but that's another item to note. And lastly, I don't think I had mentioned this. We're still in a consumer environment where it's a little uneven and steady and so I think as we think about going forward, a lot of it will depend -- the industry growth will depend upon that consumer and where they choose to spend their money, but I think like I said, our goal would be to at least maintain a flat rate, if not grow a little bit, if we have flat sales, for example. Thank you. Sure. Yes, I think the changes we've made to the membership program have had a positive impact on our OI rate this year. I think we've talked about it being at least 25 basis points for the year. It's coming from a few different areas. The first area, I would say is the changes we've made to the My Best Buy program, the free membership where we move points away from that program, which is solely on the credit card that helps drive some improvement in rate. The cumulative growth in the members is also a place where that actually helps improve our margin rates as well. So the growth in the annual membership fees does drive some of the improvement as well. Lastly, the changes we've made to the Total Tech program and turned into my Best Buy Total, it does lower the cost to fulfill and helps to drive an improved gross margin rate as well. So those are the collection that drive the at least 25 basis points. And then Corie can speak to any sort of strategic things around the membership team. Sure. I think broadly speaking, let's start with the categories. I think what we said from a product perspective, we certainly have seen a little bit inflation over the years. But what we're now seeing actually is more promotionality on a year-over-year basis in some cases compared to FY '20, so from category product perspective, I think we're kind of beyond past the inflation aspects that there isn't some cost of good increase, but generally speaking, the prices have gone up. So I think that hasn't changed too much outside like sometimes more promotionality is dropping that price on a year-over-year basis. I think for inflation in other areas in terms of cost, there are things that are historically have always had a little inflation there, probably it will continue to go up. Wages is an area where we always expect to have a little inflation, marketing also is a place where you see some pretty consistent inflation over the years. Supply chain is the more notable one that I think we're seeing a lot of inflation over the years and now it's starting to subside a little bit. Supply-chain has a number of different areas, one of them being the ocean side of supply-chain. That's the smallest cost that we have and that's an area where inflation actually has come down. Ground transportation or domestic transportation actually is an area where we are still seeing a higher level of inflation based on the wages that have the wage pressures and just the volume that's increased. The warehousing side of supply-chain is also an area where we've seen inflation and would probably expect to continue to see some. We also have wage inflation on the warehousing side, but also just we've expanded our footprint because our large products have grown in terms of the mix of our categories that we did it to add space. So broadly speaking, there are some areas where we probably continue to see inflation and some areas that will abate a little bit as you get into next year and years out. Yes, thank you. I think it's clearly something we're trying to assess and what we effectively believe we've tried to size that in our guide for the back-half of the year. So it's clearly there are a number of different factors influencing the consumer right now shift to spend the services, their increasing use of credit card, but they're still spending money. So I think it's certainly an impact for us. I think if you look at our demographics, we potentially could be more slightly exposed, but at the same time, we have a demographic that actually has a higher income, who can more afford, increase in the number of student debt payments. So it's something we certainly tried to factor into the back-half for sure, but it's not the only factor that's happening."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us. Today we are reporting better-than-expected Q2 financial results. Our comparable sales came in at the high end of our guidance and profitability was better than expected. These results continue to demonstrate our strong operational execution as we balance our reaction to the current industry sales pressure with our ongoing strategic investments. As expected, our year-over-year comparable sales performance improved from the 10% decline we reported last quarter. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 6.2%. We expanded our Q2 gross profit rate 110 basis points from last year due to better product margins and profitability improvements in our membership program. We kept our SG&A expenses flat while absorbing higher incentive compensation expenses than we recorded last year. Our industry continues to experience lower consumer demand due to the pandemic pull-forward of tech purchases and the shift back into services spend outside the home like travel and entertainment. In addition, of course, persistent inflation has impacted spending decisions for a substantial part of the population. I continue to be incredibly proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future in light of the industry pressure and ongoing uncertain macro conditions. We strategically managed our promotional plan and we're price-competitive in an environment where consumers are very deal focused and the level of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and often and above pre-pandemic fiscal '20. In the first half of the year, our purchasing, customer behavior has remained relatively consistent in terms of demographics and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down compared to last year in line with our sales decline as the team continues to manage inventory strategically targeting approximately 60 days of forward supply. Our customer satisfaction with product availability has been improving over the past few years and is now the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic. I would note that while we were not a perfect inventory levels last year, we were more rightsized than many and are not lapping the kind of clearance pressure that other retailers experienced. We continue to make it easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Almost one-third of our domestic revenue came from our digital assets including our mobile app. We have made considerable improvements to our app customer experience and the percent of our online sales coming through the app has doubled in just the last three years to more than 20% of our online revenue. We are pleased to see higher app usage overall as our app customers engage three times more often than customers engaging with us on other digital platforms. Our Buy Online Pickup In Store percent of online sales continues to be just over 40%, considering the speed of our delivery with almost 60% of packages delivered within two days, we believe the consistency of our high rate of instore pickup by our customers truly underscores the importance of the combination of our digital and physical locations. In addition, our focus on providing customers with expertise and support continues to be highlighted by material improvements and satisfaction scores for our in-store and in-home tech services as well as our home delivery experience. In fact, our remote support services, where we have the ability to remotely access and fixed your computer while you're at home has the highest NPS of all our experiences and continues to increase. These are all services we can provide at scale that no one else can. Our tech services play a material role in our unique membership program that is driving increased customer engagements and increased share of wallet. As we would expect, paid members also report much higher customer satisfaction than nonmembers. During the quarter, we successfully launched significant changes to our program designed to give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget, and lifestyle. In addition, we wanted to build in more flexibility and drive a lower cost to serve than our previous Total Tech program. We now offer three tears; My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. It is of course very early as we only launched the new programs on June 27th, but we are seeing indicators that the program changes are driving many of the results we expect it, including an uptick in year-over-year growth of overall paid membership sign-ups. For example, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total Tech offer continues to resonate more strongly in our physical stores setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store remote phone or chat on all your electronics, no matter where you purchase them. It also includes two years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases. In addition, it includes all the benefits included in My Best Buy Plus. And as a reminder, My Best Buy Plus is a new membership tier built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly-anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60-day return in exchange window on most products. In the first several weeks since launch, this plan is resonating more with digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments across more product categories than My Best Buy Total, and its predecessor, Total Tech. We are still very early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers and continuously improving the digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Lastly, our My Best Buy tier remains our free plan built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account like online access to purchase history, order tracking, and fast checkout. At the beginning of the year, we added the free shipping benefit and phased out the points-based rewards benefit for non-credit card holders. As a reminder, our credit card holders still have the option to earn 5% back in rewards or choose 12 months, 18 months, or even 24 months of 0% interest-rate financing depending on the product category. The customer metrics continue to validate our decisions to change our free tier and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the financial impact has been better than we originally modeled. For fiscal '24, we now expect our three-tiered membership program to contribute at least 25 basis points of Enterprise Year-over-Year operating income rate expansion, which is consistent with what we have seen in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our journey to evolve our omnichannel capability. We want to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. This means our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to be more cost and capital-efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 physical store plans we announced at the beginning of the year. These include closing 20 to 30 stores, implementing eight large-format 35,000-square-foot Experience Store remodels, and expanding our outlet stores from 19 to around 25. In addition, of course, we are continuing to refresh our stores. For fiscal '24, we are particularly focused on improving the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, in all our stores, we are installing new premium end-caps in partnership with key vendors that will improve the merchandising in the center of the store. These new end-caps have that product and vendor story on the front with the inventory tucked in on the sides. Importantly, it allows us to have a great demo or presentation, even if we are displaying potentially less in-store inventory than we historically have. This also allows for a much better merchandising experience for products that we have deemed more at risk for shrink and have decided to hold inventory in a more secure location off the sales floor. We invested in digital tools that allow the customer to quickly scan and pick up this inventory in a matter of minutes through our prioritized pick process. This minimizes shrink, prioritizes the customer experience, and drives a much more efficient employee process. In addition, in about half our stores we are rightsizing our traditional gaming and digital imaging spaces to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as green works cordless power tools, wellness products like the Oura Ring, Epson short throw-projectors, e-bikes and scooters, and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market-share growth. As it relates to the operating model in our stores, we are continuing to drive our evolution based on two overarching goals. First, we needed to more efficiently allocate our labor cost considering the higher online sales have resulted in a decline in physical store traffic and sales. Our customers and their expectations and behaviors have changed dramatically and incredibly quickly. We have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and employees. In our roles and the associated hourly pay are the same and we have had to make some difficult but strategic decisions to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately. As we mentioned last quarter, with our most recent changes, we were able to add approximately 2 million additional hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year and we saw improvements in our associate availability NPS metric in the second quarter as a result. Because of these structural changes, we have driven more than 100 basis points of rate improvement in domestic store labor expense as a percent of revenue compared to fiscal '20. Additionally, we have been successful in keeping our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. Second, we need to provide our employees flexibility, predictability, and opportunities to gain more skills. We have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. As you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles. The vast majority of which we hire internally. Our retail workforce has led through significant change over the past four years. I could not be more proud of how our teams have adapted to the changing environment. But all that change, while necessary can be hard and disruptive for any team. We are pleased to be headed into a period of stability from an operating model perspective and we are now laser-focused on ensuring foundational retail excellence. As such, during Q2, we led thousands of employees, including more than 80% of our sales associates through a certification process, focused on our baseline expectations for interacting with customers, our selling model, and product category proficiency. This is just Phase 1 and we will continue to invest in training hours for subsequent phases of the program to make sure we are driving the interactions and outcomes, we believe are the best for our customers and our business. As I mentioned earlier, we are working hard to balance our response to current industry conditions with our need to invest in our future. It has long been part of our cultural DNA to drive cost efficiencies and expense reductions in order to offset pressures and fund investments and this year is no different. In fiscal '24, we are driving benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment, and our omnichannel operations. This includes leveraging technology and rapidly evolving AI. For example, in customer care, our virtual agents are now answering 40% of customer questions via chat without a human agent and with high satisfaction levels. We are continuing to add capabilities and are creating additional employee and customer-facing virtual agents that will simplify our most complex interactions like technology support services, while also delivering key insights from our customer care centers back into the enterprise. We are also testing new state-of-the-art routing capabilities to optimize our in-home operations, reducing cost-of-service and improving the availability and wait time of delivery and installation appointments for our customers. As we think about our growth strategies, we believe we can leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams. In this vein, we are exploring Geek Squad as a service opportunities with several large companies, including Accenture, Intel, and Lenovo as we have created differentiated B2C and B2B services capability. Device lifecycle management is a specific example of the service we can provide to others and necessity for all companies, device lifecycle management refers to the process of providing tech devices like phones and laptops to employees. This is not a core competency for most companies and the recent hybridization of work has made it even more complicated. We are already supporting a number of firms as their sole device lifecycle management partner providing end-to-end support of these company-provided devices, including procurement, provisioning, deployment, repair, and end-of-life. This is just one example of our ability to leverage our data and assets and adds to the growth we're already seeing in areas like Best Buy Ads and Partner Plus. Before my closing remarks, I also want to take a moment to recognize our Geek Squad teams for their work with our communities. For more than 15 years, they have been sharing and teaching their tech expertise and skills to prepare the next generation for the future workforce. This summer, we welcomed more than 2,000 kids and teens at nearly 40 Geek Squad Academy camps across the country. These camps give participants the opportunity to learn skills on everything from coding, game design, digital music, and more. More importantly, they help young people build self-confidence, spark creativity, and discover how technology can benefit them in their educational pursuits in future careers. I am incredibly proud of all our Geek Squad agents and volunteers for their work this summer inspiring thousands of young minds through tech. As we enter the second half of the year and look forward to the holiday season, we are both proud pragmatic, and optimistic. Of course, the macro-environment remains uncertain with a number of tailwinds and headwinds soon including the October resumption of student loan payments, all of which results in uneven impacts on consumers. Overarchingly, we believe that the consumer is in a good place. But as we have said, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their household. During last conference call, we noted that we were preparing for a number of scenarios within our annual guidance range, and we believed our sales were aligning closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. We knew it would be a challenging year for the industry and we are halfway through the year and narrowing our outlook largely as expected. As Matt will discuss in more detail, we are updating our comparable sales guidance accordingly. We now expect comparable sales to decline in the range of 4.5% to 6%. This compares to our previous range of down 3% to down 6%. At the same time, we are narrowing our profitability ranges effectively raising the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for non-GAAP operating income rate and earnings per share. We continue to expect that this year will be the low point in tech demand after two years of sales declines. Tech is a bigger part of all our lives, both in our homes and in our businesses than ever, and we believe next year the consumer electronics industry should see stabilization and possibly growth driven by the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bought early in the pandemic and the normalization of tech innovation. Let me say a few words about the fourth quarter specifically. For context, we reported a comparable sales decline of 10% for fiscal '23 and roughly 8% for the first half of this year. We are guiding a Q3 year-over-year comparable sales decline that are similar to or a little better than the 6.2% decline we just reported for Q2. Our full-year guidance implies a wide range for Q4 comparable sales of down 3% to slightly positive. There are a number of factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales will improve and could potentially turn positive. We expect growth in-home theater as we expect to be better-positioned with inventory across all price points and budget spends last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our home theater business. For example, TV sales trends improved in Q2 and units returned to growth. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build-on our position of strength in the premium assortment will not exactly linear. We are also starting to see signs of stabilization in this category as Q2 laptop sales trends improved materially and units were flat to last year. We expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there is a promising slate of new software titles expected to be released in the back half of the year. We are planning for potential growth in the mobile phone category as we expect inventory to be less constrained than last year and expect to drive growth in our unlocked phones business. Our hypothesis regarding the holiday season is that the consumer largely returns to pre-pandemic behavior. By this, we mean that they will be looking for great deals and convenience and traffic will be weighted toward promotional events. We have an excellent team and strong omnichannel assets that thrive in such an environment. In summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continue to drive volatility as we move through the year, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve and we remain incredibly excited about our future opportunities. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access, and of course generative AI where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement. As the largest CE specialty retailer with one-third of the U.S. computing and television market share, we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else can. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for some more details on our second quarter results and our fiscal '24 outlook. Yes, maybe in this, we were talking about computing specifically, and maybe I'll give just a little bit more color there. I mean I think what we're seeing broadly is that computing innovations and the refresh cycles are getting shorter and they are accelerating and we continue to see people using all of their devices more often and far more like a computing processing intensive. And these are really specific activities and you can see both whether you're using it at home, and you're seeing a lot more streaming, or whether using it at work and you're starting to want to leverage some of these more advanced technologies. Obviously, like, for example, Microsoft pre-pandemic focused on dual screen and that was kind of something we had talked about for a while, but they quickly pivoted some of their developments within their Windows OS to address consumer productivity where all of us, we're kind of struggling to make sure we're as productive as possible on multiple devices, a lot of that enhancement went into productivity and I think the emergence of AI is at the heart of many of these innovations. I think in this case, in this example, it centers around the Windows copilot on Windows 11, which brings ChatGPT and AI innovations in the cloud applications within that Windows Office Suite within PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel. And I think what we're expecting will happen and I alluded to it on the call is obviously you're going to have likely at some points here different generation of technology that's going to have more intensively leverage the capabilities that are necessary to run these AI models. I think that's one example. We talk about this often, Scot. It's hard for us always to know exactly what that new horizon of technology is going to be, but this is one that probably has some of the broadest implications for all of our collective productivity. Thank you. And, Greg, just to make sure we're clear that 100 basis points as versus FY '20. So that's more than like structural change that we've seen over the last four-ish years. Thank you. Yes, right now as it relates specifically to the card, we aren't seeing massive change in credit availability. We're continuing to see and we've said before, about 25% of our business is done on the card. We're continuing to see those trends. And what are the nice things about our card is as I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I want to emphasize that you can either choose points or you can choose 0% financing and so it's actually it's an offering that is widely accepted and appreciated, especially against the backdrop so the consumer can decide what's more relevant for them. So like Matt said, we're seeing more of a normalization in some of those key metrics. But in general, it remains an incredibly efficient asset for us in partnership, obviously in the profit share structure that we have. Yes. Well, on the entertainment side of things, that really is reflective of gaming and particularly gaming hardware, which had a much more stable supply this year than what we saw last year, so, we feel like that's a nice indicator as we're heading into the back half of the year. We mentioned that. And on the services side, that really is mainly reflective of our membership offering and now starting to kind of annualize that higher, larger cohorts of members. Thank you. So, question one, overall vendor trading up for now. We're not going to say total amounts of vendor funding, but you can imagine, at any given point in time our vendors like us are trying to think in a very omnichannel way how best can we both stimulate demand and complete excellent customer experiences. When we kind of like look all in at everything our vendors do with us, we feel confident that we have at least as much if not more like total funding in partnership with our vendors, but of course they're going to use different pockets depending on the environment that we fit in. I think on your profit pool question, Michael, what's interesting is our vendors and we've said this for a long time. Our vendors are as interested as we are in stimulating consumer demand. Sometimes that means they lean highly into innovation and trying to drive replacement cycles and trying to drive that incremental demand through innovation. Sometimes that means we partner closely together in how we show up in stores, whether that's physically or in labor, and then sometimes that means, we will partner together in highly promotional or value-oriented periods to make sure, collectively, we are putting our best foot forward and it goes back to some of what I ended my comments with. There is a larger installed base of consumer electronics out there. And this is not static equipment we all have. This is equipment that whether or not you want to upgrade it, sometimes just wears out and breaks. And this is our unique place in this consumer electronics industry. In partnership with our vendors, we are arguably the best to commercializing that new technology or bringing kind of this total story agnostic just carrying about the customer to life and I think what you're seeing is this in this period right now, our ability to help drive value in partnership with our customers is really highlighted. Thank you. I think what's most important is that at any given point in time, what the team I would argue has done a magnificent job doing is balancing acquisition, retention, and engagement. And while to Matt's point, cost to serve as part of our considerations. What we want are not just to acquire a bunch of members but to make sure they are incredibly engaged and to make sure we retain them over time. And so while the profitability impact is part of what we're looking at, the bigger question we are actually looking at is, what is that combination of acquisition, retention, and engagement that drives what we talked about, which is more sticky customers that bring a larger share of wallet and help keep Best Buy relevant over time. So the good news is, overall, we feel very strongly about our position in the industry and we talked about it already a bit. We are confident in our relationship with our vendors and grateful for their partnership and I think we continue to be excited to keep investing in our strategy from a position of strength. We've said before, there is not a great single source for market share, both because we have a large portfolio of services. Also because we are always evolving new categories, but from what we can see in some of the more established categories, we have at least held our share in Q2 and we believe that's been true really the first half of the year. So no major trajectory change. We feel like we're positioned well and obviously, the team will continue to work with our vendor partners and ensure that we have that great valuable assortment for our customers. Brad, explicitly I want to highlight. We started talking about this category becoming promotional again in the fall of 2021. And so this is a category very different than some of what you're hearing and I'll just use an example like a number, where you're starting to see that pullback. That is not the case here, but structurally, we have seen ASPs increase. So to your point about this is generally seen as a deflationary category. We spent some time talking on the last call about the fact that actually over time, it is not necessarily deflationary because every single new Rev of products carries with it a new and different price tag. So actually, over the longer period, when we look back to FY '20, we have seen structural increases in ASP, but that is due more to our premium mix and it's do more to having got more high ASP products like appliances and home theater. And so, I just want to make sure I'm explicit in saying this is a bit of a different category on the pricing side of things. Matt did an exceptional job on some of the costing side of things, but we're in a different place than many other industries and categories. Yes. I will start with our number one priority is and always has been the safety of our customers and our employees. And I need to be clear that in certain parts of the country in certain stores do that attempt that whether it's breaking in or whether it's larger-scale just grabbing and running out that those are real and we are definitely seeing an increase. However, we did not call-out material impacts to the business as a result of shrink pressure. And as we think about the way we think about shrink is overarching everything we call shrink as a percent of revenue, right, because you're kind of trying to gauge it versus the volume and in total, our shrink as a percent of our revenue is within 10 basis-points of pre pandemic fiscal '20 now, I give our teams all the credit in the world around us, and one of the things that's a little bit different here at Best Buy is given the high-ticket nature of what we sell, we've been addressing shrink aggressively for honestly many-many years. It's really embedded in the culture and think about some of the things that are different for us, we have front door asset protection in our stores and likely often more floor coverage as well because we just have more employees in our stores and they just do an exceptional job of washing out over our stores, we usually just have one entrants in our stores, we tend to have less self-checkout. We have a very-high digital penetration at 33%, so that's a little bit different. We also have to spend a lot of time on online side, which is a different kind of definition upstream. And so we just have structurally. I think a little bit different and honestly have been investing really heavily in this space over-time. I'm trying to really hard in our buildings, protect our employees and assets. And then as I mentioned, now going into the next realm of technology solutions that are trying to protect the customer experience and make it still seamless for the customer to get everything they want, and at the same time, create the safest possible environment. Good morning. Yes. I'm going to talk from a consumer engagement lens. The thesis of membership has been consistent since the beginning is to drive customer engagement and increase share of wallet in consumer electronics, that is the end game that we're trying to accomplish, all the more important in an environment where we have plenty of data that says consumers are a little less brand loyal than they've ever been, and so it becomes even more important for us to both create and then maintain this deep relationship with our customers. What we've learned across and I said it before, but ahead again across acquisition, retention, and engagement, what we've learned is different customers value and different cohorts of customers value different qualities in our membership program. And so that's why the tiers of Free, Plus and Total they will appeal to either in the free case, someone who just really wants the convenience of free shipping on everything. On the Total - or on the Plus aspect, excuse me, that's someone who loves convenience and a great value, right, they're going to get the promotions. They're going to get early access and we get 60-day return windows. And then on the total. I want all of that plus. I really value the support aspect of what we deal and the most important output of all of those at the end-of-the-day is that we can see customers who both stay engaged with us and we can see that repeat business, and we can see that increase in share of wallet meeting every time they think about making a purchase in consumer electronics, they just come to us because it's so easy why do you go anywhere else. So that structurally, is what you're trying to build to. Over time, you both want the program itself to be efficient, you wanted to be a reasonable cost of acquisition, but over time, you also want a customer who is shopping with more frequency and ultimately spending more with Best Buy. You bet. Thank you, Brian. We appreciate the questions and overarchingly thank you to everyone who took the time to be with us today. And before we close the call. I want to make sure we acknowledge the wildfires in Maui, but also the wildfires, we've seen in Canada. And those bracing for a hurricane in Florida. Our hearts genuinely go out to those impacted and we are doing all we can to support our employees in all of those impacted areas. Thank you so much for joining us today."

I will now turn the call over to Corie.\nCorie Barry: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting Q1 sales results that are right in line with the expectations we shared in March and profitability that was better than expected, demonstrating our strong operational execution. We are appropriately balancing the need to adjust in response to the current industry sales trends with the need to invest, so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to growth. In this environment, customers are clearly feeling cautious and making trade-off decisions as they continue to deal with high inflation and low consumer confidence due to a number of factors. At the same time, in Q1, we saw our purchasing customer behavior remain relatively consistent in terms of demographics, and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. In addition, our focus on being there for our customers with expertise and support was highlighted by material improvements and satisfaction scores for our in-home services and delivery and record scores in remote support, in-home repairs, store care, and Best Buy Totaltech call center experiences, all key differentiators for us. We remain as confident as ever about our strong position in the industry despite reporting lower sales than last year. In Q1, our comparable sales were down 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. From a merchandising perspective, similar to the past few quarters, the largest impacts to our Domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, and appliances. The promotional environment played out largely as expected. It was slightly more promotional than last year, and we believe we are now fully normalized to pre-pandemic levels from both the percent of products being promoted and the depths of promotions. In some products and categories, the environment was more promotional than we had expected, and we saw promotional levels above fiscal '20. We effectively managed through those situations in partnership with our vendors. On a blended basis, our overall average selling price, or ASP, was slightly down to last year due to the return of promotionality. While we're on the topic, I would like to take a step back and address what we believe is a common misperception about our industry, that all products we sell are perpetually deflationary. In fact, most of our categories have had price stability over time or even seen increases. The price of a product may come down in the year after it launches only to be replaced by the next generation of the product launched at the same or slightly higher price. Innovation drives price stability and often drives consumers to adopt even higher ASP products based on new technology or additional features. For example, the five-year compounded annual growth rate for average laptop prices is approximately 2%. For Best Buy specifically, we over index in the newest innovation and next generation of products, so we tend to carry a higher ASP than the overall industry. Additionally, as a reminder, structurally, our overall ASPs have also increased over the last several years due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs, as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points. Now back to our Q1 results. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 17% compared to last year as we lapped last year's elevated levels. The team continues to manage inventory tightly, targeting approximately 60 forward days of supply. We expect that our inventory levels will continue to normalize and year-over-year variances will more closely match our sales performance as we move through the year. In the first quarter, digital sales comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, very similar to the last two years, and twice as high as pre-pandemic. Our \" Buy Online, Pickup In Store\" percent of sales was also very consistent, at just over 40%. Considering the speed of our delivery, with almost 60% of packages delivered within two days, we believe the consistency of our high in-store pickup by our customers really underscores the importance and convenience of our stores. I continue to be proud of our team's execution and ability to navigate through this challenging environment, always keeping our customers and their experience as our top priority. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect the macro environment to continue to pressure demand in our industry this year. However, our guide for the year implies that we expect year-over-year comp performance to improve as we move through the year and we lap the comparable sales declines we experienced last year. Based on what we can see right now, we continue to believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. Matt will provide more color on our expectations later in the call. This year, we are focused on delivering great customer experiences while running the business efficiently and strategically setting ourselves up to flourish when the industry returns to growth. This includes our efforts to expand our gross profit rate, and to continue to prudently manage our SG&A expense. Now, I'd like to update you on our membership program. The goal of membership is to drive increased customer engagement and increased share of wallet over time. As it relates to our paid membership program, our investment thesis remains very much intact. Our members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy, and buying more across categories than non-members. Additionally, members rate our experiences higher. Our net promoter scores from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than from non-members. No membership program is static, and we have always stated that it was our intent to iterate over time as we learned more. We've learned a tremendous amount from our members over the last couple of years, particularly that different customers value very different benefits when it comes to their technology. Earlier this month, we announced changes to our membership program that align all our memberships, and will give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget, and lifestyle. In addition, these changes will provide more flexibility and result in a lower cost to serve than our existing Totaltech program. Starting June 27, our membership program will offer three tiers: My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. I'll spend a few minutes going a little deeper on each of the tiers. My Best Buy will remain our free tier plan built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account, like online access to purchase history, order tracking, and fast checkout. As you may recall, My Best Buy had historically been a points-based loyalty program. This past February, we added the free shipping benefit. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit card. The customer and financial impacts we have seen thus far validate our decision. For example, the online conversion rate for products under $35 has increased, and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the early financial impact has been better than we modeled. My Best Buy Plus is a new membership plan built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get everything included with the My Best Buy offering as well as exclusive prices and access to highly-anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60 day return and exchange window on most products. My Best Buy Total is a membership plan built for customers who want protection and support. This tier is an evolution of our current Totaltech offer and is $20 cheaper at $179.99 per year. It includes all the benefits from the Plus tier, as well as Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone, or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchased them. It also continues to include up to two years of product protection, including AppleCare+ on most new Best Buy purchases. Instead of free in-home installation and haul-away services, members will receive promotional offers from time to time. As we reflected on the goals of our membership programs, we made this change because we could see that many customers who became members primarily for free installation services did not stay with the program as long as other members, and had significantly higher churn. From a financial perspective, we continue to expect our membership program to contribute approximately 25 basis points of Enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion in fiscal '24. We have already begun to deliver on this expectation as the changes we made to the free My Best Buy tier benefited our gross margin rate this quarter. Now, I will shift topics to talk about our omnichannel operations. We are continuing to adapt our omnichannel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. For example, our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multi-channel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 store plans we announced this past March. These include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing eight Experience Store remodels, and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. Consistent with the plans we shared entering the year and incorporated in our fiscal '24 guidance, during Q1, we advanced our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our business model and current trends. As I mentioned on our last call, over the past three years, our overall headcount has declined by approximately 25,000 people or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility. As a reminder, the vast majority of this headcount change came through the pandemic from attrition and our decisions not to backfill. Throughout these significant changes, we have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our employees, customers, and shareholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. We also know that not all roles and the associated hourly pay are the same, and strategic trade-off decisions are necessary to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately, particularly customer-facing labor. Based on all these factors, we have been, as we'd previously said, making multiple changes to our labor models. One such example is the recent change to our consultation program. By lowering the overall number of in-store consultants and designers, we were able to add approximately 2 million more hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year. Customers are already giving us higher marks for improved associate availability in recent customer surveys. It's also important to note that we are moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to our stores and staffing to a market-based approach. And depending on the needs of each market, we're adding, removing, shifting, or arranging the number of associates and roles needed to better and more efficiently serve those customers and to allow for more localized flexibility. Looking forward, we will continue to iterate our model to align with business trends, including initiatives such as membership and ensuring the span of control of our leaders is appropriate. As you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels that also deliver efficiencies and better margins. I'd like to share a few examples around our customer care phone experience and our in-home sales team. Our customer care agents receive millions of customer phone calls every year. We recently launched a capability that uses generative AI to summarize the main points and follow ups from each call. In the past, customer care agents manually took note to capture interactions real time with customers. This new capability allows our agents to both fully focus on the customer during the call and reduces time between calls, lowering overall cost and improving agent satisfaction. In addition, this is providing us with valuable information about friction in our experiences, allowing us to continuously drive upstream improvements. In another example, we're piloting a virtual reality training and simulation experience for our in-home consultants and designers. We expect this will decrease the cost to develop and certify in-home sales teams, and elevate the specialized in-home selling skills of consultants and designers, especially those who are newer and less experienced. Additionally, these tools are always available for reference whether a team member is in a customer's home or training in a store. Now, I will take a few moments to share our thoughts on our broader industry backdrop. As I mentioned, we expect that next year, the consumer electronics industry will see stabilization and possibly growth, following two down years. I believe it's worth repeating why we are confident our industry will return to growth. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger install base of technology products in consumers' homes. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in just 2019. Second, we expect to begin to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought early in the pandemic possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every three to seven years, depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle, and home theater and large appliances toward the higher end of that range. We continue to see our lapsed customers returning at higher rates year-over-year, especially as customers we acquired early in the pandemic return for additional technology purchases. Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spent by some of the world's largest companies, and likely some we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant over the long term, driving interest, upgrades, and experimentation. We can see the customer demand for newness exemplified in the last few weeks by the record-breaking launch of the new Zelda software for Nintendo Switch and the stronger-than-expected pre-orders for the new ASUS' handheld gaming device. We continue to believe the industry will get back to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation toward the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, generative AI, and expansion of broadband access. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. We are also furthering our expansion into newer categories, like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living, and electric car charging. We carry multiple EV charging brands, and we were the first retailer to carry Tesla chargers. We also launched Starlink's satellite Internet kits on our digital channels and we'll have it available in stores later this summer. In addition, we are partnering with our vendors in new ways that leverage our capabilities to create new opportunities. For example, we are partnering with Roku to make TV advertising more relevant and performance driven. The first-ever TVs to be designed and made by Roku are available exclusively at our stores and on bestbuy.com. And brands will be able to work with us to target, optimize, and measure their ads on Roku using Best Buy audience data. We also continue to build our Partner+ program that leverages our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities. We have several vendor partners, including Samsung, who are offering their online customers the option to conveniently pick up their products at their local Best Buy store. The recent launch of Oura smart rings is an example of how we partner with some of our smaller emerging vendors in a very comprehensive and unique way to drive customer engagement. Oura is a smart ring that uses sensors to track a variety of metrics to provide continuous health monitoring to improve the user's health habits. We launched the products exclusively on bestbuy.com and in 850 stores. We have an interactive demo experience with the ability to try on the rings and order any configuration of style, color, and size. We also incorporated the Best Buy store finder on Oura's website, so customers can visit their closest store and see the products in person. I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation for all our associates across the company, who continue to uniquely position us for the future through immense change. We continue to focus on providing competitive pay and benefits and leveraging flexible work models. And I am pleased to report that we maintain industry low turnover rates, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. It's amazing to see so many of our key leaders choosing to build the future of retail with us. And I am proud of the many ways we were recognized during the quarter for our commitment to our people and the environment. We were included on DiversityInc's 2023 list of Top 50 Companies for Diversity and ranked 17th on DiversityInc's Top Companies for Board of Directors list, reflecting our ongoing work to ensure our leaders and our company reflect the communities we serve. Just last week, we were listed on Parity.Org's list of Best Companies for Women to Advance, as well as their inaugural Best Companies for People of Color to Advance. We were one of fewer than 20 companies named to both lists this year. We were also recently named one of Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies for the sixth year in a row. In fact, this year, we were the top-ranked retailer. My summary is consistent with my comments last quarter. We believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with a focus on our strategic initiatives and future. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our first quarter financial and fiscal '24 outlook.\nMatt Bilunas: Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our first quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.5 billion declined 10.1% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% declined 120 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A was $40 million lower than last year and increased approximately 180 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 60 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.15 decreased 27%. While our revenue was down to last year, overall our results once again aligned closely with our expectations entering the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to both higher gross profit rate and lower SG&A. The better-than-expected gross profit rate included favorable supply chain costs and benefits associated with changes made last year to our free My Best Buy membership offering. The favorable SG&A was driven by a combination of several smaller items with store payroll expense being the largest driver. Next, I will walk through the details on our first quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 11% to $8.8 billion, driven by comparable sales decline of 10.4%. From a phasing perspective, February was our best-performing month on a year-over-year basis with trends softening through the remainder of the quarter. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing, appliances, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in our gaming and service categories. In our International segment, revenue decreased 11.6% to $666 million. This decrease was driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and a comparable sales decline of 5.5% in Canada. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 22.6%. The higher gross profit rate included the following: First, improvement from our membership offerings. This included a higher gross profit rate in our services category, which was primarily driven by the cumulative growth in Totaltech members. In addition, our rate benefited from the program changes we made last year to our free My Best Buy offering. Second, product margin rates improved versus last year despite increased promotional activity. And third, the profit sharing revenue from our private label credit card arrangement was a benefit to our Domestic gross profit rate. Overall, the results this quarter aligned with our commitment to improve our gross profit rate this year. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate of 23.7% decreased 60 basis points compared to last year, which added approximately 10 basis points of pressure to our Enterprise results on a weighted basis. The lower International gross profit rate was primarily driven by a lower mix of revenue from the higher margin rate services category. Before moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which we have now called out as a benefit to our gross profit rate for the last eight quarters. In fiscal '23, the profit share was approximately 1.4% of Domestic revenue, an increase of 50 basis points compared to fiscal '20. The growth was driven by the increased usage of our card, both at and outside of Best Buy and the favorable credit environment. Our outlook for fiscal '24 assumes the profit share will have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on our gross profit rate for the remainder of the year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $29 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll cost and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and depreciation. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a little more than $1 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 17% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During the quarter, we returned a total of $281 million to shareholders through dividends of $202 million and share repurchases of $79 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.92 was an increase of 5% and marked the 10th straight year of dividend increases. We expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24; however, we are not providing a target. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress through the year. Moving next to capital expenditures, where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of approximately $80 million compared to last year with lower store related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend. Now, we'd like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As a reminder, our original guide for this year assumes the consumer electronics industry would continue to feel the pressure of the broader macro environment and the high degree of uncertainty as it relates to the consumer. Our financial performance in the first quarter closely aligned with our expectations and we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided this past March. Given the current environment, we are, of course, preparing for a number of scenarios within our guidance range. At this point, we believe our sales align closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. It is still early in the year, so we will continue to watch the trends closely and adjust as necessary. Let me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions. Starting with revenue. We expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion and Enterprise comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect the 53rd week to add approximately $700 million of revenue and it is excluded from our comparable sales. Our guide implies comparable sales trends versus last year improve as we progress through the year. Let me share context on that. Starting in Q1 of last year, our industry experienced the beginnings of macro pressure and the broader implications of normalizing consumer demand trends after two years of higher growth. This resulted in a 10% comparable sales decline for the full year. For the remainder of this year, we will continue to lap the industry pressure that only worsened from the first quarter of last year. Furthermore, when using fiscal '20 as a comparison, you will see that our guidance implies revenue trends will further soften in the second quarter. After removing the estimated revenue from the 53rd week, the midpoint of our revenue guidance reflects a scenario where our growth compared to fiscal '20 is slightly negative in the second quarter and regresses slightly more in the second half of this year. This is clearly a continued slowdown in revenue growth compared to fiscal '20. For reference, our revenue growth compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20 peaked at 27% in Q1 of fiscal '22 and generally has been slowing ever since the last quarter at 4%. Moving on to full year profitability guidance, which is, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and for interest income to exceed interest expense this year. As it relates to the extra week, we expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. I will review the full year gross profit rate and SG&A working assumptions that we shared this past March. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 basis points to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives: we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment, and our omnichannel operations; we also expect our membership program and our health initiative to improve our gross profit rate; lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs, and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year. Now, moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million and store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect that comparable sales will decline in the range of 6% to 8%, which reflects a sequential year-over-year improvement compared to the first quarter. Our revenue growth trends during the first three weeks of the quarter improved from April and were within our Q2 guidance range. On the profitability side, we anticipate our second quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3% or slightly higher. Lastly, we expect SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year at the midpoint of our revenue range. I will now turn the call over to the operator for question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, good morning, and nice job navigating in this backdrop. My question -- my one question is on industry growth, this idea that maybe we bottomed this year. If you look at the category, it's more than reverted to your point, Matt, around sales trends. It looks like it's overshot in a way. And you could have made the case that this year '23 could have -- should have been sort of the bottom and even the turn. So, what gives you confidence in '24? Because once you overshoot, it's hard to determine where that bottom is. Curious if you can provide some more color.\nCorie Barry: Yes. Thank you, Simeon. Let me start with a little bit of the backdrop here. And I think we've been pretty consistent in saying -- we started really in Q2 of last year in saying the consumer is clearly making trade-off decisions in a very unique environment. So, to your kind of original question on the reversion, I think what we would say is we've been seeing a consumer who is, whether or not you call it a recession, exhibiting some recessionary behaviors depending on the different category that you're talking about. So, it's absolutely unusual. I think as we look ahead, we start to feel like you see the turn in the business as you head out the back half of this year and into next year. And there are a few industry sources that we're using to help substantiate that. If you look at NPD, CTA, Forrester, a lot of those have the same kind of points of view. So first of all, we're just looking externally to say, what do we see in the landscape. But I think we tried to lay out, even within the prepared remarks, there are some key tenets here that we believe underscore our thoughts for next year. One is, this idea of truly a larger install base. Yes, absolutely, there was some pull-forward in the pandemic, but some of that had to be incremental given you now have two times as many connected devices in people's homes as you had versus just 2019. So, you absolutely have this larger install base of product. And these are not static products. These are products that we can already see our vendors working to upgrade and innovate and drive. The second point that we made, which is replacement cycles. Natural replacement cycle is three to seven years. Like we said, quicker on the mobile side, computing in the middle, appliances and TVs more on the high end. But these are pretty consistent replacement cycles that we see over time. If anything, we saw them maybe accelerate a bit during the pandemic, normalize a bit more now. But on the whole, you've got products that because of their nature, you're going to want to upgrade. And then, the third is the pace of vendor innovation. And you can -- that's why we gave some specific examples in the prepared remarks. You can already start to see some of that innovation coming. I think the window that we have into our vendors would say it's more towards the back half of this year and into next year. I think we were clear in the prepared remarks to say, this is all based on what we can see now, and we're going to continue to evaluate. But as of right now, it feels like that consumers kind of made their choices about the industry that we're in, and we still feel really well set up as we start to head into the next calendar year.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nJoe Feldman: Great. Thanks guys for taking the questions. I have a couple of quick follow-ups for you. With regard to the incentive comp for this year, can you help us out why it would go up as much as it is given it's such a challenging year? Not that you guys shouldn't get paid, but I just wanted to better understand it.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, sure. First, I'll take you back to last year. Last year, we had about $455 million of favorability in incentive compensation. As you think about last year, by the end of last year, we had essentially not paid out any of our incentive comp based on our annual performance last year, a lot of which is driven by revenue and operating income expectations as you enter the year. And so, essentially we've reversed out all of that expense last year. And so, as you set new targets for this year FY '24, you reset your tables and expectations for sales and operating performance. And so, essentially just getting back from essentially almost a zero payout to a 1.0 payout, we've added over -- about $225 million of expense at the top end of our guidance, just simply reflect like a normal payout for this year because it's really more of a year-over-year impact of not paying out anything and then maybe starting the year with the expectation that we would pay out at a more normal midpoint.\nJoe Feldman: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for explaining. And then, a quick follow-up on the promotional side of things. I think, Corie, you had mentioned that there were some categories that were a little more promotional than expected. I was kind of curious as to what those were. And the sort of second part of promotions, are people responding when promotions do kick in?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I think, I'll start and Corie can jump in. There are a few categories that we saw a heightened level of promotionality, appliances is one of them, computing was one of them, headphones was another. There's a number that more promotional year-over-year and in some cases, even more promotional than they were pre-pandemic. And like any year, that's not just us who are incented to drive sales. Our vendors are incented to drive sales as well. And the outcome of that actually didn't lead to strengthen our product margins in totality. So the more heightened promotionality didn't necessarily manifest in profitability pressure on a year-over-year basis, but there were a number of categories that people are trying to stimulate and drive sales because of the environment we're in.\nCorie Barry: From an elasticity perspective, Joe, I hate always feeling like I answer this way, it depends on the category a little bit. I think, to Matt's point about appliances, that definitely right now is a category that is a little bit more reflecting a duress customer or someone who needs to replace an appliance versus the more aspirational customer. In that world, you have a little bit less elasticity, you can imagine, because you're not going to really respond to promotions as much. Some of the other parts of the business that Matt mentioned around particularly things like home theater, we're seeing response when there's more promotionality and more value. And I think, overarchingly, what I -- from a consumer perspective, this is absolutely a consumer who's looking for value and will respond to some extent, but it can depend a bit on the category that we're talking about and what their state of mind is in terms of how aspirational they want to be within that category.\nJoe Feldman: That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter.\nCorie Barry: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAnthony Chukumba: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the services business. You had a pretty strong comp increase in the Domestic business, but then in the International business, it was down. And I know part of that had to do with compares, but I was just wondering if you can just give us a little more color in terms of the divergence there. Thanks.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, sure, Anthony. The -- on the Domestic side, the services revenue growth is attributable to the growth in Totaltech members from this point to last year. And so, as we continue to sign up members, we continue to have more revenue come through that. And that's essentially the growth in the services category on the Domestic side. On the International side, we did say that there is some gross profit rate pressure on services. They're doing similar membership changes in Canada, and that's simply a reflection of timing of those membership changes they made last year. This year, they start to cycle those changes they made earlier in their year after this Q1. So that is a reflection of some of the membership changes that they're also making, not the same, but similar to what the Domestic side is doing.\nAnthony Chukumba: That's helpful. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thanks, Anthony.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nMike Baker: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the membership question. And so, you're making some changes, which presumably is based on driving better profitability, yet the guidance for the profitability impact this year is unchanged, maybe that's just timing because it takes time to implement these changes. But what does this do to the long-term outlook in terms of the profitability on the membership business? Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Maybe I'll start and then Matt can add. We went into the year, Mike, knowing we were going to make changes to our membership program. We have the most clarity around My Best Buy, the free program, and those changes we actually put in place at the beginning of the fiscal year. But we also had an aspiration to make changes to the other side of the program. And this just gave us a little bit of time to -- before we announce the formal changes, but we had baked the assumption that we were [going to get] (ph) these changes into the guide for the year.\nMatt Bilunas: Yes. So, very specifically, we -- last quarter and this quarter, we've said that the gross profit rate, about 40 basis points to 70 basis points of increase this year, one of those reasons is the changes to the membership program, part of which is the My Best Buy changes, as Corie mentioned, and then just expected changes on the other parts of the membership program. And to your last part of your question, we would expect to continue to iterate and update the membership financials and expect to see probably continued profit rate expansion as you look into next year. Obviously, as you -- we still have Totaltech members that still have two years of benefits, and we'll have to honor those for that two years. And then as you get into the back half of this year, we will start to see the benefit of the changes more. And then, get into next year, we would continue to iterate and have to see it more upside.\nMike Baker: Got it. Well, as someone who took advantage of the free installation, I'll miss that, but I'll take my $20 savings on the annual fee.\nCorie Barry: Well, we promised that there will still be great deals on installation. And we made clear that we're still going to pull some of those great deals. So, you will still see those coming. Also, please don't get too upset yet. And the other thing I just want to add, Mike, before you go is absolutely part of the changes result in impact to profitability. The intent of the changes was to understand customer behavior and then adjust the membership program based on the customer behavior we were seeing. So, in a world where you used to historically value points, but now things like free, reliable, fast shipping matter a lot more, you make that adjustment, not just because it has profitability impacts, but because you're actually learning about what your customers value and what accomplishes what you set out to do, which is to have more sticky customer relationships, increase that frequency and increase that share of wallet. So, we're really trying to balance both sides of the equation as we're making these decisions.\nMike Baker: Got it. Fair enough. I appreciate the color.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers, your line is open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning. Two related questions. So, you talked about the midpoint for the year on the sales side, but you didn't comment on the operating margin range. And you did just materially beat your sort of gross -- what you talked about for the gross margin in the first quarter here. So, are you expecting some give back? Any comments on that range? And then, Corie, you mentioned preparing for a number of different scenarios. I guess, what does that mean? You have cut a lot of expense out of the business on the labor side. That's your biggest cost. It's still inflationary. Where you see the opportunity to sort of protect the bottom line if comps do come in worse than expected?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, I'll start, and Corie can jump in. Thanks, Chris. The -- in terms of the EBIT midpoint, we did not comment on that. I think there's more moving pieces within the EBIT level between gross margins and SG&A levers that we can pull depending on where the sales trends go. The largest factor in that equation is going to be gross profit rate. And we're, obviously, reflecting a range of 40 basis points to 70 basis points. And so, in terms of where we land, we have a little bit more drivers or levers we can pull to kind of maneuver through that range. I think, in terms of the flow-through, we didn't flow through the Q1 OI beat. It's more a function of us giving us just a little bit of room to navigate the remainder of the year. We, obviously, have a wide range of outcomes for the year, and we want to just make sure we're being prudent with how we're making decisions as we get towards the more meaningful back half of the year.\nChris Horvers: Thanks very much.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPeter Keith: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just talk about the sales trend from the last couple of months in the context of the overall retail landscape. So, you did talk about a bit of a softening through the quarter, although I think February, of the last conference call, you were roughly down 10%. So, it didn't seem like there was too much softening. At the same time, retail has seen a significant weakness in big-ticket discretionary. You would think consumer electronics would be impacted by that. So, your sales can be down, but not falling off a cliff. Maybe comment on what you're seeing within your business versus what you think is happening more broadly at retail?\nMatt Bilunas: Sure. I can start talking about the cadence of the quarter and then Corie can jump in about broader retail. Similar to the retail industry, we did see our sales sequentially get worse as the quarter progressed. February was the best-performing month that we come in a little bit better than our -- the guidance we gave as we started the quarter, but there are a few reasons for that. I mean we gave growth number, not a comp number, so there's a bit of difference between the growth number and the comp number. We always have a few closing the book entry. So, comps in the quarter did sequentially get worse. We have, as we indicated, starting the quarter in line with the range that we gave for the first -- for the full quarter Q2, so therefore, improving from April into May in terms of comp. And so, we feel good about that range we gave for Q2 at the moment.\nCorie Barry: As it relates to the consumer, Peter, I think we've been pretty consistent since really starting in Q1 of last year, saying, we felt like, to your point exactly, in big ticket discretion and specifically in CE, given especially how much demand we saw through the pandemic, the consumer was going to make trade-off decisions. And it's a consumer that clearly, when they're faced with record high inflation versus 2020 in food, housing and fuel, that's going to drive those trade-off decisions. And I think what we've been anchored on is making sure we provide the best possible value and even altering and changing the membership program to make sure we're meeting that consumer where they are. And what we can see, I mean, we've always said, it's really hard to measure share in our business, right, because especially when it comes to services and new categories, it's very difficult. But what we believe is we're at least maintaining share in the industry. And so, to your point, it's an industry where the consumer is making decisions, but it's also an industry where everyone needs the stuff that we've got. It's not like these are just want-to-have products they're need-to-have products. And we -- especially as we look at those innovation cycles coming up, we can start to see this will stimulate a replacement and innovation cycle. So for right now, I feel really good about what we're trying to do to stay with the customer where they are given the trade-off decisions that they're making. And this industry is quite different than some of the others. And I think we've been pretty consistently trying to articulate what we're seeing in our consumers, and therefore, addressing their needs appropriately.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Well, thank you very much, and good luck.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nMatt Bilunas: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Mine is on your B2B channel or Best Buy Business. Our checks would suggest you've had some pretty big wins on this side of the enterprise as of late. Curious if you could just update us on that channel, Corie. Where is it tracking in terms of sales penetration? Is recent progress reflective of maybe any investments you've been making on that side of the business? And how are you thinking about this business performing in 2023 and beyond? Thanks so much.\nCorie Barry: I am incredibly proud of what our direct team has been able to accomplish, frankly, throughout the pandemic. And we haven't specifically released this as like a separate segment of the business or sized it, but its material and its growth, in general, has been outpacing what we've been seeing in the core. And I think it's a really creative approach to everything from education, which relies highly on technology, to hospitality, which relies heavily on technology, to even agreements with sports teams and facilities where any of us know, as you walk around, there are a ton of technology experiences that are available. We continue to believe this is an interesting growth channel for us. And we even talked last time on the call a little bit about our appliance business and starting to work with homebuilders directly in a small pilot that we're doing. So there's lots of different ways we're starting to -- and continuing. This has been a business for us for a long time. I think from an investment standpoint, I'm again very proud of the team has pivoted to even more of a digital experience. So if you go online and you're trying to buy at large quantity, we will basically move you into digitally the right channels to get you to the right people who can help you make more of those scaled purchases that you're looking for. So we're finding lots of digital ways to understand our customers, and therefore, target them more as potentially small business owners versus the kind of targeting we would do for a normal customer. And so, I like -- the team is doing a very nice job creating all the capabilities a little bit behind the scenes, frankly, in serving these business customers, and I'm proud of the growth that we've seen in that part of the business.\nJonathan Matuszewski: It's helpful. Thanks.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCorie Barry: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: So my first question, I guess, is a bit of a follow-up to some of the questions. But clearly, you managed very, very well a difficult environment here in Q1, a challenged sales quarter. In response to other questions, you said that, I think, if I heard it correctly, because it's actually deteriorated somewhat as the quarter progressed. So as you look at the business now and the performance or the activity of your consumers, what gives you the greatest confidence that this is the bottom and as we look towards '24, '25, that we'll begin -- we'll see this rebound to more normalized growth at Best Buy or within the sector?\nCorie Barry: I think when we talk about the confidence we have, I think it is both relative to the backdrop of the performance we've seen, which was a pullback in demand last year and again projecting an ongoing pullback in demand this year. So, a little bit different than some of the other industries. We started to see the change in consumer behavior much earlier than others. And as soon as, as early as last year in Q1, we talked about it, we started to see that pullback in demand. So, we're going to have now two consecutive years, as we talked about, of a consumer who's making some choices away from consumer electronics. The nature of the industry is really what gives us the most confidence, and then obviously, our very stable position within it. The nature of the industry, this is an industry where technology is necessary, necessary to live our lives every -- think about the quantity of pieces of technology you touch in any given day, and that technology is not static. If you think about how quickly both the hardware and then if you think about what I will call \"the software\" things like generative AI or like VR and AR, how much that is changing, that will all drive form, feature changes in the product, which is part of what underlies our confidence. At some point people want to -- and we know this based on lots of history through recessions, through lots of different types of industry performance, people will upgrade and want to replace their equipment and their consumer electronics. And so, I think what gives us confidence is understanding that there is a very large vendor community out there that is very interested in continuing to stimulate demand, continuing to create really cool solutions for our customers. And that, over time, I don't see a world where we rely less on technology. And so that -- it is all those underpinnings that are giving us confidence as we head out of this year and into next year. Now we said that -- and I'll repeat it, that is based on what we can see today, it's based on the environment as we understand it today. So, of course, we're going to continue to monitor and see how consumers navigate what is, obviously, a very volatile environment, but that underpinning of how different this industry is versus any others in terms of both need and constant innovation, that is the biggest part that underscores, and then obviously, our position within it and how confident we feel in our partnership with our vendors, that is what gives us the confidence as we head into next year.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful, Corie. Thank you. And then if I could just ask a quick follow-up unrelated. So, a lot of talk about membership and some of the shifts you're making there with the program. So, I guess as we step back, I mean, clearly, Best Buy, there's a revenue piece of the membership program, how do customers that are members of Best Buy, how do they perform versus non-member customers from just from an overall sales perspective?\nCorie Barry: Yes. We hit out a little bit in the prepared remarks, but they remain more engaged customers. They tend to spend more, they tend to shop across categories, they tend -- on the whole, so I'm just going to talk about this big kind of lump of members, they tend to be our most engaged customers. Now, what a couple of years of paid membership has given us though is a lot of data around what is it customers distinctly value. Because there's really three things you're trying to do with any membership program: you're trying to acquire customers, you're trying to retain customers, and you're constantly trying to engage customers. Acquisition, retention and engagement are the cornerstones of any membership program. And so, Brian, what we've been spending time on is not just who are we acquiring, but do they stay engaged with the program? Are we retaining them? And so, it's not just about kind of the full, here's what we see in our customers. They're, for sure, more engaged and they're having better experiences. But now we can start to kind of bifurcate that large customer base into different need states. And we definitely see a customer who's really oriented around value and convenience, and we definitely see a customer who's really oriented around more fulsome service and support. And this gives us the opportunity, given all the now very rich customer data we have, to start to target each of those kind of populations of customers based on a more tailored offering that we believe will resonate with them.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around store labor. You guys have made a lot of changes to the labor model over the last year or two, and you're continuing to iterate. I'd like to get a sense from you as to what you think the status is of morale within the labor force? And then secondly, whether or not the lack of the specialized roles could impact customer service levels in a negative way?\nCorie Barry: Yes, I'm going to start with the second part of the question, I'll work my way backwards. There is still very specialized labor in our stores. And we are very proud of that, and we are working very hard to make sure that we retain and continue to develop that very specialized experience over time. I think what we're trying to do is make sure that we are most effectively matching our labor, some of which is specialized, like any retailer, some of which is more kind of part-time and generalized in nature, that we are matching that specifically with how many and what type of people are coming into our stores and what it is that they need. And so, we have continued to obviously invest in wages. We were one of the first to go to a minimum $15. Our hourly wages are up more than 25% versus pre-pandemic. We're overarchingly investing hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits, and also, importantly, investing in career development and culture. And then really doing a lot of work to make sure we are bringing our employees along as we make these changes, involving them in the decisions and really trying to make sure that they feel like they also have a voice. And I think, how do we measure that? Well, one way is, obviously, we're looking at turnover, and we're pretty constantly looking at turnover. And we believe our general approach is working. Our turnover remains very low versus retail averages. It's consistent year-over-year. It is incredibly low in some of the most key areas like our general managers, where our turnover is in the mid-single digits, even given everything that RGMs have gone through in the last four years in particular. And I think that is one of the indicators. A second indicator, we continue to see a very high level of applications. Our applications have grown substantially year-over-year. So, you're seeing people want to come into the business, which is a good sign, because that means that GMs are pulling them into the business. And then third, you can imagine, we measure employee engagement. And we measure it very consistently. And not just at the high level, like here's the number. We're looking literally regionally, store-by-store, distribution center by distribution center, how engaged are our employees? And what can we do? How do we read those verbatims? How do we pull the themes? So, we are doing everything we can to create the most engaged workforce. So, it is constant work. It is not easy for our employees to go through this level of constant change, and I am incredibly proud that so many are choosing to stay with us and continue to build this culture for the future.\nSeth Basham: Great. Thank you.\nCorie Barry: Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Corie and Matt. Maybe just a high-level question on ROIC. Curious if you could update us on your various initiatives, inclusive of space allocation utilization. And then, where do you see ROIC stabilizing sort of as we work our way through this normalization period? I don't know if you could sort of reference a pre-COVID level, mid 20%s. Any thoughts on where we sort of stabilize ROIC?\nMatt Bilunas: Yes, sure. I think, at the highest level, our ROIC is impacted by the level of profitability that's flowing through that calculation. And I think where we're pointed is at continuing to make improvements in our operating model and our efficiency. As we've talked about, as we look into the next few years, we've said that we expect and want to continue to grow our operating income rate, at the same time, the industry will begin, we believe, turnaround, and we'll continue to grow in sales and our OI rate will continue to improve as we look forward or expected to. With that happening, we'll be able to drive a better profitability and that ROIC will start to climb probably back up closer to where we were, but again, that's through a combination of the industry improving, our initiatives continuing to improve and creating efficiencies and optimization through our business.\nCorie Barry: I think we have a great history, I would argue, in optimizing ROIC and making those educated bets. I would use even our store footprint as an example, things like our Experience stores, our outlets. There's a reason that we are pursuing those with vigor. And you can imagine what we're seeing in terms of return on those investments is giving us a lot of confidence into the future. There're other places where we're still testing and trying to make sure we feel like that ROIC is in line. So I think we're point to that continuing to drive that return for our investors. And with that, I think that was our last question. So thank you for joining us today. I hope that many of the investors for listening today will be able to join us for our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 14. So, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Bilunas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our first quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.5 billion declined 10.1% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% declined 120 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A was $40 million lower than last year and increased approximately 180 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 60 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.15 decreased 27%. While our revenue was down to last year, overall our results once again aligned closely with our expectations entering the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to both higher gross profit rate and lower SG&A. The better-than-expected gross profit rate included favorable supply chain costs and benefits associated with changes made last year to our free My Best Buy membership offering. The favorable SG&A was driven by a combination of several smaller items with store payroll expense being the largest driver. Next, I will walk through the details on our first quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 11% to $8.8 billion, driven by comparable sales decline of 10.4%. From a phasing perspective, February was our best-performing month on a year-over-year basis with trends softening through the remainder of the quarter. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing, appliances, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in our gaming and service categories. In our International segment, revenue decreased 11.6% to $666 million. This decrease was driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and a comparable sales decline of 5.5% in Canada. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 22.6%. The higher gross profit rate included the following: First, improvement from our membership offerings. This included a higher gross profit rate in our services category, which was primarily driven by the cumulative growth in Totaltech members. In addition, our rate benefited from the program changes we made last year to our free My Best Buy offering. Second, product margin rates improved versus last year despite increased promotional activity. And third, the profit sharing revenue from our private label credit card arrangement was a benefit to our Domestic gross profit rate. Overall, the results this quarter aligned with our commitment to improve our gross profit rate this year. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate of 23.7% decreased 60 basis points compared to last year, which added approximately 10 basis points of pressure to our Enterprise results on a weighted basis. The lower International gross profit rate was primarily driven by a lower mix of revenue from the higher margin rate services category. Before moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which we have now called out as a benefit to our gross profit rate for the last eight quarters. In fiscal '23, the profit share was approximately 1.4% of Domestic revenue, an increase of 50 basis points compared to fiscal '20. The growth was driven by the increased usage of our card, both at and outside of Best Buy and the favorable credit environment. Our outlook for fiscal '24 assumes the profit share will have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on our gross profit rate for the remainder of the year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $29 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll cost and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and depreciation. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a little more than $1 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 17% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During the quarter, we returned a total of $281 million to shareholders through dividends of $202 million and share repurchases of $79 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.92 was an increase of 5% and marked the 10th straight year of dividend increases. We expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24; however, we are not providing a target. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress through the year. Moving next to capital expenditures, where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of approximately $80 million compared to last year with lower store related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend. Now, we'd like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As a reminder, our original guide for this year assumes the consumer electronics industry would continue to feel the pressure of the broader macro environment and the high degree of uncertainty as it relates to the consumer. Our financial performance in the first quarter closely aligned with our expectations and we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided this past March. Given the current environment, we are, of course, preparing for a number of scenarios within our guidance range. At this point, we believe our sales align closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. It is still early in the year, so we will continue to watch the trends closely and adjust as necessary. Let me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions. Starting with revenue. We expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion and Enterprise comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect the 53rd week to add approximately $700 million of revenue and it is excluded from our comparable sales. Our guide implies comparable sales trends versus last year improve as we progress through the year. Let me share context on that. Starting in Q1 of last year, our industry experienced the beginnings of macro pressure and the broader implications of normalizing consumer demand trends after two years of higher growth. This resulted in a 10% comparable sales decline for the full year. For the remainder of this year, we will continue to lap the industry pressure that only worsened from the first quarter of last year. Furthermore, when using fiscal '20 as a comparison, you will see that our guidance implies revenue trends will further soften in the second quarter. After removing the estimated revenue from the 53rd week, the midpoint of our revenue guidance reflects a scenario where our growth compared to fiscal '20 is slightly negative in the second quarter and regresses slightly more in the second half of this year. This is clearly a continued slowdown in revenue growth compared to fiscal '20. For reference, our revenue growth compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20 peaked at 27% in Q1 of fiscal '22 and generally has been slowing ever since the last quarter at 4%. Moving on to full year profitability guidance, which is, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and for interest income to exceed interest expense this year. As it relates to the extra week, we expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. I will review the full year gross profit rate and SG&A working assumptions that we shared this past March. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 basis points to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives: we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment, and our omnichannel operations; we also expect our membership program and our health initiative to improve our gross profit rate; lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs, and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year. Now, moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million and store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect that comparable sales will decline in the range of 6% to 8%, which reflects a sequential year-over-year improvement compared to the first quarter. Our revenue growth trends during the first three weeks of the quarter improved from April and were within our Q2 guidance range. On the profitability side, we anticipate our second quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3% or slightly higher. Lastly, we expect SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year at the midpoint of our revenue range. I will now turn the call over to the operator for question. Yes, sure. First, I'll take you back to last year. Last year, we had about $455 million of favorability in incentive compensation. As you think about last year, by the end of last year, we had essentially not paid out any of our incentive comp based on our annual performance last year, a lot of which is driven by revenue and operating income expectations as you enter the year. And so, essentially we've reversed out all of that expense last year. And so, as you set new targets for this year FY '24, you reset your tables and expectations for sales and operating performance. And so, essentially just getting back from essentially almost a zero payout to a 1.0 payout, we've added over -- about $225 million of expense at the top end of our guidance, just simply reflect like a normal payout for this year because it's really more of a year-over-year impact of not paying out anything and then maybe starting the year with the expectation that we would pay out at a more normal midpoint. Sure. I think, I'll start and Corie can jump in. There are a few categories that we saw a heightened level of promotionality, appliances is one of them, computing was one of them, headphones was another. There's a number that more promotional year-over-year and in some cases, even more promotional than they were pre-pandemic. And like any year, that's not just us who are incented to drive sales. Our vendors are incented to drive sales as well. And the outcome of that actually didn't lead to strengthen our product margins in totality. So the more heightened promotionality didn't necessarily manifest in profitability pressure on a year-over-year basis, but there were a number of categories that people are trying to stimulate and drive sales because of the environment we're in. Yes, sure, Anthony. The -- on the Domestic side, the services revenue growth is attributable to the growth in Totaltech members from this point to last year. And so, as we continue to sign up members, we continue to have more revenue come through that. And that's essentially the growth in the services category on the Domestic side. On the International side, we did say that there is some gross profit rate pressure on services. They're doing similar membership changes in Canada, and that's simply a reflection of timing of those membership changes they made last year. This year, they start to cycle those changes they made earlier in their year after this Q1. So that is a reflection of some of the membership changes that they're also making, not the same, but similar to what the Domestic side is doing. Yes. So, very specifically, we -- last quarter and this quarter, we've said that the gross profit rate, about 40 basis points to 70 basis points of increase this year, one of those reasons is the changes to the membership program, part of which is the My Best Buy changes, as Corie mentioned, and then just expected changes on the other parts of the membership program. And to your last part of your question, we would expect to continue to iterate and update the membership financials and expect to see probably continued profit rate expansion as you look into next year. Obviously, as you -- we still have Totaltech members that still have two years of benefits, and we'll have to honor those for that two years. And then as you get into the back half of this year, we will start to see the benefit of the changes more. And then, get into next year, we would continue to iterate and have to see it more upside. Yes, I'll start, and Corie can jump in. Thanks, Chris. The -- in terms of the EBIT midpoint, we did not comment on that. I think there's more moving pieces within the EBIT level between gross margins and SG&A levers that we can pull depending on where the sales trends go. The largest factor in that equation is going to be gross profit rate. And we're, obviously, reflecting a range of 40 basis points to 70 basis points. And so, in terms of where we land, we have a little bit more drivers or levers we can pull to kind of maneuver through that range. I think, in terms of the flow-through, we didn't flow through the Q1 OI beat. It's more a function of us giving us just a little bit of room to navigate the remainder of the year. We, obviously, have a wide range of outcomes for the year, and we want to just make sure we're being prudent with how we're making decisions as we get towards the more meaningful back half of the year. Sure. I can start talking about the cadence of the quarter and then Corie can jump in about broader retail. Similar to the retail industry, we did see our sales sequentially get worse as the quarter progressed. February was the best-performing month that we come in a little bit better than our -- the guidance we gave as we started the quarter, but there are a few reasons for that. I mean we gave growth number, not a comp number, so there's a bit of difference between the growth number and the comp number. We always have a few closing the book entry. So, comps in the quarter did sequentially get worse. We have, as we indicated, starting the quarter in line with the range that we gave for the first -- for the full quarter Q2, so therefore, improving from April into May in terms of comp. And so, we feel good about that range we gave for Q2 at the moment. Thank you. Yes, sure. I think, at the highest level, our ROIC is impacted by the level of profitability that's flowing through that calculation. And I think where we're pointed is at continuing to make improvements in our operating model and our efficiency. As we've talked about, as we look into the next few years, we've said that we expect and want to continue to grow our operating income rate, at the same time, the industry will begin, we believe, turnaround, and we'll continue to grow in sales and our OI rate will continue to improve as we look forward or expected to. With that happening, we'll be able to drive a better profitability and that ROIC will start to climb probably back up closer to where we were, but again, that's through a combination of the industry improving, our initiatives continuing to improve and creating efficiencies and optimization through our business."

            "name": "Corie Barry",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting Q1 sales results that are right in line with the expectations we shared in March and profitability that was better than expected, demonstrating our strong operational execution. We are appropriately balancing the need to adjust in response to the current industry sales trends with the need to invest, so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to growth. In this environment, customers are clearly feeling cautious and making trade-off decisions as they continue to deal with high inflation and low consumer confidence due to a number of factors. At the same time, in Q1, we saw our purchasing customer behavior remain relatively consistent in terms of demographics, and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. In addition, our focus on being there for our customers with expertise and support was highlighted by material improvements and satisfaction scores for our in-home services and delivery and record scores in remote support, in-home repairs, store care, and Best Buy Totaltech call center experiences, all key differentiators for us. We remain as confident as ever about our strong position in the industry despite reporting lower sales than last year. In Q1, our comparable sales were down 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. From a merchandising perspective, similar to the past few quarters, the largest impacts to our Domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, and appliances. The promotional environment played out largely as expected. It was slightly more promotional than last year, and we believe we are now fully normalized to pre-pandemic levels from both the percent of products being promoted and the depths of promotions. In some products and categories, the environment was more promotional than we had expected, and we saw promotional levels above fiscal '20. We effectively managed through those situations in partnership with our vendors. On a blended basis, our overall average selling price, or ASP, was slightly down to last year due to the return of promotionality. While we're on the topic, I would like to take a step back and address what we believe is a common misperception about our industry, that all products we sell are perpetually deflationary. In fact, most of our categories have had price stability over time or even seen increases. The price of a product may come down in the year after it launches only to be replaced by the next generation of the product launched at the same or slightly higher price. Innovation drives price stability and often drives consumers to adopt even higher ASP products based on new technology or additional features. For example, the five-year compounded annual growth rate for average laptop prices is approximately 2%. For Best Buy specifically, we over index in the newest innovation and next generation of products, so we tend to carry a higher ASP than the overall industry. Additionally, as a reminder, structurally, our overall ASPs have also increased over the last several years due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs, as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points. Now back to our Q1 results. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 17% compared to last year as we lapped last year's elevated levels. The team continues to manage inventory tightly, targeting approximately 60 forward days of supply. We expect that our inventory levels will continue to normalize and year-over-year variances will more closely match our sales performance as we move through the year. In the first quarter, digital sales comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, very similar to the last two years, and twice as high as pre-pandemic. Our \" Buy Online, Pickup In Store\" percent of sales was also very consistent, at just over 40%. Considering the speed of our delivery, with almost 60% of packages delivered within two days, we believe the consistency of our high in-store pickup by our customers really underscores the importance and convenience of our stores. I continue to be proud of our team's execution and ability to navigate through this challenging environment, always keeping our customers and their experience as our top priority. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect the macro environment to continue to pressure demand in our industry this year. However, our guide for the year implies that we expect year-over-year comp performance to improve as we move through the year and we lap the comparable sales declines we experienced last year. Based on what we can see right now, we continue to believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. Matt will provide more color on our expectations later in the call. This year, we are focused on delivering great customer experiences while running the business efficiently and strategically setting ourselves up to flourish when the industry returns to growth. This includes our efforts to expand our gross profit rate, and to continue to prudently manage our SG&A expense. Now, I'd like to update you on our membership program. The goal of membership is to drive increased customer engagement and increased share of wallet over time. As it relates to our paid membership program, our investment thesis remains very much intact. Our members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy, and buying more across categories than non-members. Additionally, members rate our experiences higher. Our net promoter scores from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than from non-members. No membership program is static, and we have always stated that it was our intent to iterate over time as we learned more. We've learned a tremendous amount from our members over the last couple of years, particularly that different customers value very different benefits when it comes to their technology. Earlier this month, we announced changes to our membership program that align all our memberships, and will give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget, and lifestyle. In addition, these changes will provide more flexibility and result in a lower cost to serve than our existing Totaltech program. Starting June 27, our membership program will offer three tiers: My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. I'll spend a few minutes going a little deeper on each of the tiers. My Best Buy will remain our free tier plan built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account, like online access to purchase history, order tracking, and fast checkout. As you may recall, My Best Buy had historically been a points-based loyalty program. This past February, we added the free shipping benefit. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit card. The customer and financial impacts we have seen thus far validate our decision. For example, the online conversion rate for products under $35 has increased, and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the early financial impact has been better than we modeled. My Best Buy Plus is a new membership plan built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get everything included with the My Best Buy offering as well as exclusive prices and access to highly-anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60 day return and exchange window on most products. My Best Buy Total is a membership plan built for customers who want protection and support. This tier is an evolution of our current Totaltech offer and is $20 cheaper at $179.99 per year. It includes all the benefits from the Plus tier, as well as Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone, or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchased them. It also continues to include up to two years of product protection, including AppleCare+ on most new Best Buy purchases. Instead of free in-home installation and haul-away services, members will receive promotional offers from time to time. As we reflected on the goals of our membership programs, we made this change because we could see that many customers who became members primarily for free installation services did not stay with the program as long as other members, and had significantly higher churn. From a financial perspective, we continue to expect our membership program to contribute approximately 25 basis points of Enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion in fiscal '24. We have already begun to deliver on this expectation as the changes we made to the free My Best Buy tier benefited our gross margin rate this quarter. Now, I will shift topics to talk about our omnichannel operations. We are continuing to adapt our omnichannel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. For example, our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multi-channel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 store plans we announced this past March. These include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing eight Experience Store remodels, and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. Consistent with the plans we shared entering the year and incorporated in our fiscal '24 guidance, during Q1, we advanced our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our business model and current trends. As I mentioned on our last call, over the past three years, our overall headcount has declined by approximately 25,000 people or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility. As a reminder, the vast majority of this headcount change came through the pandemic from attrition and our decisions not to backfill. Throughout these significant changes, we have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our employees, customers, and shareholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. We also know that not all roles and the associated hourly pay are the same, and strategic trade-off decisions are necessary to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately, particularly customer-facing labor. Based on all these factors, we have been, as we'd previously said, making multiple changes to our labor models. One such example is the recent change to our consultation program. By lowering the overall number of in-store consultants and designers, we were able to add approximately 2 million more hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year. Customers are already giving us higher marks for improved associate availability in recent customer surveys. It's also important to note that we are moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to our stores and staffing to a market-based approach. And depending on the needs of each market, we're adding, removing, shifting, or arranging the number of associates and roles needed to better and more efficiently serve those customers and to allow for more localized flexibility. Looking forward, we will continue to iterate our model to align with business trends, including initiatives such as membership and ensuring the span of control of our leaders is appropriate. As you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels that also deliver efficiencies and better margins. I'd like to share a few examples around our customer care phone experience and our in-home sales team. Our customer care agents receive millions of customer phone calls every year. We recently launched a capability that uses generative AI to summarize the main points and follow ups from each call. In the past, customer care agents manually took note to capture interactions real time with customers. This new capability allows our agents to both fully focus on the customer during the call and reduces time between calls, lowering overall cost and improving agent satisfaction. In addition, this is providing us with valuable information about friction in our experiences, allowing us to continuously drive upstream improvements. In another example, we're piloting a virtual reality training and simulation experience for our in-home consultants and designers. We expect this will decrease the cost to develop and certify in-home sales teams, and elevate the specialized in-home selling skills of consultants and designers, especially those who are newer and less experienced. Additionally, these tools are always available for reference whether a team member is in a customer's home or training in a store. Now, I will take a few moments to share our thoughts on our broader industry backdrop. As I mentioned, we expect that next year, the consumer electronics industry will see stabilization and possibly growth, following two down years. I believe it's worth repeating why we are confident our industry will return to growth. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger install base of technology products in consumers' homes. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in just 2019. Second, we expect to begin to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought early in the pandemic possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every three to seven years, depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle, and home theater and large appliances toward the higher end of that range. We continue to see our lapsed customers returning at higher rates year-over-year, especially as customers we acquired early in the pandemic return for additional technology purchases. Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spent by some of the world's largest companies, and likely some we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant over the long term, driving interest, upgrades, and experimentation. We can see the customer demand for newness exemplified in the last few weeks by the record-breaking launch of the new Zelda software for Nintendo Switch and the stronger-than-expected pre-orders for the new ASUS' handheld gaming device. We continue to believe the industry will get back to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation toward the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, generative AI, and expansion of broadband access. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. We are also furthering our expansion into newer categories, like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living, and electric car charging. We carry multiple EV charging brands, and we were the first retailer to carry Tesla chargers. We also launched Starlink's satellite Internet kits on our digital channels and we'll have it available in stores later this summer. In addition, we are partnering with our vendors in new ways that leverage our capabilities to create new opportunities. For example, we are partnering with Roku to make TV advertising more relevant and performance driven. The first-ever TVs to be designed and made by Roku are available exclusively at our stores and on bestbuy.com. And brands will be able to work with us to target, optimize, and measure their ads on Roku using Best Buy audience data. We also continue to build our Partner+ program that leverages our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities. We have several vendor partners, including Samsung, who are offering their online customers the option to conveniently pick up their products at their local Best Buy store. The recent launch of Oura smart rings is an example of how we partner with some of our smaller emerging vendors in a very comprehensive and unique way to drive customer engagement. Oura is a smart ring that uses sensors to track a variety of metrics to provide continuous health monitoring to improve the user's health habits. We launched the products exclusively on bestbuy.com and in 850 stores. We have an interactive demo experience with the ability to try on the rings and order any configuration of style, color, and size. We also incorporated the Best Buy store finder on Oura's website, so customers can visit their closest store and see the products in person. I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation for all our associates across the company, who continue to uniquely position us for the future through immense change. We continue to focus on providing competitive pay and benefits and leveraging flexible work models. And I am pleased to report that we maintain industry low turnover rates, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. It's amazing to see so many of our key leaders choosing to build the future of retail with us. And I am proud of the many ways we were recognized during the quarter for our commitment to our people and the environment. We were included on DiversityInc's 2023 list of Top 50 Companies for Diversity and ranked 17th on DiversityInc's Top Companies for Board of Directors list, reflecting our ongoing work to ensure our leaders and our company reflect the communities we serve. Just last week, we were listed on Parity.Org's list of Best Companies for Women to Advance, as well as their inaugural Best Companies for People of Color to Advance. We were one of fewer than 20 companies named to both lists this year. We were also recently named one of Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies for the sixth year in a row. In fact, this year, we were the top-ranked retailer. My summary is consistent with my comments last quarter. We believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with a focus on our strategic initiatives and future. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our first quarter financial and fiscal '24 outlook. Yes. Thank you, Simeon. Let me start with a little bit of the backdrop here. And I think we've been pretty consistent in saying -- we started really in Q2 of last year in saying the consumer is clearly making trade-off decisions in a very unique environment. So, to your kind of original question on the reversion, I think what we would say is we've been seeing a consumer who is, whether or not you call it a recession, exhibiting some recessionary behaviors depending on the different category that you're talking about. So, it's absolutely unusual. I think as we look ahead, we start to feel like you see the turn in the business as you head out the back half of this year and into next year. And there are a few industry sources that we're using to help substantiate that. If you look at NPD, CTA, Forrester, a lot of those have the same kind of points of view. So first of all, we're just looking externally to say, what do we see in the landscape. But I think we tried to lay out, even within the prepared remarks, there are some key tenets here that we believe underscore our thoughts for next year. One is, this idea of truly a larger install base. Yes, absolutely, there was some pull-forward in the pandemic, but some of that had to be incremental given you now have two times as many connected devices in people's homes as you had versus just 2019. So, you absolutely have this larger install base of product. And these are not static products. These are products that we can already see our vendors working to upgrade and innovate and drive. The second point that we made, which is replacement cycles. Natural replacement cycle is three to seven years. Like we said, quicker on the mobile side, computing in the middle, appliances and TVs more on the high end. But these are pretty consistent replacement cycles that we see over time. If anything, we saw them maybe accelerate a bit during the pandemic, normalize a bit more now. But on the whole, you've got products that because of their nature, you're going to want to upgrade. And then, the third is the pace of vendor innovation. And you can -- that's why we gave some specific examples in the prepared remarks. You can already start to see some of that innovation coming. I think the window that we have into our vendors would say it's more towards the back half of this year and into next year. I think we were clear in the prepared remarks to say, this is all based on what we can see now, and we're going to continue to evaluate. But as of right now, it feels like that consumers kind of made their choices about the industry that we're in, and we still feel really well set up as we start to head into the next calendar year. From an elasticity perspective, Joe, I hate always feeling like I answer this way, it depends on the category a little bit. I think, to Matt's point about appliances, that definitely right now is a category that is a little bit more reflecting a duress customer or someone who needs to replace an appliance versus the more aspirational customer. In that world, you have a little bit less elasticity, you can imagine, because you're not going to really respond to promotions as much. Some of the other parts of the business that Matt mentioned around particularly things like home theater, we're seeing response when there's more promotionality and more value. And I think, overarchingly, what I -- from a consumer perspective, this is absolutely a consumer who's looking for value and will respond to some extent, but it can depend a bit on the category that we're talking about and what their state of mind is in terms of how aspirational they want to be within that category. Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Anthony. Maybe I'll start and then Matt can add. We went into the year, Mike, knowing we were going to make changes to our membership program. We have the most clarity around My Best Buy, the free program, and those changes we actually put in place at the beginning of the fiscal year. But we also had an aspiration to make changes to the other side of the program. And this just gave us a little bit of time to -- before we announce the formal changes, but we had baked the assumption that we were [going to get] (ph) these changes into the guide for the year. Well, we promised that there will still be great deals on installation. And we made clear that we're still going to pull some of those great deals. So, you will still see those coming. Also, please don't get too upset yet. And the other thing I just want to add, Mike, before you go is absolutely part of the changes result in impact to profitability. The intent of the changes was to understand customer behavior and then adjust the membership program based on the customer behavior we were seeing. So, in a world where you used to historically value points, but now things like free, reliable, fast shipping matter a lot more, you make that adjustment, not just because it has profitability impacts, but because you're actually learning about what your customers value and what accomplishes what you set out to do, which is to have more sticky customer relationships, increase that frequency and increase that share of wallet. So, we're really trying to balance both sides of the equation as we're making these decisions. Thank you. Thank you. As it relates to the consumer, Peter, I think we've been pretty consistent since really starting in Q1 of last year, saying, we felt like, to your point exactly, in big ticket discretion and specifically in CE, given especially how much demand we saw through the pandemic, the consumer was going to make trade-off decisions. And it's a consumer that clearly, when they're faced with record high inflation versus 2020 in food, housing and fuel, that's going to drive those trade-off decisions. And I think what we've been anchored on is making sure we provide the best possible value and even altering and changing the membership program to make sure we're meeting that consumer where they are. And what we can see, I mean, we've always said, it's really hard to measure share in our business, right, because especially when it comes to services and new categories, it's very difficult. But what we believe is we're at least maintaining share in the industry. And so, to your point, it's an industry where the consumer is making decisions, but it's also an industry where everyone needs the stuff that we've got. It's not like these are just want-to-have products they're need-to-have products. And we -- especially as we look at those innovation cycles coming up, we can start to see this will stimulate a replacement and innovation cycle. So for right now, I feel really good about what we're trying to do to stay with the customer where they are given the trade-off decisions that they're making. And this industry is quite different than some of the others. And I think we've been pretty consistently trying to articulate what we're seeing in our consumers, and therefore, addressing their needs appropriately. Thank you. I am incredibly proud of what our direct team has been able to accomplish, frankly, throughout the pandemic. And we haven't specifically released this as like a separate segment of the business or sized it, but its material and its growth, in general, has been outpacing what we've been seeing in the core. And I think it's a really creative approach to everything from education, which relies highly on technology, to hospitality, which relies heavily on technology, to even agreements with sports teams and facilities where any of us know, as you walk around, there are a ton of technology experiences that are available. We continue to believe this is an interesting growth channel for us. And we even talked last time on the call a little bit about our appliance business and starting to work with homebuilders directly in a small pilot that we're doing. So there's lots of different ways we're starting to -- and continuing. This has been a business for us for a long time. I think from an investment standpoint, I'm again very proud of the team has pivoted to even more of a digital experience. So if you go online and you're trying to buy at large quantity, we will basically move you into digitally the right channels to get you to the right people who can help you make more of those scaled purchases that you're looking for. So we're finding lots of digital ways to understand our customers, and therefore, target them more as potentially small business owners versus the kind of targeting we would do for a normal customer. And so, I like -- the team is doing a very nice job creating all the capabilities a little bit behind the scenes, frankly, in serving these business customers, and I'm proud of the growth that we've seen in that part of the business. Thank you. Good morning. I think when we talk about the confidence we have, I think it is both relative to the backdrop of the performance we've seen, which was a pullback in demand last year and again projecting an ongoing pullback in demand this year. So, a little bit different than some of the other industries. We started to see the change in consumer behavior much earlier than others. And as soon as, as early as last year in Q1, we talked about it, we started to see that pullback in demand. So, we're going to have now two consecutive years, as we talked about, of a consumer who's making some choices away from consumer electronics. The nature of the industry is really what gives us the most confidence, and then obviously, our very stable position within it. The nature of the industry, this is an industry where technology is necessary, necessary to live our lives every -- think about the quantity of pieces of technology you touch in any given day, and that technology is not static. If you think about how quickly both the hardware and then if you think about what I will call \"the software\" things like generative AI or like VR and AR, how much that is changing, that will all drive form, feature changes in the product, which is part of what underlies our confidence. At some point people want to -- and we know this based on lots of history through recessions, through lots of different types of industry performance, people will upgrade and want to replace their equipment and their consumer electronics. And so, I think what gives us confidence is understanding that there is a very large vendor community out there that is very interested in continuing to stimulate demand, continuing to create really cool solutions for our customers. And that, over time, I don't see a world where we rely less on technology. And so that -- it is all those underpinnings that are giving us confidence as we head out of this year and into next year. Now we said that -- and I'll repeat it, that is based on what we can see today, it's based on the environment as we understand it today. So, of course, we're going to continue to monitor and see how consumers navigate what is, obviously, a very volatile environment, but that underpinning of how different this industry is versus any others in terms of both need and constant innovation, that is the biggest part that underscores, and then obviously, our position within it and how confident we feel in our partnership with our vendors, that is what gives us the confidence as we head into next year. Yes. We hit out a little bit in the prepared remarks, but they remain more engaged customers. They tend to spend more, they tend to shop across categories, they tend -- on the whole, so I'm just going to talk about this big kind of lump of members, they tend to be our most engaged customers. Now, what a couple of years of paid membership has given us though is a lot of data around what is it customers distinctly value. Because there's really three things you're trying to do with any membership program: you're trying to acquire customers, you're trying to retain customers, and you're constantly trying to engage customers. Acquisition, retention and engagement are the cornerstones of any membership program. And so, Brian, what we've been spending time on is not just who are we acquiring, but do they stay engaged with the program? Are we retaining them? And so, it's not just about kind of the full, here's what we see in our customers. They're, for sure, more engaged and they're having better experiences. But now we can start to kind of bifurcate that large customer base into different need states. And we definitely see a customer who's really oriented around value and convenience, and we definitely see a customer who's really oriented around more fulsome service and support. And this gives us the opportunity, given all the now very rich customer data we have, to start to target each of those kind of populations of customers based on a more tailored offering that we believe will resonate with them. Yes, I'm going to start with the second part of the question, I'll work my way backwards. There is still very specialized labor in our stores. And we are very proud of that, and we are working very hard to make sure that we retain and continue to develop that very specialized experience over time. I think what we're trying to do is make sure that we are most effectively matching our labor, some of which is specialized, like any retailer, some of which is more kind of part-time and generalized in nature, that we are matching that specifically with how many and what type of people are coming into our stores and what it is that they need. And so, we have continued to obviously invest in wages. We were one of the first to go to a minimum $15. Our hourly wages are up more than 25% versus pre-pandemic. We're overarchingly investing hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits, and also, importantly, investing in career development and culture. And then really doing a lot of work to make sure we are bringing our employees along as we make these changes, involving them in the decisions and really trying to make sure that they feel like they also have a voice. And I think, how do we measure that? Well, one way is, obviously, we're looking at turnover, and we're pretty constantly looking at turnover. And we believe our general approach is working. Our turnover remains very low versus retail averages. It's consistent year-over-year. It is incredibly low in some of the most key areas like our general managers, where our turnover is in the mid-single digits, even given everything that RGMs have gone through in the last four years in particular. And I think that is one of the indicators. A second indicator, we continue to see a very high level of applications. Our applications have grown substantially year-over-year. So, you're seeing people want to come into the business, which is a good sign, because that means that GMs are pulling them into the business. And then third, you can imagine, we measure employee engagement. And we measure it very consistently. And not just at the high level, like here's the number. We're looking literally regionally, store-by-store, distribution center by distribution center, how engaged are our employees? And what can we do? How do we read those verbatims? How do we pull the themes? So, we are doing everything we can to create the most engaged workforce. So, it is constant work. It is not easy for our employees to go through this level of constant change, and I am incredibly proud that so many are choosing to stay with us and continue to build this culture for the future. Thank you. I think we have a great history, I would argue, in optimizing ROIC and making those educated bets. I would use even our store footprint as an example, things like our Experience stores, our outlets. There's a reason that we are pursuing those with vigor. And you can imagine what we're seeing in terms of return on those investments is giving us a lot of confidence into the future. There're other places where we're still testing and trying to make sure we feel like that ROIC is in line. So I think we're point to that continuing to drive that return for our investors. And with that, I think that was our last question. So thank you for joining us today. I hope that many of the investors for listening today will be able to join us for our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 14. So, thank you, and have a great day."
