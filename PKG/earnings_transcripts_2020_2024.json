Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Holly and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. And then turn the call over to Tom and Bob who\u2019ll provide more details. I\u2019ll then wrap things up and we\u2019d be glad to take questions.\nTom Hassfurther: Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year. Set another way, although there were three less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%. For the full year annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day up 5.8% and 5.4% respectively, with one more shipping day compared to 2019. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year\u2019s fourth quarter, as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point of purchase display business, as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period. Export containerboard prices were a $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019, as well as the third quarter of 2020. As expected late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases, while we don\u2019t comment on forward pricing specifics; we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $10 million with sales of $156 million or 6% margin compared to fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA of $53 million in sales of $244 million or a 22% margin. For the full year 2020, Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $73 million with sales of $675 million or an 11% margin compared to the full year 2019 EBITDA of $213 million with sales of $964 million or a 22% margin. Market conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic, as expected sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels, and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019. As mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand in optimal inventory levels, and we\u2019ll run our paper system accordingly. Average paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020, and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks, Mark. For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million; common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments, and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand, or just over $1.1 billion including marketable securities. Our liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion. For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion. We had capital spending of $421 million. Free cash flow was $612 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25%. And our final report at cash tax rate was 18%. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion, since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier. DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million. Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a non-operating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020. We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million. Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million. Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. As they have done throughout this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity, in both their personal and work lives, to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company. Not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction. Without question we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year; however, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed. Our manufacturing and sales organizations continue to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic, as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes. Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills. And our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively, as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company. I am very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we have built with our customers and suppliers over many years. Looking ahead as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong, with shipments exceeding those of last year\u2019s record first quarter. This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson Mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers.\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question is going to come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.\nGeorge Staphos: Good morning. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question I had regarding Jackson Mill and the containerboard that you produced in the fourth quarter, I was wondering if you could give us any kind of additional qualitative or quantitative commentary on the effect in the quarter in terms of additional costs? I know, it\u2019s might be sensitive, but thought you be able to cover at least a little bit of additional detail there?\nMark Kowlzan: We\u2019re not going to give the exact costs. We called it out, as very high cost production. As you could imagine, without spending the capital on the mill that you would normally spend on a conversion that would help you with the pulpy yield as an example, and various features on the paper machine to improve drawing capability. You\u2019re limited in productivity and also again, fiber yield. So the costs obviously are the highest in our systems, but nevertheless, the machine exceeded our expectations in terms of its productivity. And we were extremely pleased during the quarter. The machine accomplished what we needed and that was providing our box plant system they needed tons to continue supplying the box demand for the quarter and try to build a little inventory. Again, we\u2019re extremely pleased, the effort also enabled us to fully understand what we believed would be inappropriate phased approach to consider a conversion of the mill to containerboard. In much of the same way, we looked at DeRidder mill and the Wallula mill. So we\u2019ll be going forward with a discussion with the Board of Directors in February on our different options and alternatives on how we want to approach that. But we\u2019re very pleased. Again, the machine has performed quite well. And as I also called out in October, that machine is just an outstanding paper machine and the mill itself has a lot of great opportunity to go forward. Bob, you want to add anything?\nBob Mundy: No. I\u2019d just say, George that from \u2013 bringing I guess some of the write-ups that have come out last night and so forth. But the impact from Jackson was probably what drove that difference that that people were noticing in the fourth quarter relative to the cost side on the packaging segment.\nGeorge Staphos: Right. That makes sense. Next question, I want to hit on, is on costs, to the extent you can give us a little bit of additional directional guidance. And then my last question will be on kind of what volume you\u2019re seeing early in the quarter? So on the items that you could perhaps have some line of sight on, and if we compare it to the year-on-year impact in the fourth quarter, what would you say, well, we have maintenance outages, but on freight and on energy and any other costs that you again could talk to, should be as direction versus the fourth quarter year-on-year change, when we look at first quarter. So that\u2019s question number one. And question number two, Tom, if you can talk about your early shipments and bookings. That would be great. Thank you, guys.\nBob Mundy: Yes, George, I\u2019d say that, just as we look from the fourth to the first similar to the comments that Mark made, freight costs, we expect those to stay high and actually move up a bit more. And as well as OCC costs, recycled fiber prices are moving up. Certainly, as we reset a new year, our fringes and benefits on our labor costs, as well as any increases in wage rates, that will be an impact as we move from the fourth to the first. And then also on a lot of outside services and materials supplies things of that nature, as a headwind as well. But to your point, outages \u2013 maintenance outages will be favorable moving as we move into the first quarter. Of course, the benefits will be on the \u2013 as Tom mentioned, the price realization that we\u2019ve got a small piece of that in the fourth, but we expect the vast majority to come in the first quarter.\nTom Hassfurther: And George, this is Tom, I\u2019ll comment on the volumes. It remains incredibly strong through 16 days, our billings are up just slightly over 10% and our bookings are well north of that. So business remains very robust. I\u2019ll also just add on the cost side with this dramatic increase in volumes and shuffling business between plants and having plants cover for each other and things like that, that obviously drives our costs up as well, especially in area freight.\nGeorge Staphos: Understood. Thank you, guys. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.\nMark Wilde: Good Morning, Mark. Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Bob. I wondered, Mark, just on Jackson, two questions. First, can you give us some sense of differences between what you might have to do at Jackson versus what you did at DeRidder and Wallula? And then maybe some sense of what other options might be out there for you beyond Jackson?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. As you could imagine, let\u2019s go back to things we\u2019ve said for years and years, you can convert any mill to make anything depending on how much capital you\u2019re willing to spend on that conversion. That being said, if you look at a mill like DeRidder and mill like Wallula, they\u2019re all unique. They have their strengths and weaknesses that you have to address with capital, Jackson\u2019s no different. What you would be typically looking at is, in the pulp mill, hot stock refining, defiberizing, various pumping capabilities that would allow you to raise cap on the paper machine itself with stock approach, additional refining capabilities, and just mass throughput capabilities with the running containable versus a lightweight fiber. So then you\u2019re looking at head box dynamics drainage formation in terms of the former, and then pressing and drying, and then winder modifications and roll handling. So there\u2019s a comprehensive checklist that you have to go through in doing your analysis, but those are the type of things you would look at. And that those are the items that we\u2019ve now have, a really good understanding of the capability and the limitations, so it\u2019s helped us refine our expected scope. But nevertheless, you\u2019re talking about a project at a minimum that\u2019s in the hundreds of millions of dollars to convert Jackson mill and do it the way PCA would do a conversion. But it would be a good project. And so we have other alternatives, obviously, we\u2019re looking at. I don\u2019t want to get into those. You can imagine, they include everything from further investments and existing assets to looking at other mills in mill opportunities. So that hasn\u2019t changed for years now. So again, that discussion will be a discussion we have with the board in February.\nMark Wilde: Okay, Mark. Just if I could uncheck them, that\u2019s a newer machine than either DeRidder or Wallula has, if I\u2019m not wrong. And then also, would there be an option to actually do something a little different at Jackson, like make white top, I don\u2019t think you produce any white top. The market seems to be moving in that direction.\nMark Kowlzan: The machine has the potential to do that. The machine is an extremely modern machine, approximately 1990 vintage machine. It was one of the last big machines built during that period of time, 385-inch wide, high-speed. We taking care of it, as you can imagine, it\u2019s a really great asset. And that being said, we understand what we would do as it differs, it\u2019s a much better quality machine than what we had at DeRidder and what we had at Wallula in terms of its capability. And so it does provide us a long-term opportunity. Again, depending on the scope of work we choose to go forward with right now to become one of our premier machines in the future and also addressing the cost of the production. So we have that opportunity to spend capital and then as we\u2019ve done at DeRidder and Wallula provide the necessary containerboard into our box plant system as needed.\nMark Wilde: Okay. All right. And then just finally, Mark with OCC going up, can you just remind us, if we factor in that OCC stuff from out of Wallula, what\u2019s your net purchase of OCC? If we kind of \u2013 as we exclude the stuff you transfer from your own box plants, how much OCC are you buying right now on the open market on an annual basis?\nMark Kowlzan: I mean, I can\u2019t give you that right now. We\u2019ll have to get back to the after the call, but we\u2019re probably net-net around 15% of our total fiber base into our mills.\nMark Wilde: Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it off.\nTom Hassfurther: I do want to throw a tonnage purchase number at you and we\u2019ll get that exact number when we talk with you later. We\u2019re somewhere around 15% of total furnish \u2013 fiber furnish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.\nMark Connelly: Thanks. Mark, we\u2019re hearing from a range of companies outside of this industry about operating in logistics problems, really not transportation that are making running full and delivering on time more challenging, especially in the Midwest. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing that from your customer base yet most of those comments started to happen in mid-November. And so I wonder if the impact is really more whole 1Q thing.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, as the positivity rate in the COVID pandemic during that holiday period of November and December was spiking throughout various regions. And the demand was at all time records from the containerboard mills to the box plants, to the box customers. You can only imagine that when you\u2019re a carrier, whether it\u2019s a trucking carrier or a rail carrier, and you now have this unprecedented demand along with your workforce that is being challenged with this pandemic. A direct example of that is, at any given time during those few months, we had upwards of a 100 people in our mill system that were out either quarantining or positive, and then same thing in the box plans. So it was a challenge and we saw that through the logistics chain on how our customers were dealing with this and how our carriers we\u2019re dealing with this, and their own workforce capability. And so it was the human factor and the rolling stock factor in terms of trucks and rail in order to move the goods, like say, to meet the unprecedented demand. And as Tom said, in many cases, we were moving product from plant to plant and plants were cooperating with one another. So it was a very challenging time in that regard.\nMark Connelly: Okay. And Mark, you\u2019ve said in the past that you might have as many as a dozen box plant debottlenecking or other projects going on at any one time. I\u2019m curious whether you\u2019ve shifted that sort of pace and resources whether it\u2019s shifted either in the amount of effort or whether you\u2019re shifting your priorities to move closer to e-commerce or some other part of your customer base, has there been a meaningful change in the way you\u2019re approaching box plant capacity?\nMark Kowlzan: Tom, I\u2019ll let you go ahead and talk about that.\nTom Hassfurther: No. We\u2019ve continue to do our projects on schedule, on time for the most part, providing our suppliers can give us what we need. We\u2019ve got a great technology and engineering group that we\u2019re executing at a very high level. And obviously, we\u2019ve talked many, many times about the fact that we build our business around our customers and their demands, and we\u2019ll continue to do so Mark.\nMark Connelly: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. \nMark Weintraub: Thank you. I was hoping to get more color on the recent demand strengthened and by category or by the drivers, as you are seeing them. And then we\u2019d also love to get your thoughts on what happens to demand, how sustainable it is when the economy eventually reopened more fully?\nTom Hassfurther: Mark, this is Tom. I\u2019ll handle that. Our demand strength is basically across all segments with the exception of food service. Obviously, it no surprise e-commerce is growing at a faster rate than those other segments, but they\u2019re all in growth mode, which is great, which also, I think signals very clearly that this demand is strong across the board and sustainable going forward. I would contend that a lot of purchasing habits have changed probably accelerated by five years or more. And those are expected to remain the same. We\u2019re also seeing obviously the big trends in people moving away from cities, buying homes, when you buy homes, there\u2019s a lot of things that go into those homes that are associated with corrugated boxes. And then addition, you\u2019ve got this trend moving away from plastics into paper-related products, which is also very positive going forward. So the demand strength, is it sustainable? I\u2019d say absolutely, yes.\nMark Weintraub: Great. And maybe can give us a sense as to how much growth you\u2019re seeing for instance in e-commerce and how you define as\u2026\nTom Hassfurther: Well, we don\u2019t typically share our numbers per segment, but as I said, it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s obviously significant and it\u2019s higher than the other segments. But again, all those segments are growing, and of course, we expect food service to come back as well and is already beginning to as States began to open.\nMark Weintraub: Great. And we did \u2013 it seems like in the last couple of months, we\u2019ve seen even a new step-up from what was already stepped up. And again, just that was evenly broadly across everything. Or was it more specified to certain areas?\nTom Hassfurther: No, I\u2019d say again, that is across the board and keep in mind also that we\u2019re hearing from every one of our customers, their inventories are very low. They have not been able to replenish any inventory as a result of the strong demand on their side.\nMark Weintraub: And one last one, do you think even with this latest step-up in demand, they\u2019re still not replenishing those inventories, or do you think that part of this 10% plus type of demand growth that we\u2019re seeing might represent some replenishing at this point?\nTom Hassfurther: Some may represent replenishing, but we\u2019re hearing from our customers, they\u2019re still desperate to try to replenish any inventory. That\u2019s all I can tell you at this stage.\nMark Weintraub: Super. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning everyone. One question on \u2013 just back to Jackson for a second, what would a conversion of the machine there do to your ability to service your large paper customers? And relatedly, what are your expectations for cut size demand this year? Obviously, the pandemic had a huge impact last year and will likely continue to for the next several months, I would imagine. So I\u2019m just wondering what your outlook for paper demand and specifically cut size demand is just as we go into this year? And how that\u2019s affecting your thought process about Jackson as well?\nMark Kowlzan: As you could imagine, the demand is still down at the levels we saw throughout last year. This first quarter is not much better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. I would expect as the economy finally recovers and you have workplaces starting to come to some new semblance of normalcy and schools fully opening up across the country all the way up to a higher education, that at some point over the next year. Demand will pick up to a new norm. I don\u2019t really know what that new normal will be. I do have to believe that there has been now a permanent demand destruction of some number that people have learned working from home, how they do their business. And so Jackson currently affords us the opportunity to short-term, take advantage of the asset and make again, a high cost, very good quality containerboard. But at the same time, you would have to assume that our box demand grows and our paper demand destruction remains at a certain level, that it will be difficult to justify having a very large machine that only is able to fill its orders for a portion of the time in the future years. So we\u2019re looking at that as an opportunity that we have a very strong need for the containerboard. And as we\u2019ve always done, we have long-term filled those needs internally rather than go out to the outside market. And even if we want it to go to the outside market, now there are no tons to be purchased. And so we believe that Jackson ultimately will be a far better asset in the containerboard side of the business ultimately. What the timing is, I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m just thinking over the next couple of years that timing will play out.\nAdam Josephson: Yes. Sure. And as you\u2019re thinking about the paper business again, longer term, I know it\u2019s really difficult to make forecasts of anything these days, but there\u2019s been some permanent destruction you think, do you think there\u2019s a reason to expect a rebound in cut size demand for the full year or next year? Or do you think that we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019ve established a new lower base. And hopefully, we hold this space and not go much lower than that.\nMark Kowlzan: Again, I don\u2019t know. I just \u2013 from my own personal observations and what we see around us, I would have to believe that even post pandemic, there will be some new lower demand efficiency that businesses and schools and individuals are learning to function with. And that will just continue to play out. So we\u2019re in a position that we have the optionality on how we utilize assets. And we\u2019re just going to play that optionality out. Again, it\u2019s hard for me to, start giving you a numbers. There\u2019s nothing I could base them on.\nAdam Josephson: Sure, sure. And I fully understand. And just on OCC, your near-term outlook, how much inflation sequentially are you expecting? And I\u2019m just asking in the context of ocean container availability being exceptional and limited, and presumably that having an impact on OCC export volumes, I\u2019m just wondering, what\u2019s driving your expectation of continued OCC inflation? How sustainable you think that\u2019ll be and the magnitude of the inflation you\u2019re expecting sequentially?\nBob Mundy: I\u2019m sorry, sequential it\u2019s probably $0.03 or $0.04 as we move into the first quarter, based on where we see prices going.\nAdam Josephson: And just in terms of the drivers of that, just given the lack of availability of containers?\nBob Mundy: It\u2019s just absolute demand. Tom?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, I\u2019ll add. Let me add a couple of things there, Adam. We\u2019ve talked for a long time about the need for fiber around the world. And it took a while to digest China\u2019s exclusion of OCC and moving to other fiber. And as you see, pulp is up dramatically and being shipped over there as well as linerboard being shipped directly over to China as an example. So, they\u2019re just gaining their fiber in some other form, other than OCC. OCC has then found markets elsewhere around the world. The global outlook is very strong and we know it will continue to be so. So as we said, it found its bottom, it\u2019s moved up dramatically from that point and we expect it\u2019ll move up for \u2013 as well going forward as strictly just based on supply and demand.\nAdam Josephson: Got it. Thanks a lot Tom.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.\nGabe Hajde: Good morning, Mark, Bob, Tom.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Gabe.\nGabe Hajde: I think the CapEx figure at least relative to what I was expecting is a little bit higher. And I was just curious if there were any kind of discrete projects in there that you would like to call out for us. I recognize that there\u2019s probably some either preparation work or ongoing maybe projects at Jackson to continue producing containerboard or swinging between the two grades. But I\u2019m more thinking down on the converting operations. And then there was that DeRidder project that you guys had kind of pushed out. So if there\u2019s anything you can call it for us, that\u2019d be helpful.\nMark Kowlzan: There\u2019s nothing significance in terms of anything unique right now, besides we\u2019ve gotten dozens and dozens of great projects that we\u2019re working on in the box plants. We\u2019ve got projects that we\u2019re addressing in the mills that will address cost and efficiencies. And so it\u2019s just an entire category and host of projects \u2013 numerous projects in our box plant system that the group is working on. But it\u2019s no one big, it\u2019s not like building a new Richland box plant that\u2019s taking up the bulk of the capitals, dozens and dozens of \u2013 in many cases, new converting equipment installations, modifications. Again, mill equipment installations that will address some opportunities we have. So it\u2019s \u2013 which is the good news. These are low risk, high return, quick return type opportunities that we\u2019re addressing. Again, we\u2019re \u2013 things that we\u2019re good at doing.\nGabe Hajde: Thank you, Mark. So to be clear, there\u2019s nothing in there for a potential Jackson conversion?\nMark Kowlzan: Not at this time.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And then maybe Tom, I know it\u2019s difficult sometimes to speak to the competitive landscape. But given what we read on the outside world in terms of new capacity coming in. Are there particular grades or end markets where customers are saying, hey, we\u2019d like you to add capabilities here because you don\u2019t necessarily have it and maybe that\u2019s a competitive threat and maybe that plays into what some of Mark\u2019s talking about in terms of new converting capabilities. I\u2019m just trying to understand where you guys are best positioned, I guess.\nTom Hassfurther: Well, let me kind of start at the beginning a little bit here, Gabe. You might ask, you might start with the question of, again, why Jackson and what we\u2019re doing at Jackson? And as we alluded to earlier, the fact is I can\u2019t buy any tons in the open market. We have a great volume demand. We have great need, if anything, our customers are concerned that we have enough supply, even as an industry. So consequently, we were fortunate to be able to have this great asset as Mark alluded to that\u2019s not going to produce at its normal rate because of the destruction of demand in the white business. And we were able to convert it, and yes, it\u2019s at a high cost, but great quality. It kept us going, it gave us the ability to grow, gave us the ability to satisfy our customers and was incredibly integral to our ability to continue this growth trend. Now when it comes to white and some other things, we have trade agreements, we\u2019ve got some other arrangements where we\u2019re in good shape there. So we\u2019re not really that concerned about that. But \u2013 again, what you see, and I think it\u2019s important to point out that what\u2019s going on \u2013 what we observe at least in the marketplace and our inability to buy any additional tons, we would have only bought those for a short period of time anyway, because we intend to be fully integrated and supply our own tons. And I would assume others might think the same way. But it\u2019s important to note that some of these projects that are continually mentioned out there that are the one-offs, somebody\u2019s going to put a mill in with no downstream cut-up very difficult to do. I don\u2019t know where they get the customer base. Again, I can only speak for ourselves. We\u2019re going to supply ourselves. We\u2019re not buyers in the open market. So I\u2019m not \u2013 we have to take care of ourselves, I guess that\u2019s the point. And you see very few of these one-offs ever come off. I can name one that did, and it\u2019s now shutdown. So I\u2019m not really concerned about that. We have to take care of ourselves and we have to figure out our own supply.\nGabe Hajde: Very much appreciated.\nBob Mundy: Hopefully that gives you an answer that you can digest.\nGabe Hajde: It does. Thanks.\nMark Kowlzan: All right. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Neel Kumar, Morgan Stanley.\nNeel Kumar: Hi. Good morning. In terms of freight, you mentioned that you made $0.07 headwind for you year-over-year. And your expectation of it stain pretty elevated. Just, can you give us a sense of the magnitude inflation you\u2019re seeing in freight rates year-over-year? Is it in the low double digit percent level? And then if you just remind us how your freight expenses is split between trucking versus rail.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, Neel, I\u2019d say it\u2019s \u2013 the year-over-year increase in our costs, as we look out 2021 versus 2020 is I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 right now, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that high. It\u2019s certainly the higher single digits as a percent, but not into the double digit, so at least not what we see right now. And our split as far as rail versus truck, roughly 70% the cost, 70% rail, 30% truck, but obviously, box plants typically use trucks to deliver their products and mills are using rail. But that\u2019s sort of the breakdown of the cost.\nTom Hassfurther: Hey, Neel, it\u2019s Tom. I\u2019d also add that we are a little bit concerned about rail costs going up, going forward as a result of this new administration\u2019s taken out the pipeline and being less interested in, in piping oil which could lead back to the shortage of boxcars that we had at one time when the rail cars \u2013 when the rail industry all went to shipping oil.\nMark Kowlzan: Land congestion, yes.\nNeel Kumar: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I just had a couple of questions on the scope of M&A opportunities you would consider just given that your balance sheet offers you a lot of optionality. Are you largely interested in small bolt-ons of box plants, or would you be open to something larger? And is there a specific size cut-off? And just given your track record in pursuing paper conversions, the containerboard, would you consider opportunities to acquire paper mills for conversion opportunity? Or do you see too many unknown variables in doing that?\nMark Kowlzan: As far as M&A activity, as we\u2019ve always done, we look at all opportunities, bolt-on small acquisition, as well as larger opportunities are always considered and looked at as far as any other opportunities. Again, it just depends on the specifics that you would always have to consider if you were talking about spending x dollars to convert current asset, as opposed to being able to buy a mill asset from somebody. And what\u2019s the differential in the ultimate total investment. So that\u2019s always a consideration. So I would say that all of the above are always on the table to evaluate and consider.\nNeel Kumar: All right. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. In white paper with the 30% sequential decline in shipments, you obviously had the conversion at Jackson and the outage at I Falls. I think you referenced weaker market demand as well. I\u2019m just wondering of those lower white paper volumes, how much was sort of planned and expected versus maybe unexpected market weakness? Or sort of how did volumes hold up versus maybe what you expected going into the quarter?\nMark Kowlzan: Rounding off, when the pandemic started in the March-April period, when we saw the massive decline, we\u2019re down say, on average 30% of the year. And that\u2019s what we saw going through the December period. And even as we look at the first quarter now, we\u2019re probably in that 25% to 30% demand destruction in terms of our business from where it was a year ago. It\u2019s not declining further, but it\u2019s not getting better in any significant manner.\nBob Mundy: Yes. Anthony, I\u2019ll just add relative to the quarter. One thing to keep in mind as far as the results in the Paper segment, the volumes were about where we thought they would be. But one of the things that impacted paper was our outage costs that we had for the quarter, there\u2019s like $0.10 negative impact year-over-year in paper, packaging not \u2013 it was actually a slight positive, I believe. But that was a big hit on our paper results in the fourth quarter.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then Bob, is it possible to quantify or put a finer point on the level of wage inflation and timing increases for fringes of benefits that you see step up in the New Year either on a percentage basis or maybe sort of relative to what you saw last year?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, right now it\u2019s in that 3% to 4% range is what we\u2019re seeing. And that\u2019s coming off of actually as Tom, I think alluded to, especially in the fourth quarter, our labor costs just to run \u2013 to get the volume out of our box plants, converting costs and so forth. We had to pay a lot of overtime and we were running really, really hard. And so, our wages and what have you in the fourth quarter were high, and they\u2019d been in the high \u2013 they\u2019ve been like that pretty much the most of the year to meet the demand. So those percentages I\u2019m giving you are off a year that has had very high labor cost to begin with.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just one final one, if I could. I think your participation in the export market is very small. Now with Jackson, assuming you pursue a larger conversion and understanding this is potentially far off. Is that mill close enough to the Gulf Coast that you could potentially export if you needed to as a safety valve? Or is that something that\u2019s not possible? Just kind of wondering down the road on exports out of Jackson?\nMark Kowlzan: Let me answer it this way. If I were to invest to convert Jackson, I would not be considering an export opportunity in the savings calculus. A conversion at Jackson would be fully to supply our own needs. And that is how we would look at a conversion. We have no desire to build capacity and then we\u2019ll have to move it off shore, our own capacity, we\u2019ll move through our own box plant system.\nAnthony Pettinari: Understood. That makes sense. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: Hey, good morning. Hope everyone\u2019s doing well. Thanks for taking the questions. Most of the outages are weighted to the fourth quarter of this year. And just curious if we should kind of read into this at all in terms of how you anticipate demand playing out for the year. Do you anticipate Q4 kind of getting back to those normalized levels, which allows you to have a higher outage this quarter?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. I\u2019ll let Bob finish this up, but if you \u2013 one of the big factors this year we have the outage that we had planned at the DeRidder mill that was originally going to be executed in the fall of 2020. We postponed that because originally to be considered in the spring and then we pushed it off. But because of demand, we\u2019ve now moved that work plus the annual work into the fourth quarter of this year. So the work that will be done at DeRidder will be the normal annual work that has to be done along with the discretionary opportunity work that we have on the recovery boiler the number one machine. And so that\u2019s why \u2013 that\u2019s just one factor in why the fourth quarter number is higher. Bob, you want to add some color to that?\nBob Mundy: No, just perfect.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay.\nKyle White: Got it. That was going to be my follow-up on DeRidder, I wasn\u2019t curious. But I\u2019m curious kind of just following up on this in terms of your visibility on demand and what kind of confidence that you have that this demand that we\u2019re seeing right now is sustainable. Obviously backlogs are up and customers need to restore their inventories at some point. But from an underlying demand standpoint, what kind of confidence and visibility do you have there for the backdrop of this year?\nTom Hassfurther: I can\u2019t, it\u2019s hard to predict what the back half of this year is going to be Kyle, but I would just say that our demand levels will be higher for sure than they were in 2020 throughout the entire year. And we\u2019re starting out incredibly strong and we\u2019re not waiting any mill outage based on suppose the demand being less than the fourth quarter than it is in the first quarter. It\u2019s very hard to predict. But everything I\u2019m hearing and all the indicators we get from our customers and the various segments, it\u2019s going to be very strong all year.\nKyle White: All right. Perfect. Thank you. Good luck.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Kyle. Holly, any other questions?\nOperator: We do.  And our next question is going to come from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.\nPhilip Ng: Hey, good morning, everyone. Sorry. I got cut off a little bit. So if I\u2019m repeating this question, I apologize in advance. Demand obviously very, very strong, just curious how extended are your backlogs at this point? And do you expect inventory to improve sequentially and being able to better service all of your customers in the first quarter.\nTom Hassfurther: We\u2019re not going to \u2013 we don\u2019t get into backlogs. Most of our orders on a very short lead time and we\u2019re able to meet those demands at the moment. We\u2019re very fortunate because we made some significant investments throughout the years. We\u2019ve been very consistent doing that and it allowed us to respond accordingly to this demand. And as I said before, it\u2019s going to remain strong and I feel very confident. We\u2019re going to be able to meet all the requirements of our customers.\nPhilip Ng: That\u2019s helpful color. And as the vaccination process ramps up, is that an opportunity for you guys and do you have any exposure on that front?\nMark Kowlzan: In what terms? Is it box supply or\u2026\nPhilip Ng: I would assume that if there is lot of vaccines being transported through the country, there might be\u2026\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. So we\u2019re participating in this and proud to do so. It\u2019s very important that we get \u2013 that these vaccines get out and proud to be a part of the packaging side of distributing those vaccines.\nPhilip Ng: And do you envision that being a pretty meaningful contributor? Or just part of the ongoing growth story?\nTom Hassfurther: Not just the part of the ongoing, it\u2019s part of the ongoing, and it\u2019s going to have a start and then an end eventually. But it\u2019s one of those areas where we take great pride in being able to contribute to hopefully putting an end to this pandemic.\nPhilip Ng: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Just one last question. Your largest customer in paper could be merging with the competitor. Is there a change of control provision in your supply agreement? Any color would be really helpful.\nMark Kowlzan: I know the contract runs through next year, and so I don\u2019t know the details in that regard. I would doubt there is a change of control clause. We can check on that and get back with you. But we\u2019re good through the end of next year.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just one last one, and if you\u2019re able to share any color. You mentioned Mark that, if you do ramp up Jackson\u2019s probably more of a phased approach. And with that process, would you be able to continue to produce board and could that help your cost profile throughout the year? Thanks a lot and good luck on the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Again, right now, with what we\u2019re producing, we have a home for all of these tons in our own system. Now, the bigger opportunity with the capital investment at Jackson over the next say 24 months would be to address not only additional incremental productivity off the asset, but also a major cost reduction from the asset. So in that regard, we will continue to run to demand, if demand dictated that containerboard was not needed and paper was needed for the time being, we could make paper. So we haven\u2019t eliminated the capability of making paper on the machine at this time. It\u2019s just that the overwhelming demand for containerboard far outweighs the opportunities for paper.\nPhilip Ng: Got it. Super helpful, guys. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other questions please?\nOperator: And we do have a follow-up question and that\u2019ll come from the line of Mark Wilde, Bank of Montreal.\nMark Kowlzan: Go ahead, Mark.\nMark Wilde: A quick follow-up for Tom. Tom, there were a couple of foreign players that put a lot of capacity into Central Indiana. I know that\u2019s not too far from where TimBar was headquartered. Can you just talk about sort of any impact you might be feeling from all of that new converting capacity?\nTom Hassfurther: I would just say Mark, we\u2019ve had zero impact from that capacity.\nMark Wilde: Okay. That\u2019s helpful.\nTom Hassfurther: I can only speak for us. Okay.\nMark Kowlzan: Good deal. All right. Operator, I think we\u2019re about out of time.\nOperator: Yep. Mr. Kowlzan, I see that there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and stay well, be safe and look forward to talking with you in the April call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Once again, we\u2019d like to thank you for joining today\u2019s Packaging Corporation of America\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings results conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all time quarterly records for total box shipments up 9.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter, as well as shipments per day up 11.7% compared to last year. Set another way, although there were three less shipping days this quarter compared to the third quarter, our total fourth quarter shipments exceeded the third quarter by 2.2%. For the full year annual corrugated shipment records were set as well, both in total and per day up 5.8% and 5.4% respectively, with one more shipping day compared to 2019. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 16,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter, as we ran our containerboard system to supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.31 per share lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 and down $0.11 per share versus the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to a less rich mix as the graphics and point of purchase display business, as well as the produce business in the Pacific Northwest tails off during this period. Export containerboard prices were a $0.01 per share above both the fourth quarter of 2019, as well as the third quarter of 2020. As expected late in the quarter, we began to see the initial benefit of our recently announced Packaging segment price increases, while we don't comment on forward pricing specifics; we would expect to realize the vast majority of the increases during the first quarter of 2021. And George, this is Tom, I'll comment on the volumes. It remains incredibly strong through 16 days, our billings are up just slightly over 10% and our bookings are well north of that. So business remains very robust. I'll also just add on the cost side with this dramatic increase in volumes and shuffling business between plants and having plants cover for each other and things like that, that obviously drives our costs up as well, especially in area freight. I do want to throw a tonnage purchase number at you and we'll get that exact number when we talk with you later. We're somewhere around 15% of total furnish \u2013 fiber furnish. No. We've continue to do our projects on schedule, on time for the most part, providing our suppliers can give us what we need. We've got a great technology and engineering group that we're executing at a very high level. And obviously, we've talked many, many times about the fact that we build our business around our customers and their demands, and we'll continue to do so Mark. Mark, this is Tom. I'll handle that. Our demand strength is basically across all segments with the exception of food service. Obviously, it no surprise e-commerce is growing at a faster rate than those other segments, but they're all in growth mode, which is great, which also, I think signals very clearly that this demand is strong across the board and sustainable going forward. I would contend that a lot of purchasing habits have changed probably accelerated by five years or more. And those are expected to remain the same. We're also seeing obviously the big trends in people moving away from cities, buying homes, when you buy homes, there's a lot of things that go into those homes that are associated with corrugated boxes. And then addition, you've got this trend moving away from plastics into paper-related products, which is also very positive going forward. So the demand strength, is it sustainable? I'd say absolutely, yes. Well, we don't typically share our numbers per segment, but as I said, it's been \u2013 it's obviously significant and it's higher than the other segments. But again, all those segments are growing, and of course, we expect food service to come back as well and is already beginning to as States began to open. No, I'd say again, that is across the board and keep in mind also that we're hearing from every one of our customers, their inventories are very low. They have not been able to replenish any inventory as a result of the strong demand on their side. Some may represent replenishing, but we're hearing from our customers, they're still desperate to try to replenish any inventory. That's all I can tell you at this stage. Yes, I'll add. Let me add a couple of things there, Adam. We've talked for a long time about the need for fiber around the world. And it took a while to digest China's exclusion of OCC and moving to other fiber. And as you see, pulp is up dramatically and being shipped over there as well as linerboard being shipped directly over to China as an example. So, they're just gaining their fiber in some other form, other than OCC. OCC has then found markets elsewhere around the world. The global outlook is very strong and we know it will continue to be so. So as we said, it found its bottom, it's moved up dramatically from that point and we expect it'll move up for \u2013 as well going forward as strictly just based on supply and demand. Well, let me kind of start at the beginning a little bit here, Gabe. You might ask, you might start with the question of, again, why Jackson and what we're doing at Jackson? And as we alluded to earlier, the fact is I can't buy any tons in the open market. We have a great volume demand. We have great need, if anything, our customers are concerned that we have enough supply, even as an industry. So consequently, we were fortunate to be able to have this great asset as Mark alluded to that's not going to produce at its normal rate because of the destruction of demand in the white business. And we were able to convert it, and yes, it's at a high cost, but great quality. It kept us going, it gave us the ability to grow, gave us the ability to satisfy our customers and was incredibly integral to our ability to continue this growth trend. Now when it comes to white and some other things, we have trade agreements, we've got some other arrangements where we're in good shape there. So we're not really that concerned about that. But \u2013 again, what you see, and I think it's important to point out that what's going on \u2013 what we observe at least in the marketplace and our inability to buy any additional tons, we would have only bought those for a short period of time anyway, because we intend to be fully integrated and supply our own tons. And I would assume others might think the same way. But it's important to note that some of these projects that are continually mentioned out there that are the one-offs, somebody's going to put a mill in with no downstream cut-up very difficult to do. I don't know where they get the customer base. Again, I can only speak for ourselves. We're going to supply ourselves. We're not buyers in the open market. So I'm not \u2013 we have to take care of ourselves, I guess that's the point. And you see very few of these one-offs ever come off. I can name one that did, and it's now shutdown. So I'm not really concerned about that. We have to take care of ourselves and we have to figure out our own supply. Hey, Neel, it's Tom. I'd also add that we are a little bit concerned about rail costs going up, going forward as a result of this new administration's taken out the pipeline and being less interested in, in piping oil which could lead back to the shortage of boxcars that we had at one time when the rail cars \u2013 when the rail industry all went to shipping oil. I can't, it's hard to predict what the back half of this year is going to be Kyle, but I would just say that our demand levels will be higher for sure than they were in 2020 throughout the entire year. And we're starting out incredibly strong and we're not waiting any mill outage based on suppose the demand being less than the fourth quarter than it is in the first quarter. It's very hard to predict. But everything I'm hearing and all the indicators we get from our customers and the various segments, it's going to be very strong all year. Thank you. We're not going to \u2013 we don't get into backlogs. Most of our orders on a very short lead time and we're able to meet those demands at the moment. We're very fortunate because we made some significant investments throughout the years. We've been very consistent doing that and it allowed us to respond accordingly to this demand. And as I said before, it's going to remain strong and I feel very confident. We're going to be able to meet all the requirements of our customers. Yes. So we're participating in this and proud to do so. It's very important that we get \u2013 that these vaccines get out and proud to be a part of the packaging side of distributing those vaccines. Not just the part of the ongoing, it's part of the ongoing, and it's going to have a start and then an end eventually. But it's one of those areas where we take great pride in being able to contribute to hopefully putting an end to this pandemic. I would just say Mark, we've had zero impact from that capacity. I can only speak for us. Okay."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Holly and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. And then turn the call over to Tom and Bob who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions. Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $10 million with sales of $156 million or 6% margin compared to fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA of $53 million in sales of $244 million or a 22% margin. For the full year 2020, Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $73 million with sales of $675 million or an 11% margin compared to the full year 2019 EBITDA of $213 million with sales of $964 million or a 22% margin. Market conditions in the Paper segment continued to be challenged due to the nationwide responses to help control the spread of the pandemic, as expected sales volume was below seasonally stronger third quarter levels, and over 30% below the fourth quarter of 2019. As mentioned previously, with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill, the Jackson mill was restarted on white paper in October and produced both paper and containerboard during the fourth quarter. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand in optimal inventory levels, and we'll run our paper system accordingly. Average paper prices and mix were 1% below the third quarter of 2020, and approximately 3% below the fourth quarter of 2019. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. As they have done throughout this pandemic, our employees demonstrated tremendous resiliency to overcome adversity, in both their personal and work lives, to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company. Not the least of which was running our manufacturing and office locations safely during these times of constant change and distraction. Without question we experienced difficulties and unique challenges during the year; however, our employees never lost their resolve to succeed. Our manufacturing and sales organizations continue to successfully adapt to the needs of our customers during this period of unprecedented demand in our packaging business and also effectively manage the market challenges in our paper business brought on by the pandemic, as well as working through the impact of multiple hurricanes. Our engineering and technology organization has stayed on track with the key capital projects and process improvements for our box plants and mills. And our corporate staff groups found innovative solutions for remote working conditions to ensure we continue to manage the company effectively, as well as perform all of the necessary administrative activities that are necessary for our employees or are required as a public company. I am very proud of our accomplishments and the strong partnerships we have built with our customers and suppliers over many years. Looking ahead as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, our Packaging segment demand should remain strong, with shipments exceeding those of last year's record first quarter. This will require us to continue producing containerboard at our Jackson Mill in addition to an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain optimal inventory levels for servicing the paper customers. We're not going to give the exact costs. We called it out, as very high cost production. As you could imagine, without spending the capital on the mill that you would normally spend on a conversion that would help you with the pulpy yield as an example, and various features on the paper machine to improve drawing capability. You're limited in productivity and also again, fiber yield. So the costs obviously are the highest in our systems, but nevertheless, the machine exceeded our expectations in terms of its productivity. And we were extremely pleased during the quarter. The machine accomplished what we needed and that was providing our box plant system they needed tons to continue supplying the box demand for the quarter and try to build a little inventory. Again, we're extremely pleased, the effort also enabled us to fully understand what we believed would be inappropriate phased approach to consider a conversion of the mill to containerboard. In much of the same way, we looked at DeRidder mill and the Wallula mill. So we'll be going forward with a discussion with the Board of Directors in February on our different options and alternatives on how we want to approach that. But we're very pleased. Again, the machine has performed quite well. And as I also called out in October, that machine is just an outstanding paper machine and the mill itself has a lot of great opportunity to go forward. Bob, you want to add anything? Thank you. Next question, please. Yes. As you could imagine, let's go back to things we've said for years and years, you can convert any mill to make anything depending on how much capital you're willing to spend on that conversion. That being said, if you look at a mill like DeRidder and mill like Wallula, they're all unique. They have their strengths and weaknesses that you have to address with capital, Jackson's no different. What you would be typically looking at is, in the pulp mill, hot stock refining, defiberizing, various pumping capabilities that would allow you to raise cap on the paper machine itself with stock approach, additional refining capabilities, and just mass throughput capabilities with the running containable versus a lightweight fiber. So then you're looking at head box dynamics drainage formation in terms of the former, and then pressing and drying, and then winder modifications and roll handling. So there's a comprehensive checklist that you have to go through in doing your analysis, but those are the type of things you would look at. And that those are the items that we've now have, a really good understanding of the capability and the limitations, so it's helped us refine our expected scope. But nevertheless, you're talking about a project at a minimum that's in the hundreds of millions of dollars to convert Jackson mill and do it the way PCA would do a conversion. But it would be a good project. And so we have other alternatives, obviously, we're looking at. I don't want to get into those. You can imagine, they include everything from further investments and existing assets to looking at other mills in mill opportunities. So that hasn't changed for years now. So again, that discussion will be a discussion we have with the board in February. The machine has the potential to do that. The machine is an extremely modern machine, approximately 1990 vintage machine. It was one of the last big machines built during that period of time, 385-inch wide, high-speed. We taking care of it, as you can imagine, it's a really great asset. And that being said, we understand what we would do as it differs, it's a much better quality machine than what we had at DeRidder and what we had at Wallula in terms of its capability. And so it does provide us a long-term opportunity. Again, depending on the scope of work we choose to go forward with right now to become one of our premier machines in the future and also addressing the cost of the production. So we have that opportunity to spend capital and then as we've done at DeRidder and Wallula provide the necessary containerboard into our box plant system as needed. I mean, I can't give you that right now. We'll have to get back to the after the call, but we're probably net-net around 15% of our total fiber base into our mills. Well, as the positivity rate in the COVID pandemic during that holiday period of November and December was spiking throughout various regions. And the demand was at all time records from the containerboard mills to the box plants, to the box customers. You can only imagine that when you're a carrier, whether it's a trucking carrier or a rail carrier, and you now have this unprecedented demand along with your workforce that is being challenged with this pandemic. A direct example of that is, at any given time during those few months, we had upwards of a 100 people in our mill system that were out either quarantining or positive, and then same thing in the box plans. So it was a challenge and we saw that through the logistics chain on how our customers were dealing with this and how our carriers we're dealing with this, and their own workforce capability. And so it was the human factor and the rolling stock factor in terms of trucks and rail in order to move the goods, like say, to meet the unprecedented demand. And as Tom said, in many cases, we were moving product from plant to plant and plants were cooperating with one another. So it was a very challenging time in that regard. Tom, I'll let you go ahead and talk about that. Next question, please. Next question, please. As you could imagine, the demand is still down at the levels we saw throughout last year. This first quarter is not much better than what we saw in the fourth quarter. I would expect as the economy finally recovers and you have workplaces starting to come to some new semblance of normalcy and schools fully opening up across the country all the way up to a higher education, that at some point over the next year. Demand will pick up to a new norm. I don't really know what that new normal will be. I do have to believe that there has been now a permanent demand destruction of some number that people have learned working from home, how they do their business. And so Jackson currently affords us the opportunity to short-term, take advantage of the asset and make again, a high cost, very good quality containerboard. But at the same time, you would have to assume that our box demand grows and our paper demand destruction remains at a certain level, that it will be difficult to justify having a very large machine that only is able to fill its orders for a portion of the time in the future years. So we're looking at that as an opportunity that we have a very strong need for the containerboard. And as we've always done, we have long-term filled those needs internally rather than go out to the outside market. And even if we want it to go to the outside market, now there are no tons to be purchased. And so we believe that Jackson ultimately will be a far better asset in the containerboard side of the business ultimately. What the timing is, I'm not sure. I'm just thinking over the next couple of years that timing will play out. Again, I don't know. I just \u2013 from my own personal observations and what we see around us, I would have to believe that even post pandemic, there will be some new lower demand efficiency that businesses and schools and individuals are learning to function with. And that will just continue to play out. So we're in a position that we have the optionality on how we utilize assets. And we're just going to play that optionality out. Again, it's hard for me to, start giving you a numbers. There's nothing I could base them on. Next question please. Good morning, Gabe. There's nothing significance in terms of anything unique right now, besides we've gotten dozens and dozens of great projects that we're working on in the box plants. We've got projects that we're addressing in the mills that will address cost and efficiencies. And so it's just an entire category and host of projects \u2013 numerous projects in our box plant system that the group is working on. But it's no one big, it's not like building a new Richland box plant that's taking up the bulk of the capitals, dozens and dozens of \u2013 in many cases, new converting equipment installations, modifications. Again, mill equipment installations that will address some opportunities we have. So it's \u2013 which is the good news. These are low risk, high return, quick return type opportunities that we're addressing. Again, we're \u2013 things that we're good at doing. Not at this time. All right. Thank you. Next question, please. Yes, Neel, I'd say it's \u2013 the year-over-year increase in our costs, as we look out 2021 versus 2020 is I wouldn't \u2013 right now, I don't think it's that high. It's certainly the higher single digits as a percent, but not into the double digit, so at least not what we see right now. And our split as far as rail versus truck, roughly 70% the cost, 70% rail, 30% truck, but obviously, box plants typically use trucks to deliver their products and mills are using rail. But that's sort of the breakdown of the cost. Land congestion, yes. As far as M&A activity, as we've always done, we look at all opportunities, bolt-on small acquisition, as well as larger opportunities are always considered and looked at as far as any other opportunities. Again, it just depends on the specifics that you would always have to consider if you were talking about spending x dollars to convert current asset, as opposed to being able to buy a mill asset from somebody. And what's the differential in the ultimate total investment. So that's always a consideration. So I would say that all of the above are always on the table to evaluate and consider. Thank you. Next question. Rounding off, when the pandemic started in the March-April period, when we saw the massive decline, we're down say, on average 30% of the year. And that's what we saw going through the December period. And even as we look at the first quarter now, we're probably in that 25% to 30% demand destruction in terms of our business from where it was a year ago. It's not declining further, but it's not getting better in any significant manner. Well, right now it's in that 3% to 4% range is what we're seeing. And that's coming off of actually as Tom, I think alluded to, especially in the fourth quarter, our labor costs just to run \u2013 to get the volume out of our box plants, converting costs and so forth. We had to pay a lot of overtime and we were running really, really hard. And so, our wages and what have you in the fourth quarter were high, and they'd been in the high \u2013 they've been like that pretty much the most of the year to meet the demand. So those percentages I'm giving you are off a year that has had very high labor cost to begin with. Let me answer it this way. If I were to invest to convert Jackson, I would not be considering an export opportunity in the savings calculus. A conversion at Jackson would be fully to supply our own needs. And that is how we would look at a conversion. We have no desire to build capacity and then we'll have to move it off shore, our own capacity, we'll move through our own box plant system. Okay. Next question, please. Yes. I'll let Bob finish this up, but if you \u2013 one of the big factors this year we have the outage that we had planned at the DeRidder mill that was originally going to be executed in the fall of 2020. We postponed that because originally to be considered in the spring and then we pushed it off. But because of demand, we've now moved that work plus the annual work into the fourth quarter of this year. So the work that will be done at DeRidder will be the normal annual work that has to be done along with the discretionary opportunity work that we have on the recovery boiler the number one machine. And so that's why \u2013 that's just one factor in why the fourth quarter number is higher. Bob, you want to add some color to that? Okay. Thanks, Kyle. Holly, any other questions? In what terms? Is it box supply or... I know the contract runs through next year, and so I don't know the details in that regard. I would doubt there is a change of control clause. We can check on that and get back with you. But we're good through the end of next year. Again, right now, with what we're producing, we have a home for all of these tons in our own system. Now, the bigger opportunity with the capital investment at Jackson over the next say 24 months would be to address not only additional incremental productivity off the asset, but also a major cost reduction from the asset. So in that regard, we will continue to run to demand, if demand dictated that containerboard was not needed and paper was needed for the time being, we could make paper. So we haven't eliminated the capability of making paper on the machine at this time. It's just that the overwhelming demand for containerboard far outweighs the opportunities for paper. Thank you. Any other questions please? Go ahead, Mark. Good deal. All right. Operator, I think we're about out of time. Yes. I just want to thank everybody for joining us today and stay well, be safe and look forward to talking with you in the April call. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. For the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations of $271 million and free cash flow of $103 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $168 million; common stock dividends totaled $75 million, $51 million for federal and state income tax payments, and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the year with $975 million of cash on hand, or just over $1.1 billion including marketable securities. Our liquidity at December 31 was just under $1.5 billion. For the full year 2020, cash from operations was $1.03 billion. We had capital spending of $421 million. Free cash flow was $612 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2020 was 25%. And our final report at cash tax rate was 18%. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $500 million to $525 million, which excludes any potential capital spending related to the Jackson conversion, since that is still being evaluated, as Mark indicated earlier. DD&A is expected to be approximately $407 million. Pension and post-retirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million, which is net of a non-operating pension benefit of almost $20 million primarily due to our pension asset performance in 2020. We also expect to make cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $52 million. Based on the recent 27% increase to our dividend, we expect dividend payments for the year of $380 million. Our full year interest expense in 2021 is expected to be approximately $95 million and net cash interest payments should be about $93 million. No. I'd just say, George that from \u2013 bringing I guess some of the write-ups that have come out last night and so forth. But the impact from Jackson was probably what drove that difference that that people were noticing in the fourth quarter relative to the cost side on the packaging segment. Yes, George, I'd say that, just as we look from the fourth to the first similar to the comments that Mark made, freight costs, we expect those to stay high and actually move up a bit more. And as well as OCC costs, recycled fiber prices are moving up. Certainly, as we reset a new year, our fringes and benefits on our labor costs, as well as any increases in wage rates, that will be an impact as we move from the fourth to the first. And then also on a lot of outside services and materials supplies things of that nature, as a headwind as well. But to your point, outages \u2013 maintenance outages will be favorable moving as we move into the first quarter. Of course, the benefits will be on the \u2013 as Tom mentioned, the price realization that we've got a small piece of that in the fourth, but we expect the vast majority to come in the first quarter. I'm sorry, sequential it's probably $0.03 or $0.04 as we move into the first quarter, based on where we see prices going. It's just absolute demand. Tom? Hopefully that gives you an answer that you can digest. Yes. Anthony, I'll just add relative to the quarter. One thing to keep in mind as far as the results in the Paper segment, the volumes were about where we thought they would be. But one of the things that impacted paper was our outage costs that we had for the quarter, there's like $0.10 negative impact year-over-year in paper, packaging not \u2013 it was actually a slight positive, I believe. But that was a big hit on our paper results in the fourth quarter. No, just perfect."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for joining Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready. \nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.\n I'll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions.\n Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $139 million or $1.46 per share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2020 net income was $149 million or $1.57 per share compared to the third quarter 2019 net income of $182 million or $1.92 per share. Third quarter net sales were $1.69 billion in 2020 and $1.75 billion in 2019.\n Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding special items, was $323 million in 2020 and $364 million in 2019. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on our DeRidder Mill during the months of August and September. Bob will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Details of all the special items for the third quarter of 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. \n Excluding the special items, the $0.35 per share decrease in third quarter 2020 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.36 and Paper segment, $0.07, lower volumes in our paper segment of $0.33 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs $0.04 and higher freight expense, $0.02.\n These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.22, lower operating costs of $0.20, which were primarily from lower indirect costs at the idle Jackson Mill as well as lower indirect and fixed costs in our box plants.\n We also had lower converting costs of $0.04 and lower other costs of $0.01. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2020 of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million and sales of $1.5 billion and also a 22% margin. In the Packaging segment, demand was very strong throughout the quarter.\n And we set new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments and shipments per day. Our flexible containerboard mill system was able to overcome the Hurricane Laura related downtime at our DeRidder Mill and avoid any disruptions to customers. The mill was able to mitigate a portion of the downtime by postponing a previously scheduled outage during the quarter and other productivity gains. However, this unplanned downtime, combined with the extremely strong demand, resulted in an inventory drop of 55,000 tons during the quarter or 58,000 tons below last year's level.\n As a result, our weeks of supply at the end of the quarter was at an all-time low. We've decided to postpone the large planned discretionary fourth quarter outage at the DeRidder Mill that we had discussed on the last earnings call, in order to enable us to build inventory ahead of next year's annual outage schedule and the expected continued strong demand we're seeing.\n The mills did a great job of managing through the hurricane-induced production challenges to supply the record-breaking needs of our box plants and the efficiencies and cost improvement at the plants continued throughout the quarter.\n I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business. \nThomas Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments, up 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter as well as shipments per day, up 4.7% compared to last year. Through the first 3 quarters of 2020, our box shipment volume is up 4.4% in total and 3.3% on a per-day basis.\n Outside sales volume of containerboard was 28,000 tons below last year's third quarter as we ran our containerboard system to overcome the hurricane-related downtime at DeRidder and supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.34 per share below the third quarter of 2019 and up $0.05 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a favorable product and customer mix.\n Export containerboard prices were down $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019 and flat compared to the second quarter of 2020. Finally, we recently notified our containerboard customers of a $50 per ton price increase effective November 1. And in addition, we have also notified our box customers of a price increase. While we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize some of the benefits of the increase during the fourth quarter, but the vast majority of the benefit would be expected in the first quarter of 2020. I'll now turn it back to Mark. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Tom. Looking at our paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter was $17 million with sales of $178 million or a 9% margin compared to the third quarter of 2019 EBITDA of $58 million and sales of $243 million or 24% margin.\n Average prices and mix were about 5% below the third quarter of 2019 and about 1% below the second quarter of 2020. Although our seasonally stronger third quarter cut size and printing and converting volumes were about 45% higher than the second quarter levels, they were well below last year's levels by almost 24%. We had our Jackson Mill down for the entire third quarter to help manage our supply to these lower demand levels. We restarted paper production at the mill in early October, partly as a result of our demand outlook relative to our inventory levels as well as the scheduled outage at our International Falls Mill earlier this month. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and we'll run on our system accordingly.\n I'll now turn it over to Bob. \nRobert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. We had very good cash generation in the third quarter with cash provided by operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $196 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $102 million, common stock dividends totaled $75 million, pension payments of $71 million, $21 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $7 million.\n We ended the quarter with $949 million of cash on hand or just under $1.1 billion, including marketable securities. Our liquidity at September 30 was just over $1.4 billion. Regarding Hurricane Laura-related costs and expenses at our DeRidder Mill, based on the way our insurance coverages work for named storms such as this. There are separate deductibles for property damage and the time element or business interruption aspects of our coverage.\n The costs incurred over the months of August and September did not meet the deductibles for either of these, so there will not be an insurance claim filed for these damages and downtime, which together totaled just under $10 million. Finally, as Mark indicated, because of our extremely low containerboard inventory and expected continued strong demand, we postponed a scheduled third quarter machine outage at DeRidder, and we will postpone the mill's large planned discretionary fourth quarter outage that we mentioned on last quarter's call.\n As a result, our planned outage expense for the third quarter came in $0.04 per share lower than what we last discussed. And a revised estimate for the fourth quarter is now expected to be $0.23 per share or $0.11 per share higher a than the third quarter.\n This would put us at $0.66 per share in total for the full year 2020. We are currently assessing when to reschedule these outages as well as  the entire planned outage schedule for 2021, and we'll communicate that to you in January as we normally do.\n I'll now turn it back over to Mark. \nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. For 3 quarters now, our employees across the company ran their operations safely and in a cost-effective manner during the pandemic. They are doing an outstanding job in adhering to the processes and strict protocols we have instituted to help protect them and their families. What makes this even more remarkable is that our employees focus on these new work requirements is occurring while we are experiencing unprecedented demand within our packaging business, and they continue to successfully meet the expectations of our containerboard and box customers.\n Everyone has worked very hard to overcome the challenges and obstacles we face this year, and I couldn't be more proud of the entire organization as well as the strong partnerships we have with our customers and suppliers. Looking ahead, as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect corrugated products demand to remain strong. Although box shipments will be lower than the third quarter with 3 less shipping days, volumes should be higher than last year's record fourth quarter shipments. In early October, a second hurricane, Hurricane Delta, again, impacted operations at our DeRidder Mill by approximately 4 days and almost 8,000 tons, which further challenged our historically low inventory position.\n However, we expect higher containerboard production volume compared to the third quarter as we work towards building some inventory prior to year-end in preparation for the first quarter of 2021 scheduled maintenance outages and expected continued strong demand. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, the converted #3 machine at the Wallula Mill as well as the mill itself is currently running to its capacity. However, we do plan to get some additional volume during 2021 after we optimize the OCC plant capital project, we're currently finishing up and complete some reliability improvements.\n Therefore, to help bring our inventory back to an appropriate level by year-end, beginning in November, we will also be producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the #3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama Mill, in addition to any white paper needs. Most of you know, for some time that the Jackson mill has always been an option for us to address our strategic, integrated containerboard supply needs that's capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream converting demand.\n We've done numerous studies and estimates over the last few years, and with the depressed demand in the uncoated free sheet market for Jackson products, our integration rate consistently in the upper 90s percent range, our historically low inventory levels, and limited outside availability of the types of containerboard we need to run the mix our box plants require, now is the perfect time to do some trial work and learn some things relative to the studies we have performed.\n We're confident, however, of our ability to produce high-quality virgin craft containerboard for use in our box plants during this period. The #3 machine at Jackson is a great, very versatile machine and the mill infrastructure itself allows us the necessary flexibility and optionality to react appropriately to our containerboard and white paper needs during these fluid and dynamic times.\n Obviously, to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality, the future capital investments and process changes in a phased approach will be required, and we'll use this period to further refine our estimates and assumptions as well as our volume and capital spending plans for 2021.\n Continuing on, as Tom mentioned, we expect to begin realizing in the Pacific Northwest. As well as the display and high-end graphics business for the holiday period normally falls off during the quarter. In addition, we expect average export prices to move higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In our Paper segment, although demand during this period is well below historical levels, as schools and businesses have reopened, to some extent, volume has improved since the low point reached during the second quarter.\n However, we believe our sales volume in the fourth quarter will be lower than the seasonally stronger third quarter although with the scheduled outage we had at our International Falls Mill earlier this month, our Jackson Mill was restarted on October 6. Beginning sometime in early November, the mill will be in a position to begin producing an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain the optimal inventory levels and service our customers require as well as begin the trials and production of containerboard that I just referred to.\n We also expect freight costs to be higher and with anticipated colder weather, energy costs should be higher as well. And finally, as Bob mentioned, scheduled maintenance outage cost should be about $0.11 per share higher than the third quarter. As certain areas of the economy continue to reopen, shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are expected to continue changing across the country, especially considering the upcoming colder weather and holiday gatherings.\n There continues to be numerous events and actions that could impact our expectations for the upcoming quarter and the operation of not only our facilities but also adversely impacting the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on from our suppliers. As a result, we are still not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the fourth quarter. And with that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involved inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual reports could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.\n And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Go ahead. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n George Staphos with Bank of America. \nGeorge Staphos: Mark, I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color on Jackson, recognizing it's a bit fluid. One, should we take away from this that you're still determining whether you will ultimately convert the third paper machine or PM3 at Jackson or you're going to keep this -- there's a chance that you could keep this as a flex machine that can run uncoated? \nMark Kowlzan: I think as we look at the paper machine at Jackson and the mill in general, you have to keep in mind that for 8 years now, we've not only thought about this, but we've worked towards enhancing the capability of the mill and its flexibility. We would run the mill to supply both our white paper needs and our containerboard needs as such. We believe where we are currently, we're in a good place to do that. The costs that you talk about, it's truly the fact that we will have higher input costs in terms of production of containerboard on that machine. The mill obviously, is not fully configured as you would think about integrated containerboard mill to run high capa at the speeds to get the big tonnage out. But nevertheless we can produce a good quality sheet. And at the same time, maintain the flexibility of the mill to provide our paper customers what is required. And it gives us a chance to see what and how long this pandemic plays out. And then at the end of this pandemic, what the paper demand will ultimately look like. So it's an elegant way for us to understand the capability of Jackson long term, while at the same time, understanding how we need to supply our paper business short-term and long term. With that, Bob, do you have anything on the cost side? George, does that satisfy that? \nGeorge Staphos: Yes, I guess. I mean, there's no way to quantify what the trialing and further understanding might cost you? Or given all the work you've done in the last 8 years, it wouldn't be worth calling out. \nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, for anybody that knows us, you would have to believe we have done an awful lot of work with our annual maintenance work, with the annual upgrades that we do to bolster and beef up the capability of the infrastructure. That being said, we're -- we have a lot of knowledge in this arena. And as far as the cost, there should not be a great deal of cost in terms of the trialing. But again, I would expect us to be able to get on grade rather quickly and produce a very high-quality sheet, albeit at lower normal production rates than you would see at our conventional containerboard virgin mills. \nGeorge Staphos: Okay. The next question is around the movement of the maintenance, the discretionary outage that you're planning for the fourth quarter. How that would likely come into results in 2021, I assume it would be in 2Q? And I know you didn't really want to guide too much for the fourth quarter or you don't want to quantify, but can you give us some of the larger buckets we should consider? I mean, you're starting at $1.57 entering the quarter from 3Q, the deferred outage based on your numbers in the past should add $0.30.\n Then you have seasonal factors and some of the other factors. Is there any way to quantify what some of those larger buckets would be or as we sit here, kind of a range between 2Q and 3Q seems reasonable, but any thoughts on that would be helpful. And then my last one would be any quick thoughts on how volumes are starting in the quarter. \nRobert Mundy: George, just looking at 3Q to 4Q and starting -- I'm not sure what you have in your model. But as we've said, the outages will be higher by $0.11 from third quarter. And we referred to freight costs. I think if you compare it to our -- the last 2 or 3 years relative to 3Q to 4Q, I would expect our freight cost to be higher than what it has been historically. Energy may be a little bit higher, where demand is in the Packaging segment, as we head into a holiday season, the overtime requirements because of the strong demand, labor benefits costs would be a little bit higher than normal.\n And as Mark referred to, it's running Jackson, running white and brown. And then as we do some of the work that we plan to do to improve the linerboard that we'll be running there, there will be some cost hiccups. So we certainly have something in there for that as we sort of do these -- do this work and make this linerboard in the fourth quarter that -- so you have some cost in some of the variable areas that you normally wouldn't see going from 3Q to 4Q. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. \nMark Wilde: I wondered, Mark, if either you or Tom could just talk a little bit about what has changed so dramatically in the last 3 months on the demand side of the industry? I mean, if we go back to July, you talked in your second quarter release about running the demand. One of your bigger competitors took nearly 1 million ton mill in Oregon out in mid-July, extensively for kind of market downtime. And all of a sudden, we're in a situation where lots of people are saying, this is the tightest market in 25 years. So what's driving this from your perspective? Where is the incremental demand really coming from? \nMark Kowlzan: I'm going to have Tom start that answer off by answering George's last question and then getting into yours, Tom, why don't you talk about the volume and then get that? \nThomas Hassfurther: Well, first of all, Mark, let me just tell you, our volume through 16 days this month is trending up 15%. Did you hear that number? 15%... \nMark Wilde: Yes, I heard that number. \nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. All right. Yes, because I have to remind myself of that number occasionally, trust me. \nMark Wilde: Yes, you're not the only guys throwing that kind of number around, Tom. \nThomas Hassfurther: Yes. Yes. And let me tell you something. When you dig in and you review the segments that are up, I mean, it's virtually every segment across the board is up significantly. Now you had -- as we talked about in the previous call, the foodservice side of the business was down dramatically. It was down almost 80% in some cases. And that's recovered quite a bit, but still not nearly where it was in the past. So we still have an opportunity there in that segment.\n Now if you look anecdotally and say, why is this demand like it is, I think one of the key elements to this is, is that you've got consumers that are not spending their discretionary monies on travel, entertainment, things like this, movies and all these other sorts of things, they traditionally would have and I think they're spending on a lot of products that actually come in boxes. And it's -- whether it's home improvement or whatever the case might be, then, of course, you've got that e-commerce segment, which is obviously up significantly as well. So that's the best description I can give you at this point in time. I really have no other explanation for it other than -- and I think you've also got a situation -- I'll just add that our customers tell us their inventory levels are desperately low as well. We're telling you the same thing about our containerboard. And they're looking to try to replenish that, and at the same time, trying to satisfy very, very strong demand. Hope that helps, Mark. \nMark Wilde: Your backlog for a box customer look like right now? \nThomas Hassfurther: I'm sorry, you didn't come through clearly. \nMark Wilde: Yes. What would your backlogs for a box customer look like right now? In other words, somebody comes into you with new volume, how long is that going to take to fill? Because I've been hearing numbers out the kind of 3, 4, 5 weeks. \nThomas Hassfurther: Well, yes, I mean, we're not -- we'll satisfy our customers based on what they need. I mean we've got a very, very flexible system that we've set up. And we don't really talk about ultra-long lead times or anything like that. But I can tell you that when you look out and you say, how far out is the demand and that sort of stuff, I mean, our trend going into November is much like what I'm talking about in terms of demand that we have in October.\n So -- and this of course ties in directly to the discussion we just had regarding the Jackson Mill. We can't buy any containerboard out in the open market, that's impossible to do. And this high demand level, this is the perfect time to trial Jackson and put some brown into our system. And I would also say, again, as Mark alluded to, we've planned this for a long time. We knew this day would come. And our track record demonstrates that PCA takes care of itself. And we we're committed to being fully integrated. And this is just yet another example, and we're not going to do it until the market demands it. \nMark Wilde: Yes. Okay. Mark, for people who aren't familiar with that Jackson Mill, can you just help us? I think there are 2 machines. There is the #3, the machine that they put in, in the late '90s? Or is it the smaller machine down there? \nMark Kowlzan: No, the number machine is the big machine from the 1990s. It's about 365 inches wide. It's a big, high speed, modern machine, lots of capability. Quite frankly, we've always spoken in terms of relative quality of machine. The machines at DeRidder were good machines, machine out of Wallula that we converted, the #3 was a better machine than what we converted at DeRidder. But quite frankly, this Jackson machine's a better machine than all of those put together. \nMark Wilde: Okay. Just finally on Jackson. Would it be possible to think about kind of making that a white top mill over time? The market seems to be moving toward white top. I don't think you produce any right now. \nMark Kowlzan: It has that capability if we determine that, that would -- made sense to us. Obviously, the machine that we're willing to think about it. White top, you would have to put a top sheet on with a mini fourdrinier. But in capital spending and upgrades to a machine that was going to be permanently converted in the future years, you would more than likely put many fourdrinier on that machine that can handle brown or a bleached fiber. And then the machine currently has a size press, so you wouldn't have to add a size press, so it just determines in terms of where we believe, where we need to take that mill and what's the demand look like. So there's lots and lots of opportunity.\n Next question, please? \nOperator: Mark Connelly with Stephens. \nMark Connelly: Two questions. You obviously have a reputation for being service-intensive and flexible. But I'm curious, as this volume expands, is your mix moving away from value-add orders more towards regular orders? And do you see that as a permanent shift if it is happening? \nThomas Hassfurther: Mark, I don't see that shift happening. As I mentioned before, I mean, virtually in every segment of our business, I mean, we're up significantly. So I think our customer base has remained very much the same. Obviously, we continue to grow our business and first of all, grow with our existing customers. But no, I think part of our service flexibility is a driver of our growth as well. So I don't see it changing significantly. \nMark Connelly: Okay, super. And just one more question. You've talked about the dramatically increased flexibility of your newer machine at Wallula, at DeRidder. Is there a productivity lag that comes with that increased flexibility? Or do you get the flexibility without those lags? \nMark Kowlzan: You pretty much get the flexibility without the lags. Next question, please? \nOperator: Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. \nBrian Maguire: Just a couple more just on the paper segment and Jackson in general. Just in the last couple of months when you weren't running Jackson and you were just running International Falls. Obviously, not probably the best environment for demand in paper. But just wondering if you were able to provide the variety of paper to your customers and service them and have you had any feedback from customers on the quality of the paper you were producing there versus what they were getting at Jackson? Any kind of issues with kind of eventually transitioning to just a 1 mill system in paper? \nMark Kowlzan: No. Keep in mind, I Falls and Jackson have supplied the marketplace. With cut size as an example, we -- it's the same product. We also have the ability, and we've had that for years at eye falls on the smaller machine to produce color grades. And so we were producing a few of the color grades during this period of time, but also just running out of inventory. A little more pointedly to answer your question, I Falls ultimately has the ability to supply our current customer portfolio if, in fact, that's all that was required in terms of future demand destruction.\n But that remains to be determined where we end up with that. But I Falls is a very versatile capable mill. \nBrian Maguire: Okay. And then just -- I think this question has kind of been asked a little bit already, but just maybe more directly, is there a capacity number or tonnage you could estimate for how much linerboard you would be able to produce on the #3 machine if you decided to run it full out? I mean, I guess the trialing is part and parcel to that, but is there an expectation of what you might be able to get to, if all goes well? \nMark Kowlzan: No. We'll update you in January. We have some numbers in the back of our mind that we think we're capable of, but I don't want to put that out until we prove it ourselves. And then as time goes on, you would have to imagine a mill the size of Jackson with the appropriate level of capital has a tremendous opportunity to supply just about anything that the Packaging side of the business needs for the foreseeable future. If growth demands that. So we've got lots of optionality in that regard, and we'll play it out that way. \nBrian Maguire: Okay. And just last one for me. Just with the really strong demand we're seeing and the need to kind of add a little bit more paper supply. How is the utilization at the box plant level going? Do you foresee having to add any more capacity to the box plants? Or is there enough -- should just be able to add shifts to existing operations to meet the demand? \nThomas Hassfurther: Brian, this is Tom. Fortunately, we have consistently invested in our box plants over the years. Given how our customers drive our business. And so we're -- I mean we're stretched. There's no question. I mean we're incredibly busy. I mean, you don't just all of a sudden take these kind of surge demands and be able to roll it out. Again, I'll go back and I do want to mention that our employees have done an unbelievable job during this COVID pandemic as Mark mentioned earlier. And to be able to satisfy these kind of demand levels with this going on at the same time is just absolutely remarkable. We'll continue to invest. We're positioned to do so. We've got projects rolling on all the time. And of course, it's how we run our business. We run our business based on what our customers want, and that factors all the way back to the mill level. So you see that's why, again, as we mentioned, that it's so important that we get some output out of Jackson just to replenish some inventory and to keep our customers supplied with boxes. \nOperator: Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. \nGabe Hajde: The first one, I guess, with the delaying the optional, I guess, DeRidder work that you're looking to do, I'm assuming that goes into next year. Has anything changed on the CapEx side of the equation for this year since you're targeting $400 million? \nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, we're still right in that ballpark. \nGabe Hajde: Okay. And then as it relates to containerboard inventories, I mean, I think -- I don't know, by my math, maybe you have to restore 55,000 to 65,000 tons this quarter, and that would maybe aid in fixed overhead absorption by about $15 million. Is there -- I don't know, Bob, can you help us with that? \nRobert Mundy: No. I think you're right, Gabe, I think you're in the right ballpark, and that certainly will help in -- with our cost absorption in the quarter as we increase production to get our inventories up. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please? \nOperator: Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. \nMark Weintraub: On Jackson understanding premature to give us where the mill gets to potentially. But obviously, you need paper now to the extent you can. Is there any color you can provide in terms of short-term capability? And I know if it's -- at the same time, in the past, you've talked about the ability to expand at Wallula with some incremental capital. Is that something that's also on the table and being considered? \nMark Kowlzan: Let me -- a little bit to help quantify that question. If you recall, when we started this process at Wallula almost 4 years ago, and we -- and then we took the machine brown without all of the benefits of the major capital. We called out we expected, they'll produce probably about 700 tons a day of a good craft linerboard on that machine at Wallula. And don't forget the Wallula machines is a narrower machine. It's almost 100 inches narrower. The machine at Jackson is wider. But quite frankly, we're hoping in the same relative terms to be able to produce that type of volume, 700 or 800 tons a day of production. But again, that remains to be seen.\n The challenge is on the folks at the mill and our technology organization over the upcoming weeks. But theoretically, that machine has that kind of capability currently. And then it's -- as far as its future capability, it's just capital dependent. \nMark Weintraub: Great. And the potential to do something incremental at Wallula, is that still something to be considered? \nMark Kowlzan: Well, not in a big way. We know that we've got some opportunity with the OCC plant. We'll be starting that up after the first of the year. We'll be finalizing the actual project work as we wrap up this fourth quarter. And then getting ready to start it up. That will lend itself to a benefit in terms of fiber furnish makeup and drainage, pressing, drying capabilities, quality characteristics.\n And then also, we've had some ongoing project work on #2 machine at Wallula. That's a smaller machine. But as of next year, we'll be adding a new head box and new wetting capability, we'll see tremendous more reliability and quality benefits from this work. So incrementally, we'll see improvements. But as we've always said, Wallula Mill, on a run rate basis, was probably going to be around 600,000 tons a year. And we're there. As of this past summer, we've been running the mill depending on grade mix, right at that run rate tonnage on an annual basis of about 600,000 tons a year. And we're very pleased with that. \nMark Weintraub: Great. And one last quick one, if I could. The costs -- or I think you talked about the indirect costs at Jackson being lower in the third quarter than the second quarter. Was there still much in the way of costs related to Jackson? Or were we getting a relatively clean look at what the white paper system does, ex-Jackson? I imagine there were still some costs related to Jackson. \nRobert Mundy: No. Yes, Mark. Obviously, the -- your fixed costs are fixed. Whether you're producing or not, you have a substantial amount of cost there and of course, a portion of your indirects as well. So I would say that's not a good clean look as you were referring to of a 1 mill paper system. \nMark Weintraub: Okay. Any chance of getting additional color on that or... \nRobert Mundy: No. I think that's -- I'm not going to quantify that for you, but that is -- it will improve somewhat in the fourth quarter because we did run Jackson or we are running Jackson rather as we speak. But you still will -- it's -- we're not going to quantify right now, I guess, what the what a 1 mill system would look like from a cost perspective. But maybe next year, sometime as things unfold relative to packaging demand and our paper demand as well. \nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please. \nOperator: Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. \nAdam Josephson: Mark, back to Jackson, if you assume that white paper demand stays at roughly these levels, maybe it bounces a little bit next year, just given how much it's fallen this year. But if it stays at roughly these levels, do you envision needing to produce much paper at that mill next year? And if not, then what do you think the containerboard/white paper mix could look like at that point or if not next year, then once you fully configure the machine to produce containerboard? \nMark Kowlzan: Yes. If you assume that the pandemic-related impacts continue on through next year, we would anticipate about 50% production of white paper coming out of the mill, which would then allow us the flexibility to take care of some extra brown linerboard for the system. So -- but we would expect about 50% white paper coming out of that mill to support our anticipated customer demands. \nAdam Josephson: Which would result in roughly how much containerboard production Mark? \nMark Kowlzan: I'm not going to -- we'll talk more in January after we've had the 3 months under our belt and can really give you some hard numbers and a little bit better conviction on what we see. \nAdam Josephson: Sure. No, understood. Tom, following up on Mark's question -- Wilde's question earlier, just about the abrupt change in demand patterns from last quarter to this quarter. What is your visibility like just, not just right now, but in general. How much visibility into future box demand do you generally have at a point in time? And so 3 months ago, did you have any idea this was coming? Presumably not. And so if you didn't, what gives you confidence that you will -- 3 months from now, demand will be at -- if not these levels then still very robust? I'm just trying to understand, just walk us through what your visibility is? \nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. Adam, let's go back 3 months ago, first. And the -- we had little visibility because nobody knew where the pandemic was really headed. Other than the fact that the economy was going to continue to open up. And depending on what happened in these various states and how fast they open and those sorts of things, that helped drive some of this demand level. I think, in addition, because it hits so quickly and so fast and because of the way our customers were running their business, inventory levels, as I said, both for us and our business and our customers got dramatically low. And so as this demand is going up, there's actually 2 forms of demand that are taking place.\n One is, is to satisfy the end consumer, but also to build inventory of some sort. And so it's almost a little like pushing water uphill to some extent. So I think that what we'll see is we'll see -- we'll go through this. And as those inventory levels do become a little more manageable, this surge is going to slow down to some extent, at least that's what we think. And -- but it's still going to be, but it's still going to be positive. And this is -- right now, it's very positive for the box business, and I expect it to remain so. In talking to customers and kind of getting their forecast and what they think is coming forward, which is what really drives our business, I would say that the -- it's a very positive attitude right now, positive outlook. And they want suppliers who can really adapt to their demands as well. So I think it's very positive going forward. \nAdam Josephson: I appreciate it. And just one last one for Mark or Bob, on guidance. So obviously, you're quite confident on box demand heading into next year, but there are a number of uncertainties. Can you just kind of walk us through your hesitation in giving current quarter guidance, given that you're pretty much a month into the quarter? And then just more broadly, does this experience change your thought process about giving any sort of guidance? In other words, if it's this unclear, if it's been this unclear for 3 straight quarters, is there any compelling reason to give quarterly guidance thereafter? \nRobert Mundy: Well, Adam, I guess the -- if you look at what our internal numbers were for the last 3 quarters, counting the third versus where we ended up, we were off. I'm not going to say whether we were better or worse. But -- and if we had put those numbers out there, it would have been a lot of discussion around why we didn't come closer to our guidance. And just for the same reasons we've said every call and what Mark said in today's call, it's -- and Tom's comments around the demand and where that went to. It's just too -- things are too fluid.\n And when you look at the fourth quarter of this year, especially with how we're going to be running Jackson, there's a lot of assumptions in there about our containerboard production as well as our paper needs. And depending on how that swings, it can move your cost wildly. And it's just another reason that -- another added degree of uncertainty relative to providing fourth quarter guidance. \nAdam Josephson: Bob -- and just beyond, I mean, is there a compelling reason to give guidance period? \nRobert Mundy: That's something we'll say for another day, Adam. That's not -- that's -- what we've done historically is working well for us. These are unusual times, which is why we've taken a pause relative to what we've done historically. And when things get normalized, whatever that means, we'll evaluate that as far as how we do it going forward. \nMark Kowlzan: Next questoin, please. \nOperator: Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. \nNeel Kumar: Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of box demand for the holiday e-commerce season? It seems that retailers are trying to have an earlier and more evenly spread out holiday season. So are you seeing any evidence of that so far, given your strong October volumes? \nThomas Hassfurther: I'll just respond real quick, Neel. E-commerce and the holiday and et cetera, is up dramatically. And the forecast is it's going to be incredibly busy all the way through. The limitation, I think, on the holiday season for e-commerce is going to be getting the product to the consumer. You've heard FedEx, you've heard UPS both say that they're basically maxed out for the season. And that's why they're encouraging people to get their holiday deliveries earlier than normal. \nNeel Kumar: Great. That's helpful. And then you referenced expecting a less rich mix in corrugated products in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Can you just provide some more color on what's driving that and the pension magnitude? \nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, that's primarily around our graphics business, our point of purchase displays and other graphics business. That tails off quite dramatically in the fourth quarter. That's all done primarily throughout the year for the various holidays. And of course, Christmas is a big holiday, and that's already been delivered. So that just tends to drop off and then that begins to come back in and it's strongest in the second and third quarters. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question. \nOperator: Anthony Pettinari with Citi. \nAnthony Pettinari: Tom, just circling back to Mark's earlier question, is it accurate to say that -- is it your expectation that Jackson will keep you from buying board externally in 4Q and maybe '21 as well? Or is there some risk that if demand is stronger than expected or based on the results of the trial that you would have to buy externally? How much of a risk is that potentially? And are you -- kind of related question, are you exploring other capacity options outside of what you've outlined at Jackson and Wallula to mitigate that risk? \nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. Anthony, fortunately, because of the work we've done at Jackson leading up to this, I've got a high degree of confidence that this is going to turn out to be very good for us, and we'll continue to be able to supply us in our box system. And the reason -- one of -- and as I mentioned earlier, I said one of the reasons we have to do this, this is really our only option. There's not board to be bought on the outside market right now.\n I mean everybody is incredibly busy and it is unbelievably tight. So we're going to have to do what we plan to do in Jackson in order to keep our box plant supplied. That's just -- and that's simply driven by the demand we have right now. \nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And then just trying to understand that 15% growth you're seeing. Obviously, it's been a big increase in COVID cases heading into colder weather. I'm just wondering, when you talk to your customers, especially on the CPG or grocery side, is there any early indication that they're seeing consumer stockpiling, like what we saw in March and April? Or has that been a part of customer conversations? \nThomas Hassfurther: No, I don't -- we're not seeing anything like the stockpiling that we saw at the beginning of COVID, no. \nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. And then just quick last one, if I could. On DeRidder, I'm wondering if you could talk about Laura and Delta's impact on the fiber basket around that mill. And in terms of elevated fiber cost and availability, is that something that is sort of largely dissipated in 4Q? Or how long-lived could that be given what looked like pretty extensive damage to the timberlands around there? \nMark Kowlzan: Well, quite honestly, whenever you see a hurricane like this, because of all the damaged trees, there's a glut of wood available. You just have to get the producers into the woods to get the wood out to the mill. So the landowners and the producers have to get the wood out in a timely manner before it starts rotting and decaying in the woods.\n So besides -- for a short period of time, the impact of localized flooding, longer term, I don't expect to see any big impact on the fiber supply, fiber cost to the mill.\n Next question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\n George Staphos with Bank of America. \nGeorge Staphos: I didn't take the analysis back more than a few years, but it certainly looks like your inventories are kind of the lowest they've been since 2017.  Could you confirm or correct that view? And is this an all-time record low inventory for you? Just some thoughts or guardrails that you could provide us on that would be appreciated. And then a question for Tom. It's come up in different ways on the call so far. A lot of the questions that investors seem to have on containerboard and corrugate is, hey, look, when this is all over, whatever that might mean, and we stop ordering for direct-to-consumer. Ultimately, the box volumes will normalize as we all go back out to movie theaters and restaurants and the like. What level of permanent -- I mean that's one view. \n I mean, what permanent level of consumption do you think has now been built into the corrugated market? Because we've learned new behaviors, right? We're ordering more at home. That's convenient. That behavior might stay going forward. What have you seen so far from what your customers are saying on that or any work that you've done on the consumer side in terms of what the new embedded amount of volume in corrugated is because of what we've gone through. \nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. I'll take the -- George, this is Tom. I'll first talk to you about this -- what this normalized demand is. One of the reasons we're not giving any forecast because we don't know what that normalized demand is, quite frankly, okay? \n I think if you if you look back and you say, well, what has the average been so far this year prior to October? I would have said at a given point in time, might have said, well, maybe that's probably more indicative of what the average is going to be. But now we've had this huge spike again. So it's very unpredictable at the moment. And I think our customers are very much in the same boat. They're in a very reactionary mode right now.\n I think there are a lot of different moving parts here. Not only consumer demand and COVID, but we've also got a Presidential Election, And we may have administration changes, whatever the case might be. There's just a lot of big ifs out there. And we're just going to have to wait and see what that is. The only thing I can tell you is that we're on a positive -- we're on a very positive trajectory, and I think that will continue. \nRobert Mundy: And George, regarding your I'm sorry, regarding your inventory question, I went back as far as 2013, and these are from a supply -- available supply standpoint, we're lower than we were back then. And I didn't go back any further because, obviously, that's sort of when the transformation of the company occurred with the Boise acquisition. So yes, these are historically low levels of inventory. \nGeorge Staphos: Tom, without putting a number on it, are your customers of the view that corrugated demand has been permanently benefited by what we've gone through or even that's too hard to discern at this time? And if that's the case, totally understand. Just want to try it one more time. \nThomas Hassfurther: Yes. I think that's just too hard to discern at this point in time. \nMark Kowlzan: I think we've got time for -- go ahead. \nOperator: Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. \nMark Wilde: Two quick follow-ons. One, I wonder if we could just get some comment on the cash position of the company. I mean, $1.1 billion with the marketable securities is a pretty impressive war chest. And I just wonder about the need to maintain such a big position if we're at the front-end of a cyclical upturn.\n And then the other question I had is for Tom Hassfurther, and that's just whether there's any portion of the corrugated market, that you think may be moving away from a reliance on kind of pulp and paper as the escalator de-escalator. I think particularly there about some of these big e-commerce firms and whether they're striking different deals? \nMark Kowlzan: Let me answer the cash question. I think we went back to the first quarter, a similar question. And I think I answered and I said I wasn't concerned about the level of cash and we were basically in very uncertain times.\n But I think I said at the time that I would let you know when I thought we had too much cash. And I still have that same position that we are still living in very uncertain times. And I'll let you know when we have too much cash. \nThomas Hassfurther: And Mark, I would say that I'm still not interested in stepping on landmines. So I'm really not going to even discuss anything regarding pulp and paper. And of course, any agreements we have with our customers are between us and our customers. And we don't publicly disclose those. So although I'd like to give you a little more clear answer to your question, I really can't at this time. \nMark Kowlzan: Operator, I believe we're out of time. \nOperator: Do you have any closing comments, Mr. Kowlzan? \nMark Kowlzan: Yes, everyone, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of January. Stay safe, stay well. Have a nice holiday. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, our corrugated products plants established new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments, up 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter as well as shipments per day, up 4.7% compared to last year. Through the first 3 quarters of 2020, our box shipment volume is up 4.4% in total and 3.3% on a per-day basis.\n Outside sales volume of containerboard was 28,000 tons below last year's third quarter as we ran our containerboard system to overcome the hurricane-related downtime at DeRidder and supply the record needs of our box plants. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.34 per share below the third quarter of 2019 and up $0.05 per share compared to the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to a favorable product and customer mix.\n Export containerboard prices were down $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019 and flat compared to the second quarter of 2020. Finally, we recently notified our containerboard customers of a $50 per ton price increase effective November 1. And in addition, we have also notified our box customers of a price increase. While we don't comment on forward pricing specifics, we would expect to realize some of the benefits of the increase during the fourth quarter, but the vast majority of the benefit would be expected in the first quarter of 2020. I'll now turn it back to Mark. Well, first of all, Mark, let me just tell you, our volume through 16 days this month is trending up 15%. Did you hear that number? 15%... Okay. All right. Yes, because I have to remind myself of that number occasionally, trust me. Yes. Yes. And let me tell you something. When you dig in and you review the segments that are up, I mean, it's virtually every segment across the board is up significantly. Now you had -- as we talked about in the previous call, the foodservice side of the business was down dramatically. It was down almost 80% in some cases. And that's recovered quite a bit, but still not nearly where it was in the past. So we still have an opportunity there in that segment.\n Now if you look anecdotally and say, why is this demand like it is, I think one of the key elements to this is, is that you've got consumers that are not spending their discretionary monies on travel, entertainment, things like this, movies and all these other sorts of things, they traditionally would have and I think they're spending on a lot of products that actually come in boxes. And it's -- whether it's home improvement or whatever the case might be, then, of course, you've got that e-commerce segment, which is obviously up significantly as well. So that's the best description I can give you at this point in time. I really have no other explanation for it other than -- and I think you've also got a situation -- I'll just add that our customers tell us their inventory levels are desperately low as well. We're telling you the same thing about our containerboard. And they're looking to try to replenish that, and at the same time, trying to satisfy very, very strong demand. Hope that helps, Mark. I'm sorry, you didn't come through clearly. Well, yes, I mean, we're not -- we'll satisfy our customers based on what they need. I mean we've got a very, very flexible system that we've set up. And we don't really talk about ultra-long lead times or anything like that. But I can tell you that when you look out and you say, how far out is the demand and that sort of stuff, I mean, our trend going into November is much like what I'm talking about in terms of demand that we have in October.\n So -- and this of course ties in directly to the discussion we just had regarding the Jackson Mill. We can't buy any containerboard out in the open market, that's impossible to do. And this high demand level, this is the perfect time to trial Jackson and put some brown into our system. And I would also say, again, as Mark alluded to, we've planned this for a long time. We knew this day would come. And our track record demonstrates that PCA takes care of itself. And we we're committed to being fully integrated. And this is just yet another example, and we're not going to do it until the market demands it. Mark, I don't see that shift happening. As I mentioned before, I mean, virtually in every segment of our business, I mean, we're up significantly. So I think our customer base has remained very much the same. Obviously, we continue to grow our business and first of all, grow with our existing customers. But no, I think part of our service flexibility is a driver of our growth as well. So I don't see it changing significantly. Brian, this is Tom. Fortunately, we have consistently invested in our box plants over the years. Given how our customers drive our business. And so we're -- I mean we're stretched. There's no question. I mean we're incredibly busy. I mean, you don't just all of a sudden take these kind of surge demands and be able to roll it out. Again, I'll go back and I do want to mention that our employees have done an unbelievable job during this COVID pandemic as Mark mentioned earlier. And to be able to satisfy these kind of demand levels with this going on at the same time is just absolutely remarkable. We'll continue to invest. We're positioned to do so. We've got projects rolling on all the time. And of course, it's how we run our business. We run our business based on what our customers want, and that factors all the way back to the mill level. So you see that's why, again, as we mentioned, that it's so important that we get some output out of Jackson just to replenish some inventory and to keep our customers supplied with boxes. Yes, we're still right in that ballpark. Okay. Adam, let's go back 3 months ago, first. And the -- we had little visibility because nobody knew where the pandemic was really headed. Other than the fact that the economy was going to continue to open up. And depending on what happened in these various states and how fast they open and those sorts of things, that helped drive some of this demand level. I think, in addition, because it hits so quickly and so fast and because of the way our customers were running their business, inventory levels, as I said, both for us and our business and our customers got dramatically low. And so as this demand is going up, there's actually 2 forms of demand that are taking place.\n One is, is to satisfy the end consumer, but also to build inventory of some sort. And so it's almost a little like pushing water uphill to some extent. So I think that what we'll see is we'll see -- we'll go through this. And as those inventory levels do become a little more manageable, this surge is going to slow down to some extent, at least that's what we think. And -- but it's still going to be, but it's still going to be positive. And this is -- right now, it's very positive for the box business, and I expect it to remain so. In talking to customers and kind of getting their forecast and what they think is coming forward, which is what really drives our business, I would say that the -- it's a very positive attitude right now, positive outlook. And they want suppliers who can really adapt to their demands as well. So I think it's very positive going forward. I'll just respond real quick, Neel. E-commerce and the holiday and et cetera, is up dramatically. And the forecast is it's going to be incredibly busy all the way through. The limitation, I think, on the holiday season for e-commerce is going to be getting the product to the consumer. You've heard FedEx, you've heard UPS both say that they're basically maxed out for the season. And that's why they're encouraging people to get their holiday deliveries earlier than normal. Yes, that's primarily around our graphics business, our point of purchase displays and other graphics business. That tails off quite dramatically in the fourth quarter. That's all done primarily throughout the year for the various holidays. And of course, Christmas is a big holiday, and that's already been delivered. So that just tends to drop off and then that begins to come back in and it's strongest in the second and third quarters. Okay. Anthony, fortunately, because of the work we've done at Jackson leading up to this, I've got a high degree of confidence that this is going to turn out to be very good for us, and we'll continue to be able to supply us in our box system. And the reason -- one of -- and as I mentioned earlier, I said one of the reasons we have to do this, this is really our only option. There's not board to be bought on the outside market right now.\n I mean everybody is incredibly busy and it is unbelievably tight. So we're going to have to do what we plan to do in Jackson in order to keep our box plant supplied. That's just -- and that's simply driven by the demand we have right now. No, I don't -- we're not seeing anything like the stockpiling that we saw at the beginning of COVID, no. Okay. I'll take the -- George, this is Tom. I'll first talk to you about this -- what this normalized demand is. One of the reasons we're not giving any forecast because we don't know what that normalized demand is, quite frankly, okay? \n I think if you if you look back and you say, well, what has the average been so far this year prior to October? I would have said at a given point in time, might have said, well, maybe that's probably more indicative of what the average is going to be. But now we've had this huge spike again. So it's very unpredictable at the moment. And I think our customers are very much in the same boat. They're in a very reactionary mode right now.\n I think there are a lot of different moving parts here. Not only consumer demand and COVID, but we've also got a Presidential Election, And we may have administration changes, whatever the case might be. There's just a lot of big ifs out there. And we're just going to have to wait and see what that is. The only thing I can tell you is that we're on a positive -- we're on a very positive trajectory, and I think that will continue. Yes. I think that's just too hard to discern at this point in time. And Mark, I would say that I'm still not interested in stepping on landmines. So I'm really not going to even discuss anything regarding pulp and paper. And of course, any agreements we have with our customers are between us and our customers. And we don't publicly disclose those. So although I'd like to give you a little more clear answer to your question, I really can't at this time."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.\n I'll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions.\n Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $139 million or $1.46 per share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2020 net income was $149 million or $1.57 per share compared to the third quarter 2019 net income of $182 million or $1.92 per share. Third quarter net sales were $1.69 billion in 2020 and $1.75 billion in 2019.\n Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding special items, was $323 million in 2020 and $364 million in 2019. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on our DeRidder Mill during the months of August and September. Bob will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Details of all the special items for the third quarter of 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. \n Excluding the special items, the $0.35 per share decrease in third quarter 2020 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.36 and Paper segment, $0.07, lower volumes in our paper segment of $0.33 and higher scheduled maintenance outage costs $0.04 and higher freight expense, $0.02.\n These items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.22, lower operating costs of $0.20, which were primarily from lower indirect costs at the idle Jackson Mill as well as lower indirect and fixed costs in our box plants.\n We also had lower converting costs of $0.04 and lower other costs of $0.01. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2020 of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million and sales of $1.5 billion and also a 22% margin. In the Packaging segment, demand was very strong throughout the quarter.\n And we set new all-time quarterly records for total box shipments and shipments per day. Our flexible containerboard mill system was able to overcome the Hurricane Laura related downtime at our DeRidder Mill and avoid any disruptions to customers. The mill was able to mitigate a portion of the downtime by postponing a previously scheduled outage during the quarter and other productivity gains. However, this unplanned downtime, combined with the extremely strong demand, resulted in an inventory drop of 55,000 tons during the quarter or 58,000 tons below last year's level.\n As a result, our weeks of supply at the end of the quarter was at an all-time low. We've decided to postpone the large planned discretionary fourth quarter outage at the DeRidder Mill that we had discussed on the last earnings call, in order to enable us to build inventory ahead of next year's annual outage schedule and the expected continued strong demand we're seeing.\n The mills did a great job of managing through the hurricane-induced production challenges to supply the record-breaking needs of our box plants and the efficiencies and cost improvement at the plants continued throughout the quarter.\n I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide more details on containerboard sales and our corrugated business. Thank you, Tom. Looking at our paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter was $17 million with sales of $178 million or a 9% margin compared to the third quarter of 2019 EBITDA of $58 million and sales of $243 million or 24% margin.\n Average prices and mix were about 5% below the third quarter of 2019 and about 1% below the second quarter of 2020. Although our seasonally stronger third quarter cut size and printing and converting volumes were about 45% higher than the second quarter levels, they were well below last year's levels by almost 24%. We had our Jackson Mill down for the entire third quarter to help manage our supply to these lower demand levels. We restarted paper production at the mill in early October, partly as a result of our demand outlook relative to our inventory levels as well as the scheduled outage at our International Falls Mill earlier this month. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and we'll run on our system accordingly.\n I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. For 3 quarters now, our employees across the company ran their operations safely and in a cost-effective manner during the pandemic. They are doing an outstanding job in adhering to the processes and strict protocols we have instituted to help protect them and their families. What makes this even more remarkable is that our employees focus on these new work requirements is occurring while we are experiencing unprecedented demand within our packaging business, and they continue to successfully meet the expectations of our containerboard and box customers.\n Everyone has worked very hard to overcome the challenges and obstacles we face this year, and I couldn't be more proud of the entire organization as well as the strong partnerships we have with our customers and suppliers. Looking ahead, as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect corrugated products demand to remain strong. Although box shipments will be lower than the third quarter with 3 less shipping days, volumes should be higher than last year's record fourth quarter shipments. In early October, a second hurricane, Hurricane Delta, again, impacted operations at our DeRidder Mill by approximately 4 days and almost 8,000 tons, which further challenged our historically low inventory position.\n However, we expect higher containerboard production volume compared to the third quarter as we work towards building some inventory prior to year-end in preparation for the first quarter of 2021 scheduled maintenance outages and expected continued strong demand. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, the converted #3 machine at the Wallula Mill as well as the mill itself is currently running to its capacity. However, we do plan to get some additional volume during 2021 after we optimize the OCC plant capital project, we're currently finishing up and complete some reliability improvements.\n Therefore, to help bring our inventory back to an appropriate level by year-end, beginning in November, we will also be producing high-performance virgin linerboard on the #3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama Mill, in addition to any white paper needs. Most of you know, for some time that the Jackson mill has always been an option for us to address our strategic, integrated containerboard supply needs that's capable of providing the necessary runway to grow our downstream converting demand.\n We've done numerous studies and estimates over the last few years, and with the depressed demand in the uncoated free sheet market for Jackson products, our integration rate consistently in the upper 90s percent range, our historically low inventory levels, and limited outside availability of the types of containerboard we need to run the mix our box plants require, now is the perfect time to do some trial work and learn some things relative to the studies we have performed.\n We're confident, however, of our ability to produce high-quality virgin craft containerboard for use in our box plants during this period. The #3 machine at Jackson is a great, very versatile machine and the mill infrastructure itself allows us the necessary flexibility and optionality to react appropriately to our containerboard and white paper needs during these fluid and dynamic times.\n Obviously, to fully utilize the potential of the mill to produce containerboard at an optimal cost and quality, the future capital investments and process changes in a phased approach will be required, and we'll use this period to further refine our estimates and assumptions as well as our volume and capital spending plans for 2021.\n Continuing on, as Tom mentioned, we expect to begin realizing in the Pacific Northwest. As well as the display and high-end graphics business for the holiday period normally falls off during the quarter. In addition, we expect average export prices to move higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. In our Paper segment, although demand during this period is well below historical levels, as schools and businesses have reopened, to some extent, volume has improved since the low point reached during the second quarter.\n However, we believe our sales volume in the fourth quarter will be lower than the seasonally stronger third quarter although with the scheduled outage we had at our International Falls Mill earlier this month, our Jackson Mill was restarted on October 6. Beginning sometime in early November, the mill will be in a position to begin producing an appropriate amount of white paper to maintain the optimal inventory levels and service our customers require as well as begin the trials and production of containerboard that I just referred to.\n We also expect freight costs to be higher and with anticipated colder weather, energy costs should be higher as well. And finally, as Bob mentioned, scheduled maintenance outage cost should be about $0.11 per share higher than the third quarter. As certain areas of the economy continue to reopen, shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions are expected to continue changing across the country, especially considering the upcoming colder weather and holiday gatherings.\n There continues to be numerous events and actions that could impact our expectations for the upcoming quarter and the operation of not only our facilities but also adversely impacting the needs of our customers and the availability of services and products we rely on from our suppliers. As a result, we are still not able to appropriately quantify our guidance for the fourth quarter. And with that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involved inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual reports could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.\n And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions. Go ahead. I think as we look at the paper machine at Jackson and the mill in general, you have to keep in mind that for 8 years now, we've not only thought about this, but we've worked towards enhancing the capability of the mill and its flexibility. We would run the mill to supply both our white paper needs and our containerboard needs as such. We believe where we are currently, we're in a good place to do that. The costs that you talk about, it's truly the fact that we will have higher input costs in terms of production of containerboard on that machine. The mill obviously, is not fully configured as you would think about integrated containerboard mill to run high capa at the speeds to get the big tonnage out. But nevertheless we can produce a good quality sheet. And at the same time, maintain the flexibility of the mill to provide our paper customers what is required. And it gives us a chance to see what and how long this pandemic plays out. And then at the end of this pandemic, what the paper demand will ultimately look like. So it's an elegant way for us to understand the capability of Jackson long term, while at the same time, understanding how we need to supply our paper business short-term and long term. With that, Bob, do you have anything on the cost side? George, does that satisfy that? Well, again, for anybody that knows us, you would have to believe we have done an awful lot of work with our annual maintenance work, with the annual upgrades that we do to bolster and beef up the capability of the infrastructure. That being said, we're -- we have a lot of knowledge in this arena. And as far as the cost, there should not be a great deal of cost in terms of the trialing. But again, I would expect us to be able to get on grade rather quickly and produce a very high-quality sheet, albeit at lower normal production rates than you would see at our conventional containerboard virgin mills. Thank you. Next question please? I'm going to have Tom start that answer off by answering George's last question and then getting into yours, Tom, why don't you talk about the volume and then get that? No, the number machine is the big machine from the 1990s. It's about 365 inches wide. It's a big, high speed, modern machine, lots of capability. Quite frankly, we've always spoken in terms of relative quality of machine. The machines at DeRidder were good machines, machine out of Wallula that we converted, the #3 was a better machine than what we converted at DeRidder. But quite frankly, this Jackson machine's a better machine than all of those put together. It has that capability if we determine that, that would -- made sense to us. Obviously, the machine that we're willing to think about it. White top, you would have to put a top sheet on with a mini fourdrinier. But in capital spending and upgrades to a machine that was going to be permanently converted in the future years, you would more than likely put many fourdrinier on that machine that can handle brown or a bleached fiber. And then the machine currently has a size press, so you wouldn't have to add a size press, so it just determines in terms of where we believe, where we need to take that mill and what's the demand look like. So there's lots and lots of opportunity.\n Next question, please? You pretty much get the flexibility without the lags. Next question, please? No. Keep in mind, I Falls and Jackson have supplied the marketplace. With cut size as an example, we -- it's the same product. We also have the ability, and we've had that for years at eye falls on the smaller machine to produce color grades. And so we were producing a few of the color grades during this period of time, but also just running out of inventory. A little more pointedly to answer your question, I Falls ultimately has the ability to supply our current customer portfolio if, in fact, that's all that was required in terms of future demand destruction.\n But that remains to be determined where we end up with that. But I Falls is a very versatile capable mill. No. We'll update you in January. We have some numbers in the back of our mind that we think we're capable of, but I don't want to put that out until we prove it ourselves. And then as time goes on, you would have to imagine a mill the size of Jackson with the appropriate level of capital has a tremendous opportunity to supply just about anything that the Packaging side of the business needs for the foreseeable future. If growth demands that. So we've got lots of optionality in that regard, and we'll play it out that way. Thank you. Next question, please? Let me -- a little bit to help quantify that question. If you recall, when we started this process at Wallula almost 4 years ago, and we -- and then we took the machine brown without all of the benefits of the major capital. We called out we expected, they'll produce probably about 700 tons a day of a good craft linerboard on that machine at Wallula. And don't forget the Wallula machines is a narrower machine. It's almost 100 inches narrower. The machine at Jackson is wider. But quite frankly, we're hoping in the same relative terms to be able to produce that type of volume, 700 or 800 tons a day of production. But again, that remains to be seen.\n The challenge is on the folks at the mill and our technology organization over the upcoming weeks. But theoretically, that machine has that kind of capability currently. And then it's -- as far as its future capability, it's just capital dependent. Well, not in a big way. We know that we've got some opportunity with the OCC plant. We'll be starting that up after the first of the year. We'll be finalizing the actual project work as we wrap up this fourth quarter. And then getting ready to start it up. That will lend itself to a benefit in terms of fiber furnish makeup and drainage, pressing, drying capabilities, quality characteristics.\n And then also, we've had some ongoing project work on #2 machine at Wallula. That's a smaller machine. But as of next year, we'll be adding a new head box and new wetting capability, we'll see tremendous more reliability and quality benefits from this work. So incrementally, we'll see improvements. But as we've always said, Wallula Mill, on a run rate basis, was probably going to be around 600,000 tons a year. And we're there. As of this past summer, we've been running the mill depending on grade mix, right at that run rate tonnage on an annual basis of about 600,000 tons a year. And we're very pleased with that. Next question, please. Yes. If you assume that the pandemic-related impacts continue on through next year, we would anticipate about 50% production of white paper coming out of the mill, which would then allow us the flexibility to take care of some extra brown linerboard for the system. So -- but we would expect about 50% white paper coming out of that mill to support our anticipated customer demands. I'm not going to -- we'll talk more in January after we've had the 3 months under our belt and can really give you some hard numbers and a little bit better conviction on what we see. Next questoin, please. Thank you. Next question. Well, quite honestly, whenever you see a hurricane like this, because of all the damaged trees, there's a glut of wood available. You just have to get the producers into the woods to get the wood out to the mill. So the landowners and the producers have to get the wood out in a timely manner before it starts rotting and decaying in the woods.\n So besides -- for a short period of time, the impact of localized flooding, longer term, I don't expect to see any big impact on the fiber supply, fiber cost to the mill.\n Next question. I think we've got time for -- go ahead. Let me answer the cash question. I think we went back to the first quarter, a similar question. And I think I answered and I said I wasn't concerned about the level of cash and we were basically in very uncertain times.\n But I think I said at the time that I would let you know when I thought we had too much cash. And I still have that same position that we are still living in very uncertain times. And I'll let you know when we have too much cash. Operator, I believe we're out of time. Yes, everyone, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of January. Stay safe, stay well. Have a nice holiday. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Mundy",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. We had very good cash generation in the third quarter with cash provided by operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $196 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $102 million, common stock dividends totaled $75 million, pension payments of $71 million, $21 million for federal and state income tax payments and net interest payments of $7 million.\n We ended the quarter with $949 million of cash on hand or just under $1.1 billion, including marketable securities. Our liquidity at September 30 was just over $1.4 billion. Regarding Hurricane Laura-related costs and expenses at our DeRidder Mill, based on the way our insurance coverages work for named storms such as this. There are separate deductibles for property damage and the time element or business interruption aspects of our coverage.\n The costs incurred over the months of August and September did not meet the deductibles for either of these, so there will not be an insurance claim filed for these damages and downtime, which together totaled just under $10 million. Finally, as Mark indicated, because of our extremely low containerboard inventory and expected continued strong demand, we postponed a scheduled third quarter machine outage at DeRidder, and we will postpone the mill's large planned discretionary fourth quarter outage that we mentioned on last quarter's call.\n As a result, our planned outage expense for the third quarter came in $0.04 per share lower than what we last discussed. And a revised estimate for the fourth quarter is now expected to be $0.23 per share or $0.11 per share higher a than the third quarter.\n This would put us at $0.66 per share in total for the full year 2020. We are currently assessing when to reschedule these outages as well as  the entire planned outage schedule for 2021, and we'll communicate that to you in January as we normally do.\n I'll now turn it back over to Mark. George, just looking at 3Q to 4Q and starting -- I'm not sure what you have in your model. But as we've said, the outages will be higher by $0.11 from third quarter. And we referred to freight costs. I think if you compare it to our -- the last 2 or 3 years relative to 3Q to 4Q, I would expect our freight cost to be higher than what it has been historically. Energy may be a little bit higher, where demand is in the Packaging segment, as we head into a holiday season, the overtime requirements because of the strong demand, labor benefits costs would be a little bit higher than normal.\n And as Mark referred to, it's running Jackson, running white and brown. And then as we do some of the work that we plan to do to improve the linerboard that we'll be running there, there will be some cost hiccups. So we certainly have something in there for that as we sort of do these -- do this work and make this linerboard in the fourth quarter that -- so you have some cost in some of the variable areas that you normally wouldn't see going from 3Q to 4Q. No. I think you're right, Gabe, I think you're in the right ballpark, and that certainly will help in -- with our cost absorption in the quarter as we increase production to get our inventories up. No. Yes, Mark. Obviously, the -- your fixed costs are fixed. Whether you're producing or not, you have a substantial amount of cost there and of course, a portion of your indirects as well. So I would say that's not a good clean look as you were referring to of a 1 mill paper system. No. I think that's -- I'm not going to quantify that for you, but that is -- it will improve somewhat in the fourth quarter because we did run Jackson or we are running Jackson rather as we speak. But you still will -- it's -- we're not going to quantify right now, I guess, what the what a 1 mill system would look like from a cost perspective. But maybe next year, sometime as things unfold relative to packaging demand and our paper demand as well. Well, Adam, I guess the -- if you look at what our internal numbers were for the last 3 quarters, counting the third versus where we ended up, we were off. I'm not going to say whether we were better or worse. But -- and if we had put those numbers out there, it would have been a lot of discussion around why we didn't come closer to our guidance. And just for the same reasons we've said every call and what Mark said in today's call, it's -- and Tom's comments around the demand and where that went to. It's just too -- things are too fluid.\n And when you look at the fourth quarter of this year, especially with how we're going to be running Jackson, there's a lot of assumptions in there about our containerboard production as well as our paper needs. And depending on how that swings, it can move your cost wildly. And it's just another reason that -- another added degree of uncertainty relative to providing fourth quarter guidance. That's something we'll say for another day, Adam. That's not -- that's -- what we've done historically is working well for us. These are unusual times, which is why we've taken a pause relative to what we've done historically. And when things get normalized, whatever that means, we'll evaluate that as far as how we do it going forward. And George, regarding your I'm sorry, regarding your inventory question, I went back as far as 2013, and these are from a supply -- available supply standpoint, we're lower than we were back then. And I didn't go back any further because, obviously, that's sort of when the transformation of the company occurred with the Boise acquisition. So yes, these are historically low levels of inventory."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan, and please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2020 earnings release conference call.

I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide more details, after which I'll wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $57 million or $0.59 per share, excluding the special items, second quarter 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share compared to the second quarter of 2019 net income of $194 million or $2.04 per share.

Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our Paper segment. Bob will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Special items expenses also included the previously reported closure of our corrugated products facility in San Lorenzo California and costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Details of all special items for the second quarter of 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items that we mentioned, the $0.66 per share decrease in second quarter 2020 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment of $0.66, and paper segment $0.05, lower volumes in our paper segment $0.40, and higher depreciation expense $0.04. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.33 primarily in the areas of labor infringes, repairs, materials and supplies and several fixed cost areas. We also have lower annual outage expenses of $0.10, lower converting costs $0.03, lower freight expenses $0.02, and other costs $0.01. Looking at our packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter of 2020 of $313 million with sales of $1.4 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $349 million and sales of $1.5 billion or 23% margin. We ran our containerboard mills to demand, built some much needed inventory from the historically low levels at the end of first quarter, and maintained the industry leading integration rate by supplying our box plants with the necessary containerboard to establish a new second quarter record for box shipments per day. We ended the second quarter with inventory still at the relatively low levels, but in adequate position to meet our expected stronger third quarter demand. Our efficiencies and cost control at the mills in corrugated products facilities throughout the quarter were truly remarkable and we continue to see improvements in freight and logistics expenses through the optimization of our trucking operations in geographic footprint of our containerboard supply. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on our containerboard sales in the Corrugated business.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thanks Mark. Demand for our corrugated products was very good in the second quarter, especially during the month of June. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new second quarter record for shipments per day which were up 1.2% compared to last year second quarter. Total shipments for the quarter were also up 1.2% over last year. As a comparison for the second quarter, the industry was down 1.4% in total and on a work day basis. Through the first half of 2020, our box shipment volume is up 2.5% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 0.6%. Outside sales volume of containerboard was about 10,000 tons below last year second quarter and 23,000 tons below the first quarter of 2020, as we ran our containerboard system to demand, supply the record needs of our box plants, and positioned our inventory for even higher demand during an expected stronger third quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.61 per share below the second quarter of 2019 and down $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Export containerboard prices were down about $0.05 per share versus last year second quarter and flat compared to the first quarter of 2020. Finally, I'd like to point out that the benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we spoken about over the last couple of years are continuing to gain traction. As we have said many times this strategy of improving the technology and equipment in various plants, as well as the construction of new box plants is based upon our customer's needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them. We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and various operating and conversion cost areas. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $5 million with sales of $123 million or a 4% margin compared to second quarter 2019 EBITDA of $48 million and sales of $238 million for a 20% margin. Second quarter paper prices and mix were about 5% below last year and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2020. As expected our sales volume was about 45% below last year and as announced back in April we had our Jackson mill down for the months of May and June to help manage our supply with our demand outlook. Unfortunately our view of demand as we approach the end of June did not improve to the point of allowing us to restart the mill resulting in us recently announcing that Jackson will also be down for the months of July and August. We'll continue to assess the market conditions for potential September restart of the mill. And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Mundy: Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations for the second quarter was $227 million with free cash flow of $146 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $81 million, common stock dividends of $75 million, net interest payments of $41 million, and cash taxes of $39 million. We ended the quarter with $853 million of cash on hand or $977 million including marketable securities. Our liquidity yet June 30 was just over $1.3 billion. During the second quarter, uncoated freesheet market conditions and especially demand for our cut-size office paper products continue to deteriorate rapidly arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. These conditions along with the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations resulted in a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets within our Paper segment. Due to this triggering event and a more likely than not assessment that an impairment of goodwill occurred, an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020 was performed. Based on this evaluation, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the Paper segment and recognized a non-cash impairment charge totaling $55.2 million. The impairment charge is not tax deductible. We also performed a recoverability test on the long-lived assets within our Paper segment, including long-lived intangible assets, as of May 31, 2020. The results of this test indicated that these assets were 100% recoverable. Lastly, we are planning to take a - or to make a change to the scheduled outages in our containerboard meals for the fourth quarter of this year versus what we discussed during last quarter's call. Our current plans are to pull forward some recovery borrow work at the DeRidder mill from next year to eliminate the risk of unscheduled downtime and during this period, perform a high return capital project on the number one paper machine real section. The fourth quarter estimate for a scheduled outages is now $0.59 per share and the full year estimate is now a $1.05 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. As in the first quarter, the employees at all of our manufacturing and office locations ran their operation safely in a very cost effective manner, while facing the unprecedented conditions brought on by COVID-19 pandemic. All facilities continued to operate in adherence to CDC guidelines and followed a strict protocol for workplace operations, as well as notification of in response to potential issues. Although we did experience some challenges during the second quarter, we have not experienced any material disruption in our operations or our supply chain due to the pandemic. The accomplishments by our employees during this period with the help of our customers and suppliers were truly amazing. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will stay focused on preserving our financial and balance sheet strength during these uncertain times. We will remain well-positioned to manage whatever lies ahead while ensuring that we take care of the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. During the unprecedented times, corrugated products demand has performed quite well so far this year and we expect a third quarter to be even stronger. We began the third quarter with replenished yet still relatively low containerboard inventories and our expectation is that we'll end the quarter at levels below where we started well managing scheduled outages at two of our mills. We've already announced the actions being taken in the paper business and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the demand for our paper products throughout the third quarter. However shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions continue to change constantly across the country and such events and actions could adversely impact those expectations in the operations of not only our facilities, but also the availability of services and products we rely upon from our suppliers. As a result we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance from third quarter. With that, I\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we\u2019ve made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Shelby, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from George Staphos of Bank of America.\nGeorge Staphos: I wanted to ask a couple of questions on paper and then I'll do one on packaging and turn it over. So shorter term and recognizing it it\u2019s tough to guide on paper. You know it sounds like demand really hasn't changed much from your commentary. It looks like at a minimum right now Jackson will be down about the similar amount as it was down this past quarter. You know barring any change in pricing, which you can't comment to anyway, would there be any reason why 3Q earning could be terribly different from 2Q with that volume outlook?\nMark Kowlzan: Let me comment and I\u2019ll let Bob comment also. Again you know the sales have picked up somewhat for cut-size. The problem is they haven't picked up enough that you can justify starting the mill and running full.\nGeorge Staphos: Yes.\nMark Kowlzan: And so it's not economical to do that. So we're running out of inventory and running out of what the I Falls Mill can produce. And the volume pickup we're seeing is what you'd expect with the reopening of various states and businesses, some of the back-to-school reordering, some of the big box stores planning on some of their volume that would be moving out into school activity. And so everything hinges on what truly happens to the economy in terms of how stable is this reopening and how fast does it occur et cetera. From the financials, Bob why don't you comment on what we\u2019d expect to see?\nA \u2013Robert Mundy: Yes George I would think that you probably you know you're thinking about things correctly you know based on the assumptions we've made and that we've stated and if those hold true then I would think you're not you shouldn't be far off.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. Thanks for that, Bob. Second question on paper, and I realize it's tough to speak to this live mic and we're still early into this reduced trend, but how does the goodwill impairment. How does the demand decline that we've seen change if at all your view on the paper assets both in terms of their current operating stance and how you might be able to use those assets longer term either in their current form or in a different form. And then my last question I'll turn it over. You mentioned that the third quarter demand is looking good and if things continue, obviously, there are no guarantees in life. You know inventories wind up lower. What are your customers telling you though? What concerns might they have about the phase out or lowering of that $600 week additional unemployment payment that people have been getting and how it might relate to consumption, if you have any Intel or view on that? Thank you guys. Good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. George on the first part of your question regarding the impairment, impairment simply was a technical matter. And so, we went through the trigger analysis and it was truly just an SEC trigger requirement, you know non-cash charge cleans up the balance sheet. But don't forget, if you think about we've been operating our paper business for about eight years now, and the paper business has probably generated I\u2019d estimate $1.1 billion of EBITDA during the time, it's been on a very good business for us. If you take this pandemic out of the picture, it's still you know is a good business. And so, who knows again how fast the economy recovers and demand recovers. Nevertheless, we have a lot of optionality in how we utilize the paper business and the assets within the paper business. Tom, do you want to talk about demand?\nA \u2013Thomas Hassfurther: Yes, as indicated George, currently we're starting out quite well in demand you know typical question that it gets asked is, where are we at this point in time through 17 days we\u2019re up just under 1%. And you know and that's against a very tough comp, a year ago I believe, we were up about 3.9% on a per workday basis. So, you know that's a good start to the quarter. You know you asked a question about our customers and are - what are their effects from the $600 or the potential effects from the $600 unemployment. I think most of that we've got some customers who are concerned about getting employees back, because in some cases they are making more money probably on unemployment than they would be working. But there I think for the most part people want to work and they want to get back to work. And so our customers that are continue to grow they expect to continue to bring their employees back.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.\nMark Wilde: I've got a couple of questions. The first one just kind of back on Jackson. I'm just curious whether there are any issues in serving kind of your primary customers that just a single mill and then whether the extended downtime there makes it difficult to retain skilled workers at that site?\nA \u2013Thomas Hassfurther: First part of the question we've got complete flexibility between the I Falls portfolio capability and the Jackson capability. And so it's just a matter of you know what does the demand look like and then where is it appropriate to make. So, we're okay for the time being. Again your question regarding employee retention and talent retention, obviously that's always a concern. And so it's really a matter of how long this goes on. But don't forget this is taking place throughout the paper industry. And so we had spent quite a bit of time during that period of late May and June going through the mill from top to bottom really putting the assets in great condition. And so, the mill sits there ready to run. The employees know that. And so again, we're just going to evaluate market conditions and at the right time that mill can run in and will run when necessary.\nMark Wilde: And if I could just ask on Jackson one other thing Mark, is there anything from just from an engineering standpoint that would make it difficult to produce other products at Jackson. It\u2019s a fairly new machine as I recall kind of a late 1990s vintage machine?\nMark Kowlzan: We have total flexibility and optionality with the Jackson assets and anybody that knows us would have to assume that we have studied all potential options and we have as we've done, as an example at Wallula into Ritter. We could take those assets if need be and you know apply them to a containerboard, if need be. But in the meantime, we don't see that happening. Again, there is always a capital cost and capital varies from mill asset to mill asset. But to your point, the big machine at a Jackson is one of the biggest cut size uncoated machines in North America. So, it's a really good paper machine and the mill you know in general is a very good mill asset. So again, it's got tremendous optionality for the future and - but just keep in mind that you know if anybody is thinking that you just convert it tomorrow think about all of the capital that it\u2019s you know we have employed over the years to bring on the efficiencies at a mill like Wallula, it doesn't happen overnight, and there's a phased approach. But again you know I am betting on the fact that, demand will pick up for the paper business and we'll see that come back.\nMark Wilde: Okay. All right. The other question I had Mark is just in terms of dry powder, I mean, you've got over $10 a share of dry powder. I wondered, if you can just give us some sense of the parameters for you know what you might do on the acquisition side, or what you might not do, I think in the past you've said, you weren't interested in going south from the U.S. It didn't sound like Europe was really an interest. So just frame for us kind of if you could, where you would be willing and where you wouldn't be willing to use that capital over time?\nMark Kowlzan: I think the best choice is that we continue to make the smaller bolt-on acquisitions on the box plant side of the business. Highly accretive opportunities that would come along, we would certainly be in a position to take those on and put them in the portfolio. That's always the primary driver and then we'll always figure out where we're going to supply containerboard into that system. If the high class problem arose that we had more demand than the capability to produce, we've got the optionality on how we go about our short-term and long-term, short-term we could buy tons on the outside market, long-term, we could figure out how to produce them internally. And so, I think it still holds, we have no desire to go offshore with any investment. We will stay in the lower 48 states as seen in our volume year-to-date in our volume in the second quarter. Our very diverse customer base pays-off quite well for us in terms of what we can service across the United States and our customers recognize that. So, we will continue to invest in the existing asset base to enhance the capability. And that - quite frankly that's our highest return opportunity right now is to continue to allow Tom and the box plants to reinvest in their capabilities we've been doing over the last couple of years. And we've seen tremendous results from that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Connelly of Stephens.\nMark Connelly: Thanks. Mark, it sounds like you're fine with your inventories now, but I'm curious whether you did see any significant cost or inefficiency either because your inventories were lower because your customers orders were unpredictable and I'm worried - I'm wondering whether that lack of predictability or logistics might be a bigger issue in Q3?\nMark Kowlzan: No, I think again everything we've been doing over the last couple of years to simplify our portfolio in terms of our containerboard inventory - the SKUs what Tom uses in terms of the basis weights and we've gone primarily to a high performance mix of containerboard that we use. We keep that internal with our nationwide logistics capability and regional supply. We've been able to minimize the inventory requirements there. As far as customer and uncertainties again, we can pretty well produce what we need we're in - not in the - again I don't see any problems in this third quarter that would be related to uncertainties. Tom, do you want to comment on where we are at I think what took place.\nThomas Hassfurther: No, and I agree with you. I mean and quite frankly I mean given our customer base and the way we operate, we're up for any uncertainty that comes along.\nMark Connelly: That's a good answer. Just one question on freight rates, we're starting to see freight rates pick up again after a dip earlier this year and I can't remember when you redo your contracts. But do you have a view on how rising freight rates are going to affect you in the next year?\nMark Kowlzan: Well again, I think you know with - based on demand, as the economy started opening up, we definitely saw some tightening up on both truck and rail. And so in some ways, we'll deal with that, that\u2019s a healthy sign. But again the fact is that with the diversified production portfolio nationwide, we can manage the logistics costs better than we've ever been able to do. And so, but - we are seeing some upward pressure. I\u2019ll talk to you more on that.\nMark Connelly: Do have a significant - part of your transportation on an annual contract with - a reset at this time of the year?\nMark Kowlzan: No, no.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Maguire: Just hoping to get a little bit more color on the third quarter volume outlook for corrugated. I know you spoke many times both in the press release and in the comments about expecting much better trends. Could you clarify is that better than the sort of 2.5% year-to-date trend you were talking about? And then, recognizing it's a tough comp in the July number being up a little bit less than 1% maybe not, quite hitting that you know 2.5% bogey, if that is the bogey? So are you seeing - are there some new customers that are coming in later in the quarter that you're expecting to kind of ramp up or are you just seeing the order book start to accelerate now into late July and August that you expect the trends to improve as the quarter progresses?\nThomas Hassfurther: Brian, this is Tom, I'll take that question. Of course we were up - we've been up the 2.5% as we talked about. We're building on that going into July. Our forecast will continue to build on that through the quarter and have a very good quarter providing. As Mark indicated earlier, we don't have some shutdowns as a result of the pandemic or anything like that, that occurs as long as the economy continues to open, I think the trends will be quite good. The comps do get a little easier as the quarter goes on. As I indicated, July was our largest increase last year. So things are pretty positive and I'll also add as I discussed on the last quarter call, the food service business had really been hurt quite badly and the Ag business that supplies the food service side had been hurt quite badly in the quarter. And that's beginning to come back now as restaurants open up and schools open up. We'll see more of that activity which is good, and the durables business has started to come back. And as you saw the durables numbers were quite good. So that's - those are good accelerators for us in the third quarter.\nBrian Maguire: And then Mark, you didn\u2019t mention, but I'm going to assume they're still doing great is e-commerce. And so my next question is just, as the industry start - continues to shift toward the e-commerce and it seems like there's maybe a bit step function change as a result of COVID here. Do you see that as a good thing or a bad thing for PCA? Is that - are you guys uniquely positioned within the industry to take advantage of that or not or do you think there could be any positives or negatives specific to the mix shift regardless of how it kind of impacts volume growth in general?\nMark Kowlzan: No e-commerce is a good thing, it's a good thing for PCA and it's a good thing for the entire industry. And also as we see it continuing to grow and I think there's a big consumer shift that's already taken place and even as the economy opens. I think people will continue to participate in e-commerce category quite heavily.\nBrian Maguire: Okay. And just last one from me. And I know you expect to give figure guidance and you're not able to give it because of the lockdowns. But if we just kind of froze things where they are, and didn't see any more rollback in the lockdowns. There's been everything going it seems like third quarter EPS you would have been able to guide to something - it would have been quite a bit better than where 2Q was given the exit rate on all these trends and sort of what I'm hearing about the volume outlook in packaging?\nRobert Mundy: Well, Brian, when George asked a question earlier I think it sort of gave an indication that there are some things that are positive certainly on the volume side. But there will be some seasonal cost that that can go the other way. So all things being equal, we would - if based on our assumptions it should be we would expect it to be fairly similar. There's also some mix things and we talked about freight just from a mix perspective like freight as an example. It\u2019s not that, there's a little bit of upward pressure, but there's also I guess some mix related things that cause freight cost to go up from 2Q to Q3 some of that would be like for my pause in our paper business we have to still get some paper down in the part of the country that we have the mill down. So things like that and there's some things going on, on the containerboard side you know drive that up. As well as certainly, energy usage during this part of the - this time of the year is a lot higher and our outages based on the numbers we gave you on guidance you know outages. If you look at what we've said that\u2019s $0.07 a share so right there so.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global.\nMark Weintraub: Just a question on the pull forward of the DeRidder recovery boiler project. So in 2018 and 2019, maintenance expense have been order of magnitude $0.61. And now this year given that pull forward you're guiding to about a $1.05 for this year. As we think about next year, does - a starting point. Does it make sense to be at the $0.60 level or is the DeRidder pulling forward so that next year all things equal that it could be lower than the $0.61?\nMark Kowlzan: Mark, it's hard - think about the reason we want to pull this outage up is to take advantage of the fact that we have to take DeRidder down for part of its annual outage anyways and we\u2019re doing the DeRidder number one machine annual during that fourth quarter. And in the work we're doing on D1 we had recognized an opportunity to significantly upgrade the winder capability and go to a fourth set real automatic conveyor of reals into the winder back stance and really enhance the efficiencies of the machine. So, we have a very high return of capital project, which is taking a couple of weeks of downtime opportunity. We also recognize that the recovery boiler was going to be requiring a superheater replacement next year, which typically is in most cases about a three week outage type of job depending on the work, three weeks, three-and-a-half weeks of work. And we looked at it and said, well, we're going to take a longer outage on the big paper machine in the fall. And we know that within six months, you're going to have to take another longer outage that you know is the recovery boiler, which you know impacts cost. And we thought well, there are some uncertainties about the economy not knowing what demand is doing and where the world is going to be in the fourth quarter. We thought it was probably prudent to go ahead and pull up the outage, get the work done on the paper machine, get all of this work done on the recovery boiler, and put that behind us. And so, that without quantifying what that does to the annual shutdown cost next year, obviously, it eliminates that cost next year. And so, you not only eliminate that shutdown cost next year, but you see immediate results from the paper machine upgrade work and the reliability that you bring to bear with the boiler work that we're doing. So I don't want to try to quantify what that means for 2021s maintenance outage expenses.\nMark Weintraub: And maybe one help if you could. Would the Recovery Boiler project would have that been a once every seven year type thing, which is exceptional or would that be in kind of the normal course?\nMark Kowlzan: No it's probably once a decade type of opportunity in the superheaters you know quite frankly superheaters you change out probably every 25 years.\nMark Weintraub: Got it.\nMark Kowlzan: But you typically it varies to work you're doing on a power boiler or a recovery boiler. The most complex work you do would be work such as a generator suction tubes and or a superheater suction tubes. In this case, we felt it was prudent to just go ahead and move this up, take advantage of this and there was no reason to wait. But it costs us. But it's an boiler would cost for next year.\nMark Weintraub: Yes. Is there any help you can provide at this stage for us as you have done the analysis on the options at Jackson of order of magnitude what type of capital to achieve what type of end result would be entailed recognizing that it's still a process under consideration as opposed to anything that's been determined?\nMark Kowlzan: You know as again you would have to believe that we have in our files a various listing of opportunities and the costs of those opportunities and what could be done in that over what period of time. That being said if you look at our history over the last three decades whenever we've done big projects and big conversions we do it in phases. I don't want to try to quantify what that cost would be. It's not proper to do that, but it is a significant cost. I'll leave it at that.\nMark Weintraub: Okay.\nMark Kowlzan: To do it right, to do it properly, it would be a significant cost, but if that were to play out that way that would mean that we have a significant opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question is from Neel Kumar from Morgan Stanley.\nNeel Kumar: On a same-day basis, your corrugated shipments were up 1.2% versus the industry, which is down 1.4% for the quarter. What allowed you to outperform relative to industry volume, would you attribute that your end market or geographical mix or perhaps having more local first national kind of exposure?\nThomas Hassfurther: Neel, this is Tom. I think our performance is really just you know where we're aligned with thousands of customers. We're still primarily local and regional, although we have a decent national footprint as well. And I think, we were fortunate to be able to grow with the customers that we have. In addition, we did pick up some new customers as well, just where the opportunities presented themselves. And you know it's kind of a continuation of what we do and what we do so well and the way we execute, and operate so efficiently, and it's also obviously a result of the capital that we talked about, that we invested in our businesses to be able to do that. So you know we had in \u2013 some cases, we had customers who were expanding and wanted to grow and wanted to grow with us, and you know we made the investments to be able to do that. So you know that's been our strategy for a long time and will continue to be our strategy.\nNeel Kumar: Great. That's helpful. And can you just also talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the export markets, prices look like they've come down, but the board recently in Europe and Central South America, and there seems to be some softness maybe in China as well. So generally speaking how has demand geared in some of your key export regions versus the domestic market over the last several months?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, as we talked about many times you know we don't have a large export footprint, but the one we do have is with long, long-term customers who have been in the business obviously you know and for a long time. And are good players in their marketplace. The demand has been relatively flat. The pricing had come down. It stayed flat for a while. And you know who knows what's going to happen down the road, I'm not going to speculate on that. But our demand on the export side has been steady and you know that's what we continue to expect and maybe even up a little depending on how things open up around the rest of the world.\nOperator: Your next question is from Debbie Jones of Deutsche Bank.\nDebbie Jones: I wanted to ask if you are buying a material amount of board outside your own system currently I think in the past you've been willing to provide that. And if so you know it is advance stage study and you do this project in the fourth quarter taking linerboard now down for a bit. Do you need to buy more tons to support your system?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Debbie, on the first part of the question. The only board we buy on the outside right now currently is specialty type grade white top would be a good example. And then there is some specialty products that we use. That's essentially what we've been buying for the last couple of years. As far as in the fourth quarter with the outage, obviously, we got some flexibility in as we go through the third quarter and we look at what the fourth quarter end looks like. We\u2019ll figure out how we run the system. We've got great opportunities, we could and in a worst high-class situation, you could go by some board on the outside market, if you had to. But we're not anticipating that right now. So, it just requires us to manage our business well as we go into the month of October and November.\nDebbie Jones: And can you just touch cost earlier. I was wondering, if you could just talk a bit more about what fiber OCC cost and how that's trying to reiterate you in Q2 and into Q3?\nMark Kowlzan: Would fiber costs in general we're seeing flat, I mean, there is nothing. It's typically what you\u2019d see with weather-related phenomenon and on seasonal-related phenomena with tied to weather events, but nothing unusual.\nOperator: Your next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.\nRandy Toth: This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony. Can you just quick update us on the OCC plant bill at Wallula. I think originally, it was expected to be completed by a year-end, has the timeline changed at all due to that pandemic? And then just bigger picture, has you're thinking about virgin versus recycled fiber mix changed at all over the past nine months or so [technical difficulty]? Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Regarding the project we're still on schedule to the end of the year and it hasn't changed our view in the entire premise and investing the money into a new OCC plant in Wallula was to provide complete optionality of fiber opportunities in that mill. That mill if you can imagine being in the Pacific Northwest is the highest wood cost basket for paper mills in North America. And so, having the ability to utilize OCC and various wood fibers gives us the optionality we need there. So it's still something we would believe is a good thing to do and important thing to do to fiber that mill up for the future. So it hasn't changed our outlook on where we are.\nOperator: Your next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.\nAdam Josephson: Tom, in terms of your box demand outlook for the balance of the quarter, and this year has been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride. Obviously there's the panic buying surge in March and then the economy shutdown, some industry box demand obviously went down in April and May. And then June and July have been much better, I assume because of inventory restocking, correct me, if you think otherwise? So just given these big swings up and down, what would you say your visibility and confidence level is for the balance of the quarter and for that matter in 4Q. And you've always said the box demand is tied to the economy and when you're talking about the paper business, you said look depends on the reopening et cetera? Does the same apply to your box business?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes Adam, the second part of your question, yes some of that does depend on the box business. You know if suddenly we had a big surge in the United States of COVID and we had certain businesses closed back down or big, big regions closed down. Some of those segments we talked about like food service that would be impacted. However, the indicators are that that's not going to be the case and that we've got the potential to continue to open up the economy. And if that takes place, we're quite bullish. The ups and downs, I think are when you say inventory restocking, I would say that most of our customers have kept their inventories at very low levels period. And so the surge is more demand-related than it is investor stocking-related and that requires because I can - you can really feel it in the short turnaround timeframes that we've got to - that we've got to produce the boxes. And this is what our customers are telling us likewise. So, they're sitting there with lower inventories, trying to manage their business, but also wanting to take advantage of every opportunity they have as this economy continues to open up.\nAdam Josephson: And just on 3Q, Bob I think you mentioned that in response to George's question that paper earnings could be expected to be relatively similar sequentially. And it sounds like you have pretty good confidence on box demand for the balance of the quarter. So, I guess back to the guidance question, why - don't you feel comfortable giving 3Q guidance, given that box demand will presumably be good and given your - it seems the likelihood of the paper earnings will be flattish sequentially?\nRobert Mundy: Yes Adam it\u2019s just for the same reasons you know that Mark mentioned and Tom just touched on as well. And not that dissimilar from a paper you put out not that long ago about this thing can turn really quickly. And if it does or our supply chain or our - how our customers are impacted and all bets are off. But you know usually we have our crystal ball as not as cloudy.\nAdam Josephson: Right.\nRobert Mundy: So, we do the best we can, but these things can change so rapidly and if we have a number out there and that happens. It just, it's hard to recover from that because the perception is what people happen to read that day and they forget about you know that you tried to warn that you know things can change quickly.\nAdam Josephson: Yes.\nRobert Mundy: So it's just - to do it the way we're doing it right now.\nAdam Josephson: I appreciate. But just one last question Bob on the COVID costs are you expecting a similar level of COVID costs in 3Q and perhaps beyond or do you think those are?\nRobert Mundy: No.\nAdam Josephson: One-time in 2Q?\nRobert Mundy: No, I do not.\nOperator: Your next question - it's a follow-up from Mark Wilde.\nMark Wilde: Yes, I just I had a few kind of quick ones for you, the box shipment numbers that you gave up 1.2%. What was the impact of Richland on those numbers? And can you give us a sense of where Richland is producing right now?\nThomas Hassfurther: Mark I mean Richland obviously had an impact and you see we've got some puts and takes here too. I mean we closed the San Lorenzo. We've opened - the Richland, Richland has ramped up very nicely. I don't go into details as to exactly what they're running, but I will just say that we're pleased with what Richland\u2019s done. And obviously they made they made some contribution to that increase.\nMark Wilde: And then the second one, Tom any impact that you've seen so far from the dollar starting to weaken?\nThomas Hassfurther: Not at the moment, Mark.\nMark Wilde: And if it continues to weaken would you expect some particularly around sort of export volumes or export pricing?\nThomas Hassfurther: It could, I mean that's obviously currency is a big part of the export market. So, it can drive it up, drive it down drive prices one way or the other. So yes, depending on what happens. I still think it's in a range right now where it's not quite as impactful, but if it does drop some more that could definitely create a change.\nMark Wilde: And are you seeing any impact from the Brazilians being a little more aggressive. I mean they've got a very weak currency and extra capacity right now?\nThomas Hassfurther: Not right now. We're not seeing that right now. I can't, I mean that could change tomorrow, but I'm just giving you a snapshot as of right now.\nMark Wilde: Yes, that's all I'm looking for. The last one I had. Is it possible to get any sense of sort of what the economic slow back might have amounted to in Q2 or how much extra fuel you have in the tank potentially across the mill system?\nMark Kowlzan: We don't quantify that - you know in terms of what we did as far as running to demand it's obvious. We did using the term run to demand and what we saw happening if you think about is the second quarter was unfolding. In April folded into May and we saw some big businesses shutting down, the protein side of the business going down. We had to make some decisions in terms of what we believe, we would end up with. And so part of that decision making was to literally slowdown some of our machines and run to demand, not knowing where some of our output was going to have to go. But knowing that we could always ramp that back up, but there was some slowing down that took place in a few of our paper machines that caused us not to run full out. And I'd rather just leave it at that.\nMark Wilde: Yes, okay. And I guess just related to that Mark, it did sound to me like over time both the Ritter and Wallula, you had some ability to kind of stretch those conversions in terms of capacity over time, possible to get a sense of kind of where?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, Wallula has been a really great success for us. Essentially we're running the mill full out right now. The number two machine which has always been a medium machine is running to its limits, and then all of the work that was done to support number three machine. We've seen all of the success there, based on the grade mix we're running as far as a high performance grade mix, the mill has been through this year running to its capacity. That being said, with the OCC plant and the opportunity with some recycled fiber in the sheet, with some future capital spending, if we chose to, again we said this few years ago that there was probably depending on the grade mix you present the mill. It could be another 50,000 tons of opportunity coming out of that mill. But again, it would require a capital analysis and some decision making on whether or not that was the right thing to do. But right now, the mill is running at capacity and we're quite pleased with what it's doing.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Mr. Kowlzan, I see, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes thanks Shelby. Everybody, thank you so much for joining us today and stay well. We look forward to talking with you in October for the third quarter call. Have a nice day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. Demand for our corrugated products was very good in the second quarter, especially during the month of June. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new second quarter record for shipments per day which were up 1.2% compared to last year second quarter. Total shipments for the quarter were also up 1.2% over last year. As a comparison for the second quarter, the industry was down 1.4% in total and on a work day basis. Through the first half of 2020, our box shipment volume is up 2.5% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 0.6%. Outside sales volume of containerboard was about 10,000 tons below last year second quarter and 23,000 tons below the first quarter of 2020, as we ran our containerboard system to demand, supply the record needs of our box plants, and positioned our inventory for even higher demand during an expected stronger third quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.61 per share below the second quarter of 2019 and down $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2020. Export containerboard prices were down about $0.05 per share versus last year second quarter and flat compared to the first quarter of 2020. Finally, I'd like to point out that the benefits from our capital spending strategy in the box plants that we spoken about over the last couple of years are continuing to gain traction. As we have said many times this strategy of improving the technology and equipment in various plants, as well as the construction of new box plants is based upon our customer's needs and demands and improving our capabilities to grow with them. We're seeing this in our volume growth with new and existing customers, operating efficiencies and various operating and conversion cost areas. I'll now turn it back to Mark. No, and I agree with you. I mean and quite frankly I mean given our customer base and the way we operate, we're up for any uncertainty that comes along. Brian, this is Tom, I'll take that question. Of course we were up - we've been up the 2.5% as we talked about. We're building on that going into July. Our forecast will continue to build on that through the quarter and have a very good quarter providing. As Mark indicated earlier, we don't have some shutdowns as a result of the pandemic or anything like that, that occurs as long as the economy continues to open, I think the trends will be quite good. The comps do get a little easier as the quarter goes on. As I indicated, July was our largest increase last year. So things are pretty positive and I'll also add as I discussed on the last quarter call, the food service business had really been hurt quite badly and the Ag business that supplies the food service side had been hurt quite badly in the quarter. And that's beginning to come back now as restaurants open up and schools open up. We'll see more of that activity which is good, and the durables business has started to come back. And as you saw the durables numbers were quite good. So that's - those are good accelerators for us in the third quarter. Neel, this is Tom. I think our performance is really just you know where we're aligned with thousands of customers. We're still primarily local and regional, although we have a decent national footprint as well. And I think, we were fortunate to be able to grow with the customers that we have. In addition, we did pick up some new customers as well, just where the opportunities presented themselves. And you know it's kind of a continuation of what we do and what we do so well and the way we execute, and operate so efficiently, and it's also obviously a result of the capital that we talked about, that we invested in our businesses to be able to do that. So you know we had in \u2013 some cases, we had customers who were expanding and wanted to grow and wanted to grow with us, and you know we made the investments to be able to do that. So you know that's been our strategy for a long time and will continue to be our strategy. Well, as we talked about many times you know we don't have a large export footprint, but the one we do have is with long, long-term customers who have been in the business obviously you know and for a long time. And are good players in their marketplace. The demand has been relatively flat. The pricing had come down. It stayed flat for a while. And you know who knows what's going to happen down the road, I'm not going to speculate on that. But our demand on the export side has been steady and you know that's what we continue to expect and maybe even up a little depending on how things open up around the rest of the world. Yes Adam, the second part of your question, yes some of that does depend on the box business. You know if suddenly we had a big surge in the United States of COVID and we had certain businesses closed back down or big, big regions closed down. Some of those segments we talked about like food service that would be impacted. However, the indicators are that that's not going to be the case and that we've got the potential to continue to open up the economy. And if that takes place, we're quite bullish. The ups and downs, I think are when you say inventory restocking, I would say that most of our customers have kept their inventories at very low levels period. And so the surge is more demand-related than it is investor stocking-related and that requires because I can - you can really feel it in the short turnaround timeframes that we've got to - that we've got to produce the boxes. And this is what our customers are telling us likewise. So, they're sitting there with lower inventories, trying to manage their business, but also wanting to take advantage of every opportunity they have as this economy continues to open up. Mark I mean Richland obviously had an impact and you see we've got some puts and takes here too. I mean we closed the San Lorenzo. We've opened - the Richland, Richland has ramped up very nicely. I don't go into details as to exactly what they're running, but I will just say that we're pleased with what Richland's done. And obviously they made they made some contribution to that increase. Not at the moment, Mark. It could, I mean that's obviously currency is a big part of the export market. So, it can drive it up, drive it down drive prices one way or the other. So yes, depending on what happens. I still think it's in a range right now where it's not quite as impactful, but if it does drop some more that could definitely create a change. Not right now. We're not seeing that right now. I can't, I mean that could change tomorrow, but I'm just giving you a snapshot as of right now."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide more details, after which I'll wrap things up and then we'll be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $57 million or $0.59 per share, excluding the special items, second quarter 2020 net income of $132 million or $1.38 per share compared to the second quarter of 2019 net income of $194 million or $2.04 per share. Second quarter net income was $1.54 billion in 2020 and $1.76 billion in 2019. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter excluding special items was $299 million in 2020 and $376 million in 2019. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.79 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill associated with our Paper segment. Bob will discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Special items expenses also included the previously reported closure of our corrugated products facility in San Lorenzo California and costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Details of all special items for the second quarter of 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items that we mentioned, the $0.66 per share decrease in second quarter 2020 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our packaging segment of $0.66, and paper segment $0.05, lower volumes in our paper segment $0.40, and higher depreciation expense $0.04. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.33 primarily in the areas of labor infringes, repairs, materials and supplies and several fixed cost areas. We also have lower annual outage expenses of $0.10, lower converting costs $0.03, lower freight expenses $0.02, and other costs $0.01. Looking at our packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter of 2020 of $313 million with sales of $1.4 billion resulted in a margin of 22% versus last year's EBITDA of $349 million and sales of $1.5 billion or 23% margin. We ran our containerboard mills to demand, built some much needed inventory from the historically low levels at the end of first quarter, and maintained the industry leading integration rate by supplying our box plants with the necessary containerboard to establish a new second quarter record for box shipments per day. We ended the second quarter with inventory still at the relatively low levels, but in adequate position to meet our expected stronger third quarter demand. Our efficiencies and cost control at the mills in corrugated products facilities throughout the quarter were truly remarkable and we continue to see improvements in freight and logistics expenses through the optimization of our trucking operations in geographic footprint of our containerboard supply. I'll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on our containerboard sales in the Corrugated business. Thanks Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $5 million with sales of $123 million or a 4% margin compared to second quarter 2019 EBITDA of $48 million and sales of $238 million for a 20% margin. Second quarter paper prices and mix were about 5% below last year and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2020. As expected our sales volume was about 45% below last year and as announced back in April we had our Jackson mill down for the months of May and June to help manage our supply with our demand outlook. Unfortunately our view of demand as we approach the end of June did not improve to the point of allowing us to restart the mill resulting in us recently announcing that Jackson will also be down for the months of July and August. We'll continue to assess the market conditions for potential September restart of the mill. And I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. As in the first quarter, the employees at all of our manufacturing and office locations ran their operation safely in a very cost effective manner, while facing the unprecedented conditions brought on by COVID-19 pandemic. All facilities continued to operate in adherence to CDC guidelines and followed a strict protocol for workplace operations, as well as notification of in response to potential issues. Although we did experience some challenges during the second quarter, we have not experienced any material disruption in our operations or our supply chain due to the pandemic. The accomplishments by our employees during this period with the help of our customers and suppliers were truly amazing. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we will stay focused on preserving our financial and balance sheet strength during these uncertain times. We will remain well-positioned to manage whatever lies ahead while ensuring that we take care of the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders. During the unprecedented times, corrugated products demand has performed quite well so far this year and we expect a third quarter to be even stronger. We began the third quarter with replenished yet still relatively low containerboard inventories and our expectation is that we'll end the quarter at levels below where we started well managing scheduled outages at two of our mills. We've already announced the actions being taken in the paper business and we'll continue to evaluate the demand for our paper products throughout the third quarter. However shelter-in-place and lockdown conditions continue to change constantly across the country and such events and actions could adversely impact those expectations in the operations of not only our facilities, but also the availability of services and products we rely upon from our suppliers. As a result we are not able to appropriately quantify our guidance from third quarter. With that, I'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Shelby, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please. Let me comment and I'll let Bob comment also. Again you know the sales have picked up somewhat for cut-size. The problem is they haven't picked up enough that you can justify starting the mill and running full. And so it's not economical to do that. So we're running out of inventory and running out of what the I Falls Mill can produce. And the volume pickup we're seeing is what you'd expect with the reopening of various states and businesses, some of the back-to-school reordering, some of the big box stores planning on some of their volume that would be moving out into school activity. And so everything hinges on what truly happens to the economy in terms of how stable is this reopening and how fast does it occur et cetera. From the financials, Bob why don't you comment on what we'd expect to see?\nA \u2013Robert Mundy: Yes George I would think that you probably you know you're thinking about things correctly you know based on the assumptions we've made and that we've stated and if those hold true then I would think you're not you shouldn't be far off. Okay. George on the first part of your question regarding the impairment, impairment simply was a technical matter. And so, we went through the trigger analysis and it was truly just an SEC trigger requirement, you know non-cash charge cleans up the balance sheet. But don't forget, if you think about we've been operating our paper business for about eight years now, and the paper business has probably generated I'd estimate $1.1 billion of EBITDA during the time, it's been on a very good business for us. If you take this pandemic out of the picture, it's still you know is a good business. And so, who knows again how fast the economy recovers and demand recovers. Nevertheless, we have a lot of optionality in how we utilize the paper business and the assets within the paper business. Tom, do you want to talk about demand?\nA \u2013Thomas Hassfurther: Yes, as indicated George, currently we're starting out quite well in demand you know typical question that it gets asked is, where are we at this point in time through 17 days we're up just under 1%. And you know and that's against a very tough comp, a year ago I believe, we were up about 3.9% on a per workday basis. So, you know that's a good start to the quarter. You know you asked a question about our customers and are - what are their effects from the $600 or the potential effects from the $600 unemployment. I think most of that we've got some customers who are concerned about getting employees back, because in some cases they are making more money probably on unemployment than they would be working. But there I think for the most part people want to work and they want to get back to work. And so our customers that are continue to grow they expect to continue to bring their employees back. We have total flexibility and optionality with the Jackson assets and anybody that knows us would have to assume that we have studied all potential options and we have as we've done, as an example at Wallula into Ritter. We could take those assets if need be and you know apply them to a containerboard, if need be. But in the meantime, we don't see that happening. Again, there is always a capital cost and capital varies from mill asset to mill asset. But to your point, the big machine at a Jackson is one of the biggest cut size uncoated machines in North America. So, it's a really good paper machine and the mill you know in general is a very good mill asset. So again, it's got tremendous optionality for the future and - but just keep in mind that you know if anybody is thinking that you just convert it tomorrow think about all of the capital that it's you know we have employed over the years to bring on the efficiencies at a mill like Wallula, it doesn't happen overnight, and there's a phased approach. But again you know I am betting on the fact that, demand will pick up for the paper business and we'll see that come back. I think the best choice is that we continue to make the smaller bolt-on acquisitions on the box plant side of the business. Highly accretive opportunities that would come along, we would certainly be in a position to take those on and put them in the portfolio. That's always the primary driver and then we'll always figure out where we're going to supply containerboard into that system. If the high class problem arose that we had more demand than the capability to produce, we've got the optionality on how we go about our short-term and long-term, short-term we could buy tons on the outside market, long-term, we could figure out how to produce them internally. And so, I think it still holds, we have no desire to go offshore with any investment. We will stay in the lower 48 states as seen in our volume year-to-date in our volume in the second quarter. Our very diverse customer base pays-off quite well for us in terms of what we can service across the United States and our customers recognize that. So, we will continue to invest in the existing asset base to enhance the capability. And that - quite frankly that's our highest return opportunity right now is to continue to allow Tom and the box plants to reinvest in their capabilities we've been doing over the last couple of years. And we've seen tremendous results from that. No, I think again everything we've been doing over the last couple of years to simplify our portfolio in terms of our containerboard inventory - the SKUs what Tom uses in terms of the basis weights and we've gone primarily to a high performance mix of containerboard that we use. We keep that internal with our nationwide logistics capability and regional supply. We've been able to minimize the inventory requirements there. As far as customer and uncertainties again, we can pretty well produce what we need we're in - not in the - again I don't see any problems in this third quarter that would be related to uncertainties. Tom, do you want to comment on where we are at I think what took place. Well again, I think you know with - based on demand, as the economy started opening up, we definitely saw some tightening up on both truck and rail. And so in some ways, we'll deal with that, that's a healthy sign. But again the fact is that with the diversified production portfolio nationwide, we can manage the logistics costs better than we've ever been able to do. And so, but - we are seeing some upward pressure. I'll talk to you more on that. No, no. No e-commerce is a good thing, it's a good thing for PCA and it's a good thing for the entire industry. And also as we see it continuing to grow and I think there's a big consumer shift that's already taken place and even as the economy opens. I think people will continue to participate in e-commerce category quite heavily. Mark, it's hard - think about the reason we want to pull this outage up is to take advantage of the fact that we have to take DeRidder down for part of its annual outage anyways and we're doing the DeRidder number one machine annual during that fourth quarter. And in the work we're doing on D1 we had recognized an opportunity to significantly upgrade the winder capability and go to a fourth set real automatic conveyor of reals into the winder back stance and really enhance the efficiencies of the machine. So, we have a very high return of capital project, which is taking a couple of weeks of downtime opportunity. We also recognize that the recovery boiler was going to be requiring a superheater replacement next year, which typically is in most cases about a three week outage type of job depending on the work, three weeks, three-and-a-half weeks of work. And we looked at it and said, well, we're going to take a longer outage on the big paper machine in the fall. And we know that within six months, you're going to have to take another longer outage that you know is the recovery boiler, which you know impacts cost. And we thought well, there are some uncertainties about the economy not knowing what demand is doing and where the world is going to be in the fourth quarter. We thought it was probably prudent to go ahead and pull up the outage, get the work done on the paper machine, get all of this work done on the recovery boiler, and put that behind us. And so, that without quantifying what that does to the annual shutdown cost next year, obviously, it eliminates that cost next year. And so, you not only eliminate that shutdown cost next year, but you see immediate results from the paper machine upgrade work and the reliability that you bring to bear with the boiler work that we're doing. So I don't want to try to quantify what that means for 2021s maintenance outage expenses. No it's probably once a decade type of opportunity in the superheaters you know quite frankly superheaters you change out probably every 25 years. But you typically it varies to work you're doing on a power boiler or a recovery boiler. The most complex work you do would be work such as a generator suction tubes and or a superheater suction tubes. In this case, we felt it was prudent to just go ahead and move this up, take advantage of this and there was no reason to wait. But it costs us. But it's an boiler would cost for next year. You know as again you would have to believe that we have in our files a various listing of opportunities and the costs of those opportunities and what could be done in that over what period of time. That being said if you look at our history over the last three decades whenever we've done big projects and big conversions we do it in phases. I don't want to try to quantify what that cost would be. It's not proper to do that, but it is a significant cost. I'll leave it at that. To do it right, to do it properly, it would be a significant cost, but if that were to play out that way that would mean that we have a significant opportunity. Yes. Debbie, on the first part of the question. The only board we buy on the outside right now currently is specialty type grade white top would be a good example. And then there is some specialty products that we use. That's essentially what we've been buying for the last couple of years. As far as in the fourth quarter with the outage, obviously, we got some flexibility in as we go through the third quarter and we look at what the fourth quarter end looks like. We'll figure out how we run the system. We've got great opportunities, we could and in a worst high-class situation, you could go by some board on the outside market, if you had to. But we're not anticipating that right now. So, it just requires us to manage our business well as we go into the month of October and November. Would fiber costs in general we're seeing flat, I mean, there is nothing. It's typically what you'd see with weather-related phenomenon and on seasonal-related phenomena with tied to weather events, but nothing unusual. Regarding the project we're still on schedule to the end of the year and it hasn't changed our view in the entire premise and investing the money into a new OCC plant in Wallula was to provide complete optionality of fiber opportunities in that mill. That mill if you can imagine being in the Pacific Northwest is the highest wood cost basket for paper mills in North America. And so, having the ability to utilize OCC and various wood fibers gives us the optionality we need there. So it's still something we would believe is a good thing to do and important thing to do to fiber that mill up for the future. So it hasn't changed our outlook on where we are. We don't quantify that - you know in terms of what we did as far as running to demand it's obvious. We did using the term run to demand and what we saw happening if you think about is the second quarter was unfolding. In April folded into May and we saw some big businesses shutting down, the protein side of the business going down. We had to make some decisions in terms of what we believe, we would end up with. And so part of that decision making was to literally slowdown some of our machines and run to demand, not knowing where some of our output was going to have to go. But knowing that we could always ramp that back up, but there was some slowing down that took place in a few of our paper machines that caused us not to run full out. And I'd rather just leave it at that. Yes, Wallula has been a really great success for us. Essentially we're running the mill full out right now. The number two machine which has always been a medium machine is running to its limits, and then all of the work that was done to support number three machine. We've seen all of the success there, based on the grade mix we're running as far as a high performance grade mix, the mill has been through this year running to its capacity. That being said, with the OCC plant and the opportunity with some recycled fiber in the sheet, with some future capital spending, if we chose to, again we said this few years ago that there was probably depending on the grade mix you present the mill. It could be another 50,000 tons of opportunity coming out of that mill. But again, it would require a capital analysis and some decision making on whether or not that was the right thing to do. But right now, the mill is running at capacity and we're quite pleased with what it's doing. Yes thanks Shelby. Everybody, thank you so much for joining us today and stay well. We look forward to talking with you in October for the third quarter call. Have a nice day. Bye-bye."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations for the second quarter was $227 million with free cash flow of $146 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $81 million, common stock dividends of $75 million, net interest payments of $41 million, and cash taxes of $39 million. We ended the quarter with $853 million of cash on hand or $977 million including marketable securities. Our liquidity yet June 30 was just over $1.3 billion. During the second quarter, uncoated freesheet market conditions and especially demand for our cut-size office paper products continue to deteriorate rapidly arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. These conditions along with the estimated impact on our paper segment and its projected future results of operations resulted in a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill and the long-lived assets within our Paper segment. Due to this triggering event and a more likely than not assessment that an impairment of goodwill occurred, an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020 was performed. Based on this evaluation, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the Paper segment and recognized a non-cash impairment charge totaling $55.2 million. The impairment charge is not tax deductible. We also performed a recoverability test on the long-lived assets within our Paper segment, including long-lived intangible assets, as of May 31, 2020. The results of this test indicated that these assets were 100% recoverable. Lastly, we are planning to take a - or to make a change to the scheduled outages in our containerboard meals for the fourth quarter of this year versus what we discussed during last quarter's call. Our current plans are to pull forward some recovery borrow work at the DeRidder mill from next year to eliminate the risk of unscheduled downtime and during this period, perform a high return capital project on the number one paper machine real section. The fourth quarter estimate for a scheduled outages is now $0.59 per share and the full year estimate is now a $1.05 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Well, Brian, when George asked a question earlier I think it sort of gave an indication that there are some things that are positive certainly on the volume side. But there will be some seasonal cost that that can go the other way. So all things being equal, we would - if based on our assumptions it should be we would expect it to be fairly similar. There's also some mix things and we talked about freight just from a mix perspective like freight as an example. It's not that, there's a little bit of upward pressure, but there's also I guess some mix related things that cause freight cost to go up from 2Q to Q3 some of that would be like for my pause in our paper business we have to still get some paper down in the part of the country that we have the mill down. So things like that and there's some things going on, on the containerboard side you know drive that up. As well as certainly, energy usage during this part of the - this time of the year is a lot higher and our outages based on the numbers we gave you on guidance you know outages. If you look at what we've said that's $0.07 a share so right there so. Yes Adam it's just for the same reasons you know that Mark mentioned and Tom just touched on as well. And not that dissimilar from a paper you put out not that long ago about this thing can turn really quickly. And if it does or our supply chain or our - how our customers are impacted and all bets are off. But you know usually we have our crystal ball as not as cloudy. So, we do the best we can, but these things can change so rapidly and if we have a number out there and that happens. It just, it's hard to recover from that because the perception is what people happen to read that day and they forget about you know that you tried to warn that you know things can change quickly. So it's just - to do it the way we're doing it right now. No. No, I do not."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. Again, I\u2019m Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin our prepared remarks relative to the first quarter performance, I want to take a few make a few comments about the pandemic crisis in PCA. Without a doubt, these may be the most unpredictable and unprecedented times that hopefully we will ever encounter.There is no reference manual for managing through a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications, such as what has occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our routines, habits, personal preferences, work and social activity and many other aspects of our lives are sure to change forever as a result of this.PCA\u2019s operations qualify as an essential or critical element under the various state and local shelter-in-place orders. Our leadership team is in constant communication discussing safety, the state of our operations, business continuity and other critical management topics.It is our responsibility at PCA to ensure that, first and foremost, we help provide for the well-being of our more than 15,000 employees and their families. We must do everything in our power to assist our customers and suppliers as well.We have implemented various procedures and safeguards at all our manufacturing, converting and office locations across the country to help keep our employees safe and healthy as we provide the goods and services considered essential for assisting with our country\u2019s response to the pandemic.We have also put measures in place to assist them with the economic ramifications that have resulted from these response measures. To date, we have not experienced any significant interruptions at our operations or in our supply chain due to the virus.Our network of mills, converting facilities and distribution operations strategically located throughout the United States gives PCA asset flexibility to manufacture and ship products to multiple locations.We will continue to closely monitor developments, take proactive measures to protect our employees, and provide our customers with the products and services they require.I could not be more proud of the effort, responsiveness and sacrifices displayed by all PCA employees, as well as our customers and suppliers. It has truly been an inspiring observation.I\u2019ll now begin with an overview of the first quarter results, and then I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who\u2019ll provide more details. I\u2019ll then wrap things up, and we\u2019ll be glad to take some questions.Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $142 million or $1.49 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.01 per share, related primarily to costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.Excluding special items, first quarter 2020 net income was $143 million or $1.50 per share compared to the first quarter of 2019 net income of $187 million or $1.98 per share.First quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $311 million in 2020 and $371 million in 2019. Details of the special items for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release.Excluding special items, the $0.48 per share decrease in first quarter 2020 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.64 and Paper segment of $0.05, lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.03, higher annual outage expenses, $0.04, higher depreciation expense, $0.04, other expenses, $0.01, and higher tax rate, $0.01.The items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.14, lower operating costs of $0.09, lower converting costs, $0.04, lower freight and logistics costs, $0.01, and lower interest expense, $0.04, and non-operating pension expense, $0.02.The results were $0.30 above the first quarter guidance of $1.20 per share, primarily due to higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.03 and our Paper segment of $0.01, higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment of $0.02 and lower operating costs of $0.15, resulting from the excellent fiber and energy usage and lower input prices in our mills.Freight and logistics costs were lower than expected by $0.03, as were converting costs, annual outage costs and other expenses, each lower than expectations by $0.02 per share.Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2020 of $290 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year\u2019s EBITDA of $334 million and sales of $1.5 billion or a 23% margin.Our containerboard mills established a new first quarter volume record, even while performing scheduled annual maintenance outage work at four of the mills. Our containerboard production allowed us to maintain our industry-leading integration rate of approximately 95% by supplying the necessary containerboard to our box plants, who achieved an all-time record for total box shipments, as well as a new first quarter shipments per day record.We were able to meet this greater-than-anticipated demand through proactive management, changing the sequencing of our scheduled maintenance outages, as well as outstanding execution of the work performed during these outages.Our enhanced capabilities to optimize the mix, freight and logistics costs, inventory levels and internal and external customer needs of the customer - of the containerboard system provided to us by our machine conversion at Wallula Mill were a key component as well.We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories at their lowest levels since the acquisition of Boise\u2019s packaging business in 2013.I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom, who\u2019ll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugating business.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. Corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new all-time record for total box shipments, which were up 5.6% over last year as well as a new first quarter record in shipments per day, which were up 3.9% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.Outside sales volume of containerboard was 13% above last year\u2019s first quarter, primarily attributable to increased domestic demand with export demand slightly higher as well.Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.54 per share below the first quarter of 2019 and down $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Export containerboard prices were down about $0.10 per share versus last year\u2019s first quarter and flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of $42 million with sales of $217 million or 19% margin compared to the first quarter of 2019 EBITDA of $55 million and sales of $240 million or 23% margin.First quarter paper prices and mix were below last year as expected, however, they were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Paper volume was also lower as expected, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill, however, it was about 3% higher than we had assumed.Although we ended the quarter with our inventory slightly lower than planned, on April 1, we announced downtime at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the months of May and June to ensure we manage the supply according to our demand outlook for the second quarter.Throughout the quarter, the mills did an outstanding job, managing fiber and chemical usage and maintained tight control over indirect and fixed expenses.I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. We had record first quarter cash generation with cash provided by operations of $237 million and record first quarter free cash flow of $166 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $71 million and common stock dividends of $75 million.We ended the quarter with $764 million of cash on hand or $913 million, including the cash we recently moved to marketable securities. Our liquidity at March 31 of over $1.2 billion is the highest ever for our company. And with the refinancing we completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have no debt maturities for the next 3.5 years.Regarding our announcement of taking our paper mill in Jackson, Alabama down for the months of May and June, our estimated second quarter financial impact of this decision is approximately $30 million or $0.24 per share.I want to update you on our full year guidance for certain items that we provided on last quarter\u2019s call. As Mark alluded to earlier, we managed through a very strong first quarter demand in our Packaging business, partly by altering the sequencing of the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills, as well as the containerboard machines impacted versus what we discussed during last quarter\u2019s call. There are no changes to the scheduled outages at our white paper mills.The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.22 per share, and the estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.09 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.34 per share in the fourth quarter. The full year estimate remains at $0.81 per share, as we mentioned previously.Also, our full year interest expense is now expected to be $88 million versus $81 million. And our net cash interest is now estimated to be $92 million versus $84 million, primarily due to lower expected interest income.Our cash tax rate estimate is now slightly lower than our earlier estimate of 19%, partially due to the downtime we announced at our Jackson mill, and our effective tax rate remains at approximately 25%.After a thorough review of our capital spending plans, we are not changing the range of spending we provided previously, which was between $400 million to $425 million, nor are we changing our full year outlook for pension contributions or depreciation.I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. I want to reiterate the comments I made in yesterday\u2019s earnings release. As I mentioned earlier, these may be the most unpredictable and unprecedented times that hopefully we will ever encounter. Not a day passes that we realize something new being impacted in a way we had never thought of or imagined of before.Our consistent approach towards prudent capital allocation and sound financial governance has served us well for many, many years and is certainly helpful in times like this.PCA entered this uncertain period of time brought on by the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial and balance sheet strength. Our focus has been and will remain on preserving that strength through the actions and decisions we make as a management team.As Bob mentioned, our company\u2019s liquidity position has never been higher nor has our confidence in the future success of PCA. We are well positioned to manage through whatever lies ahead, while ensuring we take care of the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.However, the confidence does not translate to the same degree short-term predictability or guidance specifics that we normally provide at this time. Bob has provided you an update on estimates for certain forward-looking items.However, due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and the timing of the global recovery and economic normalization, we\u2019re not able to properly quantify our guidance for the second quarter.We\u2019ve already announced the actions being taken in our Paper business, and we believe these actions will position us properly for what we anticipate right now for the second half of 2020. However, nothing is certain, especially now, and it may require further action to be taken. We know that we experienced a demand surge in our Packaging business in the first quarter, and the second quarter has also begun quite strong as well.Our containerboard inventory is at the lowest levels, both in total and in weeks of supply since our acquisition of the Packaging business from Boise. And while recycled fiber prices began moving significantly higher during the first quarter, our position as a primarily virgin fiber producer minimizes its impact compared to other producers.However, it only makes logical sense that demand in certain end markets will return to more normal growth trends at some point, although we\u2019ve been successful at securing new business in end markets with a stronger demand outlook versus markets whose demand may be impacted more negatively.Also, it is impossible to predict what additional health-related measures will be or must be taken or dictated to us by the various state and local governments where we operate. Such events and actions could adversely impact the operation of not only our facilities, but also the availability of services and products we rely upon from our suppliers.That being said, it is also a fact that the products our company provides are essential to the response efforts, the recovery and the well-being of our country. The needs for our cost-effective, sustainable and renewable products will continue.While no one knows the severity or longevity of the virus\u2019 impact on global economy, it is my belief that this need will be even more in demand as the world recovers from this crisis.With that, we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we\u2019ve made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.And with that, Shelby, I\u2019d like to go ahead and open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks for all you\u2019re doing on COVID and congratulations on the quarter. I guess if you could give a little bit more color on what was particularly positive on the operating side relative to your guidance going into the quarter.You mentioned - I think you mentioned fiber and fuel, but if you could, to the extent possible, comment a bit further there, that would be great. I had a couple of follow-ons.\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah. George, when we started the first quarter in January, we were looking at taking four of the mills down for their annual outages. And obviously, there is a lot of unknowns there. After the work was done, starting up the mills, all the mills started up remarkably well ahead of schedule and are running flawlessly since. So that was a big positive for us.And also, in doing so, the utilization of energy and other raw materials flows through. We\u2019ve been - you would understand that with energy costs coming down, we were able to take advantage of lower energy pricing. And then again, just good efficient utilization of fiber and conversion in the mills.But again, just very well executed annual outages and utilization of the assets. And the same thing we\u2019re seeing in the box plant side of the business, in the converting side. Bob, you want to add something to that?\nRobert Mundy: Yeah. George, I\u2019ll just add. Part of what Mark was referring to and what we commented on earlier was on fiber end. Even though OCC prices were rising throughout the quarter, us being primarily virgin and with the woodyard project that we completed last summer at Counce, we saw significant usage and pricing benefit from that project, as well as other parts of the country. But Counce was a big part of that project we talked about around this -late summer last year.\nMark Kowlzan: I mean, to emphasize that, George, we\u2019re running Counce. Counce has essentially 1,000 ton a day recycling capability with OCC and DLK. And for all intents and purposes, we\u2019re not and we have not been using recycled fiber at Counce, it\u2019s all virgin pine.\nGeorge Staphos: Understood. Thank you for that additional color. I guess, I had two additional questions and then, for fairness, I\u2019ll turn it over. One, can you comment on what you are seeing in the first portion of the second quarter? What are your customers saying about the degree to which they think this volume pickup will be sustained into the second quarter? Recognize there are no guarantees with any of this, so we totally appreciate that.And then on the inventory side, are you comfortable with the level of inventories where they\u2019re at, recognizing they\u2019re lowest they\u2019ve been since the Boise acquisition? Or it\u2019s great that they\u2019ve gotten this low, but you\u2019re uncomfortable with it and you need to rebuild inventory, if in fact demand would allow you to do that in the first place? Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Tom, let me start off with the inventory question, and then I\u2019ll let you take the first part. As far as inventories go, obviously, I wish we had some extra cushion, but it is what it is. It\u2019s also a high-class problem when you have to run as efficient and hard as we are doing. I found over the decades that our mills run better when they are under duress, shall I say, and there\u2019s a challenge.But no, it\u2019s quite impressive that we are running extremely lean in the inventories. But as you could expect, our 95 box plants nationwide have supported one another. There were times during the last couple of months that we\u2019ve shifted some inventory from one box plant to another to support the needs of their sister box plants.And again, having the full capability of the Wallula mill operating over the last year, that\u2019s given us tremendous flexibility and this whole logistics capability to support the nationwide footprint.So more than ever, having the mill system that we have allows us to run very efficiently even at the new low inventory levels. So - and Tom, why don\u2019t you go ahead and answer the first part of that question on where we are in the marketplace?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes. Okay. I\u2019d just add, Mark, on the inventory side, one thing that\u2019s really helped us also is the availability of transportation, so that, as this economy really begins to open up and if that becomes under a little more duress, that may impact some of our decisions inventory wise. But as Mark said, it\u2019s amazing. We\u2019re able to run at this inventory rate.Let me just comment a little bit on your first question, George, relative to the customers and kind of what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m just going to give you a quick synopsis, a little bit of what took place, as we saw it in the first quarter and what we see going into the second quarter. Obviously, the first quarter was incredibly busy, high demand, driven primarily by e-commerce and, of course, food and beverage on the retail side of the business.We alluded to the fact that we expect in the second quarter to return to more normalized growth rates, which is what we\u2019re seeing right now. So there has been a more normalization of the pattern, if you will, of demand.However, going into the quarter, as some of the food service sector begins to open up, we expect to see some return of demand in that particular arena. So I would just comment that going forward, as we alluded to in our comments, we\u2019re much more on track for that normalized growth pattern, which is in that 1.5% to 2% range.\nGeorge Staphos: All right. Thank you very much.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Of course. Your next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal.\nMark Wilde: Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Bob, Tom.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nRobert Mundy: Hey, Mark.\nMark Wilde: Mark, I wondered - you mentioned this integration rate in containerboard up to 95% now. I\u2019m just curious about what your options are for adding more mill capacity on the existing base? I think you\u2019ve had some - maybe some opportunities at Wallula. I don\u2019t know where you stand with those, maybe opportunities at other mills?\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah. Mark, as we talked about in the January call, at this essentially full integration we were at that 95% back two years ago to three years ago. We consider that full integration. We\u2019re still selling a little bit out in the open market, a very small amount, going offshore to export. So we do have the ability to pull some of that in over time if that dictates. We do have some room to continue to stretch Wallula as time goes on with some capital investment. And so that hasn\u2019t changed.But I think the bigger story will be, as it was back a few years ago, that we\u2019ll now have to look out and in a much, much broader sense of how we prepare the business for the next three to five years in terms of our containerboard supply.Shorter period of time, we can do what we did a few years ago and buy tons on the open market as we prepare for this future. But we do have some opportunities. We talked about that in the past. And so I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Nothing\u2019s changed. But we feel we\u2019re in a really, really good position right now. And we\u2019re very comfortable with that.\nMark Wilde: Okay. And just a couple of quick follow-ons for Tom Hassfurther. Tom, I wondered if you can just comment on whether you\u2019ve felt any impact in the quarter from some of the mill outages that have taken place elsewhere in containerboard?And then I wondered if you could also just talk about sort of growth runway for PCA in the converting business. You\u2019ve always been a little more niche focused. You\u2019re becoming a bigger and bigger part of the industry. What does the forward runway look like?\nThomas Hassfurther: Mark, the mill outage impact, I mean, we managed around it, let\u2019s just put it that way. There were some trades that were in place that were impacted, that we had to take care of either through our mill system or through other trade partners. So we did incur some additional transportation expenses.But for the most part, again, it kind of goes back to the commentary around inventory, is that\u2019s remarkable how well we did given the circumstances and given the demand that we had in the first quarter and the very short lead times we had to meet. So overall, I mean, it\u2019s just - it was just a great team performance.The growth runway, we\u2019ve - as you see in our capital investments and what we\u2019ve talked about and whether it\u2019s building a new plant at a Richland or a Marshfield, we\u2019ll continue to be guided by our customer demand in those regions of the country, and we\u2019ll continue to provide those opportunities for growth as we see.I\u2019ve said all along, I say, we\u2019re not a build it and hope they will come. We secure the business and then go out and invest the capital. So - and we\u2019ll continue to do that. So I see our growth runway as being very positive. And again, it will be dictated by our customers as much as anything else.\nMark Wilde: Okay, very good. Good luck in the rest of year.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Mark. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Connelly of Stephens.\nMark Connelly: Thanks. Mark, your inventory performance last quarter was pretty stunning, and now they\u2019re down again. How much of that is sustainable? And how much is just sort of dealing with the surge you had to deal with?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, if you look at our plans for the first quarter, we knew we were going to be pushing the envelope on that lower end of the inventory because of the annual outages. We go through that every year to one degree or another. But obviously, with demand strong through the fourth quarter and then demand stronger than we anticipated in the first quarter, we really had to execute well through that period of shutdown time.Now the shutdowns are behind us. The mills are all running well. So we\u2019re able to continue to place tons into our system where we need to. Obviously, we don\u2019t have a lot of extra capacity. And I\u2019ll use the term, we don\u2019t have a lot of margin for error, the mills have to continue to run well now.We have our next planned outage in September at the Tomahawk mill, and then Filer City has no outage this year. We\u2019ll have the No. one machine down in Counce later in the fall, but that will be it.So we have the remainder of May through the summer months into the September period to run well and build up some extra tons where we need to place them within the system.\nMark Connelly: Okay. And then just one more question. When I look at your revenue per ton performance, I didn\u2019t see any of the negative impact that I was or much of the negative impact that I was expecting from the January price cut. Is that consistent with your view? Or did you - do you feel like you sell what you\u2019re supposed to see? Or are we going to see a catch-up in Q2?\nRobert Mundy: Yes. Mark, it\u2019s Bob. I\u2019d say we saw what we were expecting, certainly some mix component to some of that, but it was about what we were expecting.\nMark Connelly: Okay. So its sound, looking at next. Very good. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Maguire: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So just a question on - I think in the release, you talked about sources of upside to the $1.20 guidance. One was better mix and price. Just wondering if you could kind of comment a little bit on that. I think Tom was just alluding to it, but wondering about mix and then just within that sort of the volume trends by end market. I think you talked about e-commerce and supermarkets being a little bit better, but wonder if there\u2019s any other end markets that you started to see some weakness as the quarter dragged on, so just kind of mix in general for both pricing and volume there?\nMark Kowlzan: Tom, why don\u2019t you go ahead and handle it.\nThomas Hassfurther: Yeah. Let\u2019s talk about the volume trends first, and then we\u2019ll get back to the mix side of it. But on the volume trends, as I said, the e-commerce and the food and beverage on the retail side in the first quarter, obviously, with some of the panic buying and some of the other things and, of course, consumers quickly changing from going to restaurants regularly to now being at home and to not being travelling or any of those other sorts of things, so that side of the business, I mean, really, really was very, very robust.The food service side of the business, on the other hand, which would be restaurants, hotels, airlines, conventions, all the other - stadiums, all those other areas of food service, that was down dramatically and has and stayed down throughout the quarter. I think they\u2019re seeing some signs of and hope of rebound, obviously, going into the second quarter as the economy begins to open up some.On the ag side of the business, of course, it\u2019s a mixed bag also. You had those ag industries that support the retail side, did very well, those ag industries that support food service. In some cases, we\u2019re applying produce under the fields.The auto sector has been \u2013 has obviously been under some duress. I\u2019m talking about aftermarket, primarily. And then, of course, at the towards the end of the quarter, we had some we began to see some weakness on the protein side, meat and pork specifically. That\u2019s COVID related. Lot of things going on in the plants, 2-week shutdowns, things like that, that have gone on in some of those processing plants. So and we expect that to begin to come back.In terms of better mix and price, I mean, on the mix side, yes, the brown volume has been very good, again, driven by that e-com and that food and beverage side. But on the other hand, the display side of the business, the point of purchase display has been relatively weak, and we expect that to remain somewhat weak throughout the remainder of the year.\nBrian Maguire: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that color. And then just to switch to the paper side of the business. Demand there seems like it\u2019s maybe rebounded a little bit in March for whatever reason, but we\u2019re all expecting a pretty big drop in April with all the offices and schools shut. I don\u2019t know if you can comment on trends you\u2019re seeing there.And I think in the release you said that the Jackson outage, you think, will be enough to take care of what you\u2019re expecting for volumes, but things do continue to come in weaker. Does that just extend the duration of that outage into 3Q, if needed?\nMark Kowlzan: I think everything we\u2019re seeing is what the - what has been reported in the public. The percentage of falloff of demand is pretty close to what the indexes have been indicating. If you would imagine that starting in March, all the school systems throughout North America started to shut down at from the university level down to the kindergarten level. Businesses were sending everybody home to work from home, shelter in place. So there was that big immediate fall off in demand for paper.What we saw a little bit happening through March into somewhat into the early part of April was that there were some channels and some outlets that were still stocking. People\u2019s buying habits changed, people that went home, businesses that were now operating in a different manner were sourcing their cut size, reprographic paper is an example, from different supplies. But we\u2019ve definitely seen the falloff. Now, here is the end of April. And again, I would just refer you to what the publications are saying with demand.Now that being said, with talk about reopening various sectors of the economy in the United States, you could imagine if school systems come back up and run into the fall, schools will be reordering. Businesses that come back up will be continuing to reorder paper as time goes on.So we think where we are, we put ourselves in a good position to manage the inventory. We can manage that up and down. We have that flexibility. And so I\u2019m very comfortable with how and what we\u2019re doing in the paper side of the business in managing to the demand.\nBrian Maguire: Okay. The plan at the moment, though, is to restart Jackson, correct?\nMark Kowlzan: Correct.\nBrian Maguire: Okay. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.\nRandy Toth: Good morning, guys. This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nRandy Toth: Over the \u2013 good morning. Over the past couple of quarters, you\u2019ve built a sizable war chest in anticipation of potential economic uncertainty and with nearly $1 billion of cash on hand and the uncertainty now here, how are you thinking about capital allocation? And has the tone of conversations within your M&A pipeline changed at all? If any color there, would be helpful.\nMark Kowlzan: I remember a year ago, in January, I was asked the question when I - I think we probably had $300 and some odd million of cash, and there were some individuals that thought that was a high number. And then we went into the second, third quarter of the year when cash is building up. And I remember the July call last year, when we were somewhere in that $500 million level, and someone asked me, didn\u2019t I think that was too high. And I said, no, I\u2019d let them know when I thought it was too high. Here we are, approaching $1 billion, and I\u2019ll still use that and say, you never have enough cash, especially how I referred to it last year as we live in very uncertain times, well, this is about as uncertain as it gets.So I\u2019m very comfortable with the cash we have. We also are generating healthy cash as we go through this. The capital plans that we have in place are very business growth driven and efficiency driven, and so we feel very comfortable with continuing on with the capital allocation in that manner.And also, as we go forward, with this fortress quality balance sheet, it does give us an incredible opportunity to look at acquisition opportunities that come along and they could be highly accretive in the future. So we can do just about anything that makes sense in the future and go forward in a very comfortable manner.\nRandy Toth: Understood. Understood. And then could you just briefly talk about what you\u2019re seeing in April demand for both containerboard and paper, maybe versus March?\nMark Kowlzan: Tom, you want to talk about containerboard, I\u2019ll talk about paper?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yeah. The demand is still as I alluded to earlier, I mean we\u2019re returning to more of a normalized growth trend. So demand right now is running 1.5% to 2% in that category, both on paper and on boxes. So that\u2019s about - I\u2019m talking about linerboard medium here, not the paper side of the business.But - so that\u2019s about where we\u2019re running right now. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a much more normalized growth pattern, as we talked about. But I do see some positives as we open up this economy. There\u2019s some opportunities, I think, to improve that as the quarter goes on.\nMark Kowlzan: And then with regard to paper, primarily cut size, again, I\u2019m just going to refer you to what the publications are referring to and what they\u2019re anticipating for the second quarter right now. It seems to be holding up with their predictions of a downturn in demand.\nRandy Toth: Okay, understood. I\u2019ll hand it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Weintraub of Seaport Global.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, just clarifying, that 1.5% to 2% that\u2019s year-over-year, right, for containerboard and box demand as opposed to April v March? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what you meant?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, yes.\nMark Weintraub: The other just kind of following up a little bit on some of the comments about securing new business in well positioned end markets, et cetera. Maybe if you could provide a little bit more color, and is that additive business, are you trading up? And maybe more generally, if you could provide some thoughts as to the mix of your business, how it positions you in this environment overall?And with one question being, historically, you\u2019ve had more local account exposure than some of the other larger players, which are more nationally driven. How does that play out, do you think? Or are you seeing it play out in this type of environment?\nThomas Hassfurther: Mark, this is Tom. I\u2019ll just answer that real quick. We haven\u2019t changed our stripes at all in terms of the type of business we go after or the mix of business that we currently have. It served us very, very well. And I think served us incredibly well during the first quarter.I\u2019ll give you an example of the way we operate. We \u2013 at various times, I mean, you\u2019re going to win some business, you\u2019re going to lose some business, you\u2019re going to do some other things. And we happen to, coming into this year, lost a very sizable national account.That\u2019s been replaced with about, I don\u2019t know, 50 to 100 accounts, so which is our niche and more about how we do it. And that\u2019s an example of the hard to do. And of course, that positions us for a lot less risk going forward when that business is spread over a much larger customer base. It also allowed us growth opportunities within all those accounts that we just picked up. And that\u2019s I think that\u2019s the best description of the way we continue to operate and what makes us somewhat unique, I think, in terms of the larger players.\nMark Weintraub: Great. So - and are you - I completely understand your long-term strategy, and it\u2019s been incredibly successful for you, and I expect it will be going forward. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, in the current environment, are you seeing a difference? Are the local accounts performing differently at all than the larger national? Are they holding in better? Or they or is it more difficult for them? Or what - if there\u2019s any differentiation you can see, that would be great.\nThomas Hassfurther: I would say, Mark, that it\u2019s more of a mixed bag. Obviously, if you\u2019re big on the e-comm side, you\u2019re going to have very big and large growth, all right, which we\u2019ve participated in. Some of the smaller players there, they\u2019ve done well. Some of them haven\u2019t done as well.Some of the business I\u2019m talking about that perhaps was maybe negatively impacted in the first quarter through COVID and things like that, that chose to close will be reopening coming into the second quarter. So I think there\u2019s some opportunity there. But again, it\u2019s - I think on a macro basis, it\u2019s - there\u2019s a lot of give and take there.\nMark Weintraub: Got it. And also, order of magnitude, how much of your business would you say is directly or indirectly going into food service, which obviously was hit hard, but maybe is starting to see some recovery now?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, we don\u2019t really break out our actual segments and how much of those sales are. But we do have a sizable amount that does go into food service. And that was very negatively impacted, obviously. And we expect it to come back, but it\u2019s going to come back slowly. I mean I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any return to what we used to consider normal in the short run. It\u2019s going to take a little while to get there.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo Securities.\nGabe Hajde: Good morning. Thank you gentlemen, for taking my question. Mark, I was curious, you mentioned it in your prepared remarks as well as in the press release and talking about demand coming back, maybe even a little bit better than it was before the crisis. And I\u2019m curious if you can elaborate on that comment.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, using that, you have to qualify the time that it takes to get there. And I would expect that for PCA, in particular, we\u2019re an American-based company. We do, again, a small amount of containerboard sales offshore, but we don\u2019t have operations. We produce and sell into the United States with our corrugated products and our paper, primarily here, again, in the United States, a little bit into Canada.But nevertheless, we do believe that we will come back strong as a country, and it\u2019s still the best place to be in the world. And so the caveat is it\u2019s just there\u2019s some time it\u2019s going to take to get there, but I still feel very good that we\u2019re in the right place in the world and in the right products. And we\u2019ve got the platform to take advantage of that.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And then maybe, I guess we\u2019ve tried to come out in a couple of different ways on the end markets that you guys serve in the corrugated business. But is there a way that you can give us to think about corrugated intensity for the food beverage that goes through retail versus food service? Intuition would tell me that it\u2019s more intensive to go through the retail channel, but something that you guys have observed through time and a way to think about it?\nMark Kowlzan: Tom?\nThomas Hassfurther: Gabe, let me see if I can take a crack at this. I\u2019m not sure exactly what you\u2019re after. But on the food and beverage retail side, there\u2019s there are two distinctive markets really per se, okay? There\u2019s the - there\u2019s that retail side and then there\u2019s that food service side. And what we\u2019ve - what I\u2019ve learned even through this process from some of our end customers is how unique and different they are.It\u2019s almost like tissue. I mean tissue on the there\u2019s tissue on the retail side, and then there\u2019s tissue on the institutional side. And they\u2019re two completely different businesses and really different products. So you can\u2019t just swing from one to the other. And the same is very true even in the food business and especially related to the ag side of the food business, where you\u2019ve got agricultural accounts that primarily serve the food and beverage retail side.And then you\u2019ve got ag accounts that serve the food service side. And they don\u2019t swing from one to the other. They\u2019re just - they have completely different product lines and supply lines. So that\u2019s one of the big distinctions that we\u2019ve seen here, is that we - obviously, in Q1, we had tremendous demand on that retail side just to keep store shelfs stocked.Now as we get into the second quarter, third quarter and go on and the economy begins to open up, we - the food service side will begin to pick back up. That will and the retail side will come down a little bit. But overall, the net effect of that will be an increase, probably a slight increase in demand, not a decrease in demand.\nGabe Hajde: Okay, thanks.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.\nAdam Josephson: Morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are well.\nMark Kowlzan: Morning. Thank you.\nRobert Mundy: Same to you.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks. Tom, just one on back to the box demand trends for a moment. So if April is back to kind of a normal trend, I guess my question is, why not provide guidance in that case? Is it something you\u2019re thinking may happen in May and June that you haven\u2019t seen yet? Or is it something perhaps in your backlog for May that you\u2019re seeing? I\u2019m just - because, obviously, you normally provide current quarter guidance. And in this case, you\u2019ve opted not to do so. And you\u2019ve expressed the plan for Paper, taken Jackson mill taking the Jackson mill down for two months.So I\u2019m just trying to understand what kind of drove the decision not to provide guidance if, in fact, your box demand trend seems to be holding up pretty well at the moment?\nMark Kowlzan: Adam, there\u2019s zero upside in us providing any guidance because of the uncertainty that we still live with day to day. Anybody that turns on the TV or watches the news or checks your Internet messaging, what\u2019s coming out of Washington, what\u2019s coming out of the state and local levels is anybody\u2019s guess from day-to-day and hour-to-hour, the Paper business, the demands.So it\u2019s not even worth trying to put a number on that until we finally get some time behind us in terms of normalizing the economy. And so that\u2019s about as simple as it gets. There\u2019s still tremendous uncertainty day-to-day. And Bob, do you want to...\nRobert Mundy: Yes, just with - and Adam, as well, with suppliers and services and whatnot, we have no control over what may be going on there. So we can\u2019t be as confident in that we feel good where we are now. But the supply chain, things can happen, and it puts a lot of uncertainty out there.\nAdam Josephson: Sure. No, understood. And Mark, just on the free sheet business longer term. Obviously, you\u2019re managing supply now to match demand, and hopefully, things get better on the other side of this with respect to free sheet demand. But longer term, how are you viewing that business? Do you view it as really a cash cow, and you\u2019ve managed it quite successfully since you got it from Boise, and you\u2019ll continue to dothat? Or is it something that you may actually look to get bigger in if the price and opportunity is right?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, we\u2019ve said for seven years that the business has provided us a really good cash flow. We never had to invest an inordinate amount of capital. It\u2019s turned out to be a very good business in that regard. We\u2019ve made no - it is what it is. It is a declining business over time.The decline had flattened out somewhat. We would expect that decline to continue over time in a normalized manner. And at such point in time that it called for, we do have numerous opportunities to take advantage of these remaining assets. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that.\nAdam Josephson: Understood. Thanks so much Mark\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] George Staphos [Bank of America] has returned to the queue.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the follow-on. Mark, Tom, given what you\u2019ve seen over the last four to six weeks, maybe longer in terms of COVID and what it changed in terms of consumer demand, ordering patterns and the like, are there any directions, investments in converting, investments generally that you could sort of outline for us that may be now more important, higher priority, again, given what you\u2019ve seen over the last quarter or two? Thanks, guys. And good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Tom, why don\u2019t you go ahead with that?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, Number one is, I\u2019m going to reiterate this over and over again, no matter what call we\u2019re on, and that is that our investments are customer-driven. So we tend not to talk too much about that when we when the demand gets to a certain point and we need more capacity, we take care of that capacity, whether it\u2019s at a box plant or at a mill.And we - there\u2019s no question, the patterns have changed dramatically as a result of COVID. I think the patterns will be it\u2019s going to be a long time before the patterns get back to what I\u2019d call the normal that we used to understand, and we\u2019re going to have to adapt accordingly.One of the things that it does cause is it does - we could have - we can have tremendous demand in one region of the country or even a single plant and far less demand in some other plant. And therefore, we have to utilize our resources in a different way, which we do. And sometimes we incur additional cost as a result of doing that, but we take care of our customers.So we\u2019re just prepared to continue to do that. And we\u2019re prepared to look at the market through a very realistic lens and adapt to whatever change needs to take place. That\u2019s about the best I can summarize for you there, George.\nGeorge Staphos: Understood. Yes, I was getting really more about process than capacity, but I understand that that\u2019s something you don\u2019t want to get too deeply into. I mean, maybe as a follow-on and recognizing and you wouldn\u2019t be offended if I\u2019d say you\u2019re somewhat biased here. Do you think that the world we\u2019ve been living through in the last quarter or two has, I don\u2019t know, ultimately, long-term assisted, improved the growth outlook for corrugated because we\u2019re all going to be shopping from home to a larger degree, et cetera? Or you think this is more of a one-off and the longer-term secular will be what it was prior to COVID? Again, good luck for the quarter.\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, it\u2019s George, it\u2019s hard for me to speculate on that, but I would say that most of the trends are positive for corrugated, okay? Now on the other side of the equation, it\u2019s been a negative for OCC collection, obviously. And we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time talking about OCC, but it certainly has impacted OCC collection.Getting it from the consumer is a lot more difficult, and getting it from the food service sector or the retail sector. And I think that\u2019s going to be a trend that we\u2019re going to be dealing with for quite some time.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. And Shelby, I do believe there are no more questions.\nOperator: No, there are no more questions. Do you have any closing remarks, Mr. Kowlzan?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and everybody stay well, be safe and look forward to talking with you in July for our second quarter call. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.+",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. As Mark indicated, our corrugated products plants achieved a new all-time record for total box shipments, which were up 5.6% over last year as well as a new first quarter record in shipments per day, which were up 3.9% compared to last year's first quarter.Outside sales volume of containerboard was 13% above last year's first quarter, primarily attributable to increased domestic demand with export demand slightly higher as well.Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.54 per share below the first quarter of 2019 and down $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Export containerboard prices were down about $0.10 per share versus last year's first quarter and flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.I'll now turn it back to Mark. Yes. Okay. I'd just add, Mark, on the inventory side, one thing that's really helped us also is the availability of transportation, so that, as this economy really begins to open up and if that becomes under a little more duress, that may impact some of our decisions inventory wise. But as Mark said, it's amazing. We're able to run at this inventory rate.Let me just comment a little bit on your first question, George, relative to the customers and kind of what's going on. I'm just going to give you a quick synopsis, a little bit of what took place, as we saw it in the first quarter and what we see going into the second quarter. Obviously, the first quarter was incredibly busy, high demand, driven primarily by e-commerce and, of course, food and beverage on the retail side of the business.We alluded to the fact that we expect in the second quarter to return to more normalized growth rates, which is what we're seeing right now. So there has been a more normalization of the pattern, if you will, of demand.However, going into the quarter, as some of the food service sector begins to open up, we expect to see some return of demand in that particular arena. So I would just comment that going forward, as we alluded to in our comments, we're much more on track for that normalized growth pattern, which is in that 1.5% to 2% range. Mark, the mill outage impact, I mean, we managed around it, let's just put it that way. There were some trades that were in place that were impacted, that we had to take care of either through our mill system or through other trade partners. So we did incur some additional transportation expenses.But for the most part, again, it kind of goes back to the commentary around inventory, is that's remarkable how well we did given the circumstances and given the demand that we had in the first quarter and the very short lead times we had to meet. So overall, I mean, it's just - it was just a great team performance.The growth runway, we've - as you see in our capital investments and what we've talked about and whether it's building a new plant at a Richland or a Marshfield, we'll continue to be guided by our customer demand in those regions of the country, and we'll continue to provide those opportunities for growth as we see.I've said all along, I say, we're not a build it and hope they will come. We secure the business and then go out and invest the capital. So - and we'll continue to do that. So I see our growth runway as being very positive. And again, it will be dictated by our customers as much as anything else. Thank you. Yeah. Let's talk about the volume trends first, and then we'll get back to the mix side of it. But on the volume trends, as I said, the e-commerce and the food and beverage on the retail side in the first quarter, obviously, with some of the panic buying and some of the other things and, of course, consumers quickly changing from going to restaurants regularly to now being at home and to not being travelling or any of those other sorts of things, so that side of the business, I mean, really, really was very, very robust.The food service side of the business, on the other hand, which would be restaurants, hotels, airlines, conventions, all the other - stadiums, all those other areas of food service, that was down dramatically and has and stayed down throughout the quarter. I think they're seeing some signs of and hope of rebound, obviously, going into the second quarter as the economy begins to open up some.On the ag side of the business, of course, it's a mixed bag also. You had those ag industries that support the retail side, did very well, those ag industries that support food service. In some cases, we're applying produce under the fields.The auto sector has been \u2013 has obviously been under some duress. I'm talking about aftermarket, primarily. And then, of course, at the towards the end of the quarter, we had some we began to see some weakness on the protein side, meat and pork specifically. That's COVID related. Lot of things going on in the plants, 2-week shutdowns, things like that, that have gone on in some of those processing plants. So and we expect that to begin to come back.In terms of better mix and price, I mean, on the mix side, yes, the brown volume has been very good, again, driven by that e-com and that food and beverage side. But on the other hand, the display side of the business, the point of purchase display has been relatively weak, and we expect that to remain somewhat weak throughout the remainder of the year. Yeah. The demand is still as I alluded to earlier, I mean we're returning to more of a normalized growth trend. So demand right now is running 1.5% to 2% in that category, both on paper and on boxes. So that's about - I'm talking about linerboard medium here, not the paper side of the business.But - so that's about where we're running right now. I'd say it's a much more normalized growth pattern, as we talked about. But I do see some positives as we open up this economy. There's some opportunities, I think, to improve that as the quarter goes on. Yes, yes. Mark, this is Tom. I'll just answer that real quick. We haven't changed our stripes at all in terms of the type of business we go after or the mix of business that we currently have. It served us very, very well. And I think served us incredibly well during the first quarter.I'll give you an example of the way we operate. We \u2013 at various times, I mean, you're going to win some business, you're going to lose some business, you're going to do some other things. And we happen to, coming into this year, lost a very sizable national account.That's been replaced with about, I don't know, 50 to 100 accounts, so which is our niche and more about how we do it. And that's an example of the hard to do. And of course, that positions us for a lot less risk going forward when that business is spread over a much larger customer base. It also allowed us growth opportunities within all those accounts that we just picked up. And that's I think that's the best description of the way we continue to operate and what makes us somewhat unique, I think, in terms of the larger players. I would say, Mark, that it's more of a mixed bag. Obviously, if you're big on the e-comm side, you're going to have very big and large growth, all right, which we've participated in. Some of the smaller players there, they've done well. Some of them haven't done as well.Some of the business I'm talking about that perhaps was maybe negatively impacted in the first quarter through COVID and things like that, that chose to close will be reopening coming into the second quarter. So I think there's some opportunity there. But again, it's - I think on a macro basis, it's - there's a lot of give and take there. Well, we don't really break out our actual segments and how much of those sales are. But we do have a sizable amount that does go into food service. And that was very negatively impacted, obviously. And we expect it to come back, but it's going to come back slowly. I mean I just don't think there's going to be any return to what we used to consider normal in the short run. It's going to take a little while to get there. Gabe, let me see if I can take a crack at this. I'm not sure exactly what you're after. But on the food and beverage retail side, there's there are two distinctive markets really per se, okay? There's the - there's that retail side and then there's that food service side. And what we've - what I've learned even through this process from some of our end customers is how unique and different they are.It's almost like tissue. I mean tissue on the there's tissue on the retail side, and then there's tissue on the institutional side. And they're two completely different businesses and really different products. So you can't just swing from one to the other. And the same is very true even in the food business and especially related to the ag side of the food business, where you've got agricultural accounts that primarily serve the food and beverage retail side.And then you've got ag accounts that serve the food service side. And they don't swing from one to the other. They're just - they have completely different product lines and supply lines. So that's one of the big distinctions that we've seen here, is that we - obviously, in Q1, we had tremendous demand on that retail side just to keep store shelfs stocked.Now as we get into the second quarter, third quarter and go on and the economy begins to open up, we - the food service side will begin to pick back up. That will and the retail side will come down a little bit. But overall, the net effect of that will be an increase, probably a slight increase in demand, not a decrease in demand. Well, Number one is, I'm going to reiterate this over and over again, no matter what call we're on, and that is that our investments are customer-driven. So we tend not to talk too much about that when we when the demand gets to a certain point and we need more capacity, we take care of that capacity, whether it's at a box plant or at a mill.And we - there's no question, the patterns have changed dramatically as a result of COVID. I think the patterns will be it's going to be a long time before the patterns get back to what I'd call the normal that we used to understand, and we're going to have to adapt accordingly.One of the things that it does cause is it does - we could have - we can have tremendous demand in one region of the country or even a single plant and far less demand in some other plant. And therefore, we have to utilize our resources in a different way, which we do. And sometimes we incur additional cost as a result of doing that, but we take care of our customers.So we're just prepared to continue to do that. And we're prepared to look at the market through a very realistic lens and adapt to whatever change needs to take place. That's about the best I can summarize for you there, George. Well, it's George, it's hard for me to speculate on that, but I would say that most of the trends are positive for corrugated, okay? Now on the other side of the equation, it's been a negative for OCC collection, obviously. And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about OCC, but it certainly has impacted OCC collection.Getting it from the consumer is a lot more difficult, and getting it from the food service sector or the retail sector. And I think that's going to be a trend that we're going to be dealing with for quite some time."

            "content": "Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2020 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin our prepared remarks relative to the first quarter performance, I want to take a few make a few comments about the pandemic crisis in PCA. Without a doubt, these may be the most unpredictable and unprecedented times that hopefully we will ever encounter.There is no reference manual for managing through a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications, such as what has occurred with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our routines, habits, personal preferences, work and social activity and many other aspects of our lives are sure to change forever as a result of this.PCA's operations qualify as an essential or critical element under the various state and local shelter-in-place orders. Our leadership team is in constant communication discussing safety, the state of our operations, business continuity and other critical management topics.It is our responsibility at PCA to ensure that, first and foremost, we help provide for the well-being of our more than 15,000 employees and their families. We must do everything in our power to assist our customers and suppliers as well.We have implemented various procedures and safeguards at all our manufacturing, converting and office locations across the country to help keep our employees safe and healthy as we provide the goods and services considered essential for assisting with our country's response to the pandemic.We have also put measures in place to assist them with the economic ramifications that have resulted from these response measures. To date, we have not experienced any significant interruptions at our operations or in our supply chain due to the virus.Our network of mills, converting facilities and distribution operations strategically located throughout the United States gives PCA asset flexibility to manufacture and ship products to multiple locations.We will continue to closely monitor developments, take proactive measures to protect our employees, and provide our customers with the products and services they require.I could not be more proud of the effort, responsiveness and sacrifices displayed by all PCA employees, as well as our customers and suppliers. It has truly been an inspiring observation.I'll now begin with an overview of the first quarter results, and then I'm going to turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. I'll then wrap things up, and we'll be glad to take some questions.Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $142 million or $1.49 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.01 per share, related primarily to costs and expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.Excluding special items, first quarter 2020 net income was $143 million or $1.50 per share compared to the first quarter of 2019 net income of $187 million or $1.98 per share.First quarter net sales were $1.7 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $311 million in 2020 and $371 million in 2019. Details of the special items for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release.Excluding special items, the $0.48 per share decrease in first quarter 2020 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2019 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment of $0.64 and Paper segment of $0.05, lower volumes in our Paper segment of $0.03, higher annual outage expenses, $0.04, higher depreciation expense, $0.04, other expenses, $0.01, and higher tax rate, $0.01.The items were partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.14, lower operating costs of $0.09, lower converting costs, $0.04, lower freight and logistics costs, $0.01, and lower interest expense, $0.04, and non-operating pension expense, $0.02.The results were $0.30 above the first quarter guidance of $1.20 per share, primarily due to higher volumes in our Packaging segment of $0.03 and our Paper segment of $0.01, higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment of $0.02 and lower operating costs of $0.15, resulting from the excellent fiber and energy usage and lower input prices in our mills.Freight and logistics costs were lower than expected by $0.03, as were converting costs, annual outage costs and other expenses, each lower than expectations by $0.02 per share.Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2020 of $290 million with sales of $1.5 billion resulted in a margin of 20% versus last year's EBITDA of $334 million and sales of $1.5 billion or a 23% margin.Our containerboard mills established a new first quarter volume record, even while performing scheduled annual maintenance outage work at four of the mills. Our containerboard production allowed us to maintain our industry-leading integration rate of approximately 95% by supplying the necessary containerboard to our box plants, who achieved an all-time record for total box shipments, as well as a new first quarter shipments per day record.We were able to meet this greater-than-anticipated demand through proactive management, changing the sequencing of our scheduled maintenance outages, as well as outstanding execution of the work performed during these outages.Our enhanced capabilities to optimize the mix, freight and logistics costs, inventory levels and internal and external customer needs of the customer - of the containerboard system provided to us by our machine conversion at Wallula Mill were a key component as well.We ended the quarter with containerboard inventories at their lowest levels since the acquisition of Boise's packaging business in 2013.I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugating business. Thank you, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of $42 million with sales of $217 million or 19% margin compared to the first quarter of 2019 EBITDA of $55 million and sales of $240 million or 23% margin.First quarter paper prices and mix were below last year as expected, however, they were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our Paper volume was also lower as expected, primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill, however, it was about 3% higher than we had assumed.Although we ended the quarter with our inventory slightly lower than planned, on April 1, we announced downtime at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the months of May and June to ensure we manage the supply according to our demand outlook for the second quarter.Throughout the quarter, the mills did an outstanding job, managing fiber and chemical usage and maintained tight control over indirect and fixed expenses.I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. I want to reiterate the comments I made in yesterday's earnings release. As I mentioned earlier, these may be the most unpredictable and unprecedented times that hopefully we will ever encounter. Not a day passes that we realize something new being impacted in a way we had never thought of or imagined of before.Our consistent approach towards prudent capital allocation and sound financial governance has served us well for many, many years and is certainly helpful in times like this.PCA entered this uncertain period of time brought on by the COVID-19 crisis from a position of financial and balance sheet strength. Our focus has been and will remain on preserving that strength through the actions and decisions we make as a management team.As Bob mentioned, our company's liquidity position has never been higher nor has our confidence in the future success of PCA. We are well positioned to manage through whatever lies ahead, while ensuring we take care of the needs and expectations of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.However, the confidence does not translate to the same degree short-term predictability or guidance specifics that we normally provide at this time. Bob has provided you an update on estimates for certain forward-looking items.However, due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and the timing of the global recovery and economic normalization, we're not able to properly quantify our guidance for the second quarter.We've already announced the actions being taken in our Paper business, and we believe these actions will position us properly for what we anticipate right now for the second half of 2020. However, nothing is certain, especially now, and it may require further action to be taken. We know that we experienced a demand surge in our Packaging business in the first quarter, and the second quarter has also begun quite strong as well.Our containerboard inventory is at the lowest levels, both in total and in weeks of supply since our acquisition of the Packaging business from Boise. And while recycled fiber prices began moving significantly higher during the first quarter, our position as a primarily virgin fiber producer minimizes its impact compared to other producers.However, it only makes logical sense that demand in certain end markets will return to more normal growth trends at some point, although we've been successful at securing new business in end markets with a stronger demand outlook versus markets whose demand may be impacted more negatively.Also, it is impossible to predict what additional health-related measures will be or must be taken or dictated to us by the various state and local governments where we operate. Such events and actions could adversely impact the operation of not only our facilities, but also the availability of services and products we rely upon from our suppliers.That being said, it is also a fact that the products our company provides are essential to the response efforts, the recovery and the well-being of our country. The needs for our cost-effective, sustainable and renewable products will continue.While no one knows the severity or longevity of the virus' impact on global economy, it is my belief that this need will be even more in demand as the world recovers from this crisis.With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.And with that, Shelby, I'd like to go ahead and open up the call for questions, please. Good morning. Yeah. George, when we started the first quarter in January, we were looking at taking four of the mills down for their annual outages. And obviously, there is a lot of unknowns there. After the work was done, starting up the mills, all the mills started up remarkably well ahead of schedule and are running flawlessly since. So that was a big positive for us.And also, in doing so, the utilization of energy and other raw materials flows through. We've been - you would understand that with energy costs coming down, we were able to take advantage of lower energy pricing. And then again, just good efficient utilization of fiber and conversion in the mills.But again, just very well executed annual outages and utilization of the assets. And the same thing we're seeing in the box plant side of the business, in the converting side. Bob, you want to add something to that? I mean, to emphasize that, George, we're running Counce. Counce has essentially 1,000 ton a day recycling capability with OCC and DLK. And for all intents and purposes, we're not and we have not been using recycled fiber at Counce, it's all virgin pine. Tom, let me start off with the inventory question, and then I'll let you take the first part. As far as inventories go, obviously, I wish we had some extra cushion, but it is what it is. It's also a high-class problem when you have to run as efficient and hard as we are doing. I found over the decades that our mills run better when they are under duress, shall I say, and there's a challenge.But no, it's quite impressive that we are running extremely lean in the inventories. But as you could expect, our 95 box plants nationwide have supported one another. There were times during the last couple of months that we've shifted some inventory from one box plant to another to support the needs of their sister box plants.And again, having the full capability of the Wallula mill operating over the last year, that's given us tremendous flexibility and this whole logistics capability to support the nationwide footprint.So more than ever, having the mill system that we have allows us to run very efficiently even at the new low inventory levels. So - and Tom, why don't you go ahead and answer the first part of that question on where we are in the marketplace? Thank you. Next question please? Good morning. Yeah. Mark, as we talked about in the January call, at this essentially full integration we were at that 95% back two years ago to three years ago. We consider that full integration. We're still selling a little bit out in the open market, a very small amount, going offshore to export. So we do have the ability to pull some of that in over time if that dictates. We do have some room to continue to stretch Wallula as time goes on with some capital investment. And so that hasn't changed.But I think the bigger story will be, as it was back a few years ago, that we'll now have to look out and in a much, much broader sense of how we prepare the business for the next three to five years in terms of our containerboard supply.Shorter period of time, we can do what we did a few years ago and buy tons on the open market as we prepare for this future. But we do have some opportunities. We talked about that in the past. And so I'll just leave it at that. Nothing's changed. But we feel we're in a really, really good position right now. And we're very comfortable with that. Thanks, Mark. Next question please? Well, again, if you look at our plans for the first quarter, we knew we were going to be pushing the envelope on that lower end of the inventory because of the annual outages. We go through that every year to one degree or another. But obviously, with demand strong through the fourth quarter and then demand stronger than we anticipated in the first quarter, we really had to execute well through that period of shutdown time.Now the shutdowns are behind us. The mills are all running well. So we're able to continue to place tons into our system where we need to. Obviously, we don't have a lot of extra capacity. And I'll use the term, we don't have a lot of margin for error, the mills have to continue to run well now.We have our next planned outage in September at the Tomahawk mill, and then Filer City has no outage this year. We'll have the No. one machine down in Counce later in the fall, but that will be it.So we have the remainder of May through the summer months into the September period to run well and build up some extra tons where we need to place them within the system. Okay, thank you. Next question please? Tom, why don't you go ahead and handle it. I think everything we're seeing is what the - what has been reported in the public. The percentage of falloff of demand is pretty close to what the indexes have been indicating. If you would imagine that starting in March, all the school systems throughout North America started to shut down at from the university level down to the kindergarten level. Businesses were sending everybody home to work from home, shelter in place. So there was that big immediate fall off in demand for paper.What we saw a little bit happening through March into somewhat into the early part of April was that there were some channels and some outlets that were still stocking. People's buying habits changed, people that went home, businesses that were now operating in a different manner were sourcing their cut size, reprographic paper is an example, from different supplies. But we've definitely seen the falloff. Now, here is the end of April. And again, I would just refer you to what the publications are saying with demand.Now that being said, with talk about reopening various sectors of the economy in the United States, you could imagine if school systems come back up and run into the fall, schools will be reordering. Businesses that come back up will be continuing to reorder paper as time goes on.So we think where we are, we put ourselves in a good position to manage the inventory. We can manage that up and down. We have that flexibility. And so I'm very comfortable with how and what we're doing in the paper side of the business in managing to the demand. Correct. Okay, thank you. Next question? Good morning. I remember a year ago, in January, I was asked the question when I - I think we probably had $300 and some odd million of cash, and there were some individuals that thought that was a high number. And then we went into the second, third quarter of the year when cash is building up. And I remember the July call last year, when we were somewhere in that $500 million level, and someone asked me, didn't I think that was too high. And I said, no, I'd let them know when I thought it was too high. Here we are, approaching $1 billion, and I'll still use that and say, you never have enough cash, especially how I referred to it last year as we live in very uncertain times, well, this is about as uncertain as it gets.So I'm very comfortable with the cash we have. We also are generating healthy cash as we go through this. The capital plans that we have in place are very business growth driven and efficiency driven, and so we feel very comfortable with continuing on with the capital allocation in that manner.And also, as we go forward, with this fortress quality balance sheet, it does give us an incredible opportunity to look at acquisition opportunities that come along and they could be highly accretive in the future. So we can do just about anything that makes sense in the future and go forward in a very comfortable manner. Tom, you want to talk about containerboard, I'll talk about paper? And then with regard to paper, primarily cut size, again, I'm just going to refer you to what the publications are referring to and what they're anticipating for the second quarter right now. It seems to be holding up with their predictions of a downturn in demand. Next question please? Thank you. Next question please? Well, again, using that, you have to qualify the time that it takes to get there. And I would expect that for PCA, in particular, we're an American-based company. We do, again, a small amount of containerboard sales offshore, but we don't have operations. We produce and sell into the United States with our corrugated products and our paper, primarily here, again, in the United States, a little bit into Canada.But nevertheless, we do believe that we will come back strong as a country, and it's still the best place to be in the world. And so the caveat is it's just there's some time it's going to take to get there, but I still feel very good that we're in the right place in the world and in the right products. And we've got the platform to take advantage of that. Tom? Thank you. Next question please? Morning. Thank you. Adam, there's zero upside in us providing any guidance because of the uncertainty that we still live with day to day. Anybody that turns on the TV or watches the news or checks your Internet messaging, what's coming out of Washington, what's coming out of the state and local levels is anybody's guess from day-to-day and hour-to-hour, the Paper business, the demands.So it's not even worth trying to put a number on that until we finally get some time behind us in terms of normalizing the economy. And so that's about as simple as it gets. There's still tremendous uncertainty day-to-day. And Bob, do you want to... Well, we've said for seven years that the business has provided us a really good cash flow. We never had to invest an inordinate amount of capital. It's turned out to be a very good business in that regard. We've made no - it is what it is. It is a declining business over time.The decline had flattened out somewhat. We would expect that decline to continue over time in a normalized manner. And at such point in time that it called for, we do have numerous opportunities to take advantage of these remaining assets. That's all I'll say about that. Okay. Next question please? Tom, why don't you go ahead with that? Thank you. And Shelby, I do believe there are no more questions. Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and everybody stay well, be safe and look forward to talking with you in July for our second quarter call. Thank you. Have a good day."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. We had record first quarter cash generation with cash provided by operations of $237 million and record first quarter free cash flow of $166 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $71 million and common stock dividends of $75 million.We ended the quarter with $764 million of cash on hand or $913 million, including the cash we recently moved to marketable securities. Our liquidity at March 31 of over $1.2 billion is the highest ever for our company. And with the refinancing we completed in the fourth quarter of 2019, we have no debt maturities for the next 3.5 years.Regarding our announcement of taking our paper mill in Jackson, Alabama down for the months of May and June, our estimated second quarter financial impact of this decision is approximately $30 million or $0.24 per share.I want to update you on our full year guidance for certain items that we provided on last quarter's call. As Mark alluded to earlier, we managed through a very strong first quarter demand in our Packaging business, partly by altering the sequencing of the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills, as well as the containerboard machines impacted versus what we discussed during last quarter's call. There are no changes to the scheduled outages at our white paper mills.The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.22 per share, and the estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.09 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.34 per share in the fourth quarter. The full year estimate remains at $0.81 per share, as we mentioned previously.Also, our full year interest expense is now expected to be $88 million versus $81 million. And our net cash interest is now estimated to be $92 million versus $84 million, primarily due to lower expected interest income.Our cash tax rate estimate is now slightly lower than our earlier estimate of 19%, partially due to the downtime we announced at our Jackson mill, and our effective tax rate remains at approximately 25%.After a thorough review of our capital spending plans, we are not changing the range of spending we provided previously, which was between $400 million to $425 million, nor are we changing our full year outlook for pension contributions or depreciation.I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yeah. George, I'll just add. Part of what Mark was referring to and what we commented on earlier was on fiber end. Even though OCC prices were rising throughout the quarter, us being primarily virgin and with the woodyard project that we completed last summer at Counce, we saw significant usage and pricing benefit from that project, as well as other parts of the country. But Counce was a big part of that project we talked about around this -late summer last year. Hey, Mark. Yes. Mark, it's Bob. I'd say we saw what we were expecting, certainly some mix component to some of that, but it was about what we were expecting. Same to you. Yes, just with - and Adam, as well, with suppliers and services and whatnot, we have no control over what may be going on there. So we can't be as confident in that we feel good where we are now. But the supply chain, things can happen, and it puts a lot of uncertainty out there."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan and please proceed when you are ready.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you, Myra. Good morning and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs the packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up and then after that we'll be glad to take questions.  Yesterday we reported fourth quarter 2021 net income of $217 million or $2.28 per share. Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2021 net income was $262 million or $2.76 per share compared to fourth quarter 2020 net income of $127 million or $1.33 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter excluding special items was $463 million in 2021 and $293 million in 2020. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 net income included special items primarily for costs associated with the company's debt refinancing that was completed in October of 2021 and for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities.  We also reported full year 2021 earnings excluding special items of $894 million or $9.39 per share compared to 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share. Net sales were $7.7 billion in 2021 and $6.7 billion in 2020. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2021 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2020. Details of all special items for the years 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied their earnings press release. Excluding the special items the $1.43 per share increase in fourth quarter 2021 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $2.17 and volume of $0.35 in our packaging segment.  Higher prices and mix in our paper segment were $0.09, a lower tax rate for $0.04, lower non-operating pension expense $0.03, lower interest expense $0.02, and other items $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.68 per share primarily due to inflation related increases particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, wood and recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies, as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We had higher freight and logistics expenses of $0.24 per share as diesel prices and fuel surcharges continued to increase along with continuing truck and driver shortages and very low box car availability. Scheduled maintenance outage expenses were $0.14 per share above last year and volumes in our paper segment were lower by $0.11 per share as both our machines at the Jackson mill produced containerboard the entire quarter versus only a portion of last year's fourth quarter.  Finally, inflation on pallets and other materials grow converting costs higher by $0.08 per share and depreciation expense was higher by $0.04 per share. Looking at the packaging business EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter 2021 of $461 million with sales of $1.9 billion resulted in a margin of 24.5% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.5 billion or 19.7% margin. For the full year 2021 packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.7 billion with sales of 7.1 billion or a 23.9% margin compared to full year 2020 EBITDA of $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or a 20.8% margin.  Demand in our packaging segment remained very strong with record setting shipments from our corrugated products plants. In order to meet the needs of our plants the mills ran full out producing a record fourth quarter volume of containerboard. The high efficiency of our mill operations along with a very successful scheduled outage at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill and favorable seasonal weather patterns relative to temperatures and precipitation helped to minimize higher inflation driven operating costs during the quarter. Although we completed the scheduled outage our DeRidder mill earlier than we planned and we produced containerboard on both machines at the Jackson mill for the entire quarter, we ended the year with inventory including the additional containerboard from our December acquisition of Advanced Packaging, the low third quarter levels. And on weeks of supply basis we are once again below our targeted and historical levels.  Considering the anticipated strong demand and to mitigate potential project risks to supply chain bottlenecks for material and critical equipment deliveries, we have decided to postpone the first phase of the Jackson, Alabama number 3 machine conversion from the Spring and into the Fall of this year. In order to enhance the capabilities for reaching our target inventory levels and with four other mill already scheduled for the first half of 2022 outages, we felt this was a very prudent decision to ensure our customers are supplied with their needs and the quality of our conversion work at the mill meets PCA standards. We plan to continue producing containerboard on both Jackson machines for the foreseeable future and we'll continue to refine our estimates and assumptions to fully understand the potential of the entire mill to produce containerboard on both machines at their optimal cost and quality. I will now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business specifically. \nThomas A. Hassfurther: Thanks Mark. As Mark alluded to, in the fourth quarter our corrugated products plants established a new fourth quarter total shipments record and set a new all-time quarterly record for shipments per day both up 0.1% over the fourth quarter of 2020 which was an all-time record quarter for us and the industry. On a sequential basis we exceeded third quarter 2021 ship -- total shipments even though we had three less shipping days in the fourth quarter. For the full year annual corrugated shipment records were set as well both in total up 4.5% and shipments per day up 5% with one less shipping day compared to 2020. In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants our outside sales volume of containerboard was 36,000 tons higher than the third quarter of 2021 and 91,000 tons above last year's fourth quarter. In addition to the strong domestic market as we typically do during the second half of the year, we needed to catch up on commitments to our key export customers.  As you know we are not large players in the export market but we have developed long term relationships with certain customers over many years and you can't just turn these relationships on and off based on the relative dynamics in the domestic and global markets. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.87 per share higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 and up $0.37 per share versus the third quarter of 2021 as we have substantially completed our rollout of last year's price increase announcements. Export containerboard prices were $0.30 per share above the fourth quarter of 2020 and $0.09 per share higher than the third quarter of 2021.  Regarding our fourth quarter demand and our current outlook for 2022 as I have mentioned before, the same issues that continue to impact our ability to get more volume out of our box plants also persist with our customers and suppliers. Labor shortages which had already been an issue for some time have been even more challenging with the impact of the Omicron variant. Truck and driver availability, the lack of available box cars to move containerboard from our mills to our box plants, and many other supply chain bottlenecks will continue to be challenges for quite some time. Customers continue to tell us they have higher demand and could ship more if not for these or similar issues. There's no doubt we view demand as strong and we expect this to continue even with the numerous obstacles most companies are facing.  Finally, I would like to add that our acquisition of Advanced Packaging that we spoke about during our last call was successfully completed last month. This acquisition gives us the ability to integrate over 80,000 tons per year and provides several other benefits and synergy opportunities that we will deliver on very quickly. Although there was no meaningful contribution to our fourth quarter results as the transaction closed late in the quarter, we have already made tremendous progress integrating Advanced into our operations and we're off to a great start towards achieving our goals and objectives. This could not have been accomplished without the outstanding effort and dedication of the employees of PCA including our newest employees from Advanced Packaging. I will now turn it back to Mark. \nMark W. Kowlzan: Thanks Tom.  with sales of $143 million or 18.4% margin compared to fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA of $10 million in sales of $156 million or 6.1% margin. For the full year 2021 paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $72 million with sales of $600 million or a 12% margin compared to full year 2020 EBITDA of 73 million with sales of 675 million or a 10.8% margin.  As expected sales volume was below last year and third quarter 2021 levels as we did not produce anything for volume at the Jackson mill during the quarter. Average paper prices and mix were 9% above fourth quarter for 2020 and over 3% higher than the third quarter of 2021 as we continued the implementation of our previously announced price increases. While we have currently maintained our capability to produce uncoated freesheet on both machines at Jackson, we will continue to monitor market conditions and run our paper system accordingly. As we begin the call -- as we begin the year we anticipate that volume from our paper segment will be fairly representative of the over 500,000 tons per year capacity at the International Falls mill. The commercial team and the employees at International Falls have done a tremendous job optimizing our inventory, product mix, and cost structure and for 2022 we expect solid EBITDA margins of 15% to 20% from the paper segment.  Finally, I'll mention that last week we notified customers of an $80 per ton price increase effective with shipments beginning February 14th for all office papers, printing papers, and converting papers. I will now turn it over to Bob. \nRobert P. Mundy: Thanks Mark. The lower tax rate benefit in the fourth quarter was a result of favorable state income tax return versus provision adjustments made annually. We expect our tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 to represent a more typical rate of approximately 25%. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $391 million with free cash flow of $152 million. Capital expenditures were $239 million which was a bit higher than the guidance we gave you on our call last quarter as we were able to get more work completed on projects at several corrugated plants as well as items related to the Jackson number 3 machine conversion than we had anticipated. For the year our total capital spending of $605 million were still below our original guidance range due to the same material equipment and labor availability issues we spoke about last quarter.  Other cash payments during the fourth quarter included $189 million for the purchase price of the advanced packaging acquisition, dividend payments of $95 million, cash tax payments of $42 million, and net interest payments of $38 million. As we mentioned on our last call, during the third quarter we issued $700 million of 30-year 3.05% notes and use the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5% 700 million 2023 notes in early October. This transaction lowered our overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%, lowered our annual interest expense by $11 million per year, and extended our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. Our gross debt remains unchanged at $2.5 billion.  Based on the timing of closing the new bonds in September, our cash balance at the end of the third quarter included the new bond proceeds. However, since the redemption of the old bonds occurred in October, there was a cash outflow in the fourth quarter totaling $756 million which included a redemption premium for the retired bonds. The final significant cash payment in the fourth quarter was $193 million for repurchasing over 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $133.79 per share. This provided an earnings per share benefit of approximately $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to last year and we expect an additional sequential benefit of approximately $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2022. These repurchases of our outstanding stock, together with $380 million of annual dividend payments, represent over 52% of cash from operations or 64% of net income that was returned to shareholders in 2021. We ended the year with $765 million of cash including marketable securities and our liquidity at December 31st was just under $1.1 billion. For the full year 2021 cash from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $489 million. Our recurring effective tax rate for 2021 was 24% and our final reported cash tax rate was 19%.  Regarding full year estimates for 2022 of certain key items as we move forward, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $800 million and DD&A is expected to be approximately $455 million. With the recent fourth quarter 2021 share repurchases, we expect dividend payments of approximately $375 million and cash, pension, and postretirement benefit plan contributions of 52 million. Our full year interest expense in 2022 is expected to be approximately $86 million and net cash interest payments should be about $85 million. The estimate for our 2022 combined Federal and State cash tax rate is approximately 20% and our book effective tax rate approximately 25%.  Currently planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2022 will result in approximately 35,000 more tons of lost containerboard production compared to 2021, which includes the tons lost during the first phase of the Jackson number 3 machine conversion in the fourth quarter. The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs, and amortized repair costs is expected to be $1.13 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2021. Current estimated impact by quarter in 2022 is $0.15 per share in the first quarter, $0.33 in the second quarter, $0.24 in the third, and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark \nMark W. Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. For almost two years now, our employees have displayed tremendous adaptability and energy to overcome any obstacles in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company. We achieved new records for both containerboard shipments and corrugated product shipments. We have successfully completed or substantially completed significant cost reduction and process improvement projects at our mills, including a new boiler at our Filer mill for utilizing self-generated biogenic sources for energy, fiber flexibility projects at Wallula in Jackson, Alabama, Woodyard, head box and shoe press improvements at Wallula Mill, head box and wet end upgrades at the Valdosta mill, real upgrades, pulp mill refining and shoe press improvements at DeRidder, Louisiana and many others.  Along with our recent acquisition of Advanced Packaging, we completed numerous high-return projects in our corrugated products plants that will allow us to continue to better optimize the entire packaging business for the future and deliver profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities for our customers and shareholders. All the capital improvement projects that I referenced in the mills and corrugated plants, have required the complete involvement of PCA personnel from project conception, preliminary and detailed engineering, all the way through to project implementation and start-up. Although it required significant capital investments in order to achieve these important initiatives, we did so while improving our industry-leading return on invested capital to over 19%. We optimize the platform and financial results of our paper business while utilizing the versatility of the Jackson, Alabama mill to produce containerboard with minimal capital spending and delivering over $100 million of profit to our packaging business in 2021.  Over 64% of our net income was returned to our shareholders from dividend payments and stock repurchases. In addition, with our recent debt refinancing, we lowered the overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%, lowered our annual interest expense by $11 million per year, and extended the average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. And finally, we ended the year with almost $1.1 billion of liquidity and a strong balance sheet, which maintains the financial flexibility to react quickly to most situations or opportunities in the future. These accomplishments, along with the recently approved $1 billion share repurchase authorization, clearly illustrate our continued commitment to a balanced approach towards capital allocation in order to profitably grow our company and return -- and maximize the returns to our shareholders, while still adhering to our conservative balance sheet approach, as we've done for many years. I'm very proud of the accomplishments and the strong partnerships that we've built with our customers and suppliers over many years.  Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, in our packaging segment, we expect to benefit from higher corrugated product shipments with three additional shipping days, and we expect shipments per day to be higher than last year's first quarter, as demand remains very strong, along with slightly higher domestic and export prices and mix. Additionally, in our paper segment, we expect higher prices and mix from our previously announced price increase that was implemented beginning last November. There should also be a small benefit in the first quarter from our most recent uncoated freesheet price increase that was announced last week. Scheduled outage expenses will be lower and we expect a small benefit from our recent share repurchases. However, continued higher inflation across most all operating and converting costs, as well as freight and logistics expenses more than offset these benefits. We estimate this to be the largest inflation-driven sequential cost increase in our history. In addition to the inflation-related impact, labor and benefits costs will also be higher due to timing-related increases as we start a new year, and seasonally colder weather should increase energy and wood costs. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $2.50 per share. This does not include any potential benefit from a $70 per ton price increase across all liner and medium grades that we communicated to our customers within the last few days. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. And with that, Myra, I'd like to open the call to questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks. Hi, everyone and good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the year. I guess my first question to start, can you talk a bit in a little bit more detail on where your shipments and bookings are early in the quarter and did the tightness in the market and all of the supply constraints that we've seen and heard about in the sector overall, give you any opportunity to optimize your mix in corrugated, could you provide some color there? And then I have a couple of follow-ons.\nMark W. Kowlzan: We'll let Tom get into that.\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Hey George, this is Tom. Let me just give you a little bit of flavor for where we're starting out the year. If you -- and there's a little bit of confusion in the numbers perhaps. So the FPA considered January 3rd to be a full workday, whereas for the most part, PCA, that was a holiday. So if you left the FPA number in, we're up about 2% for the month. If you took that number out, you just went with the PCA days, we're up 9%. So maybe blended somewhere in there we're probably up about 5% to 5.5%. But as the quarter rolls on, that will kind of smooth out and even out. Regarding the supply constraints and optimizing mix, we're constantly looking at those sorts of things. And yes, there's no question that at times we'll have to rationalize some business, we'll have to do some other things. But for the most part, I'd just remind you, I mean, we've got 16,000-plus customers. We've partnered with these customers over a long, long period of time. We're very selective to the type of people we do business with, and we want to align ourselves with people who have long-term growth potential where we can enjoy both growth together. So that kind of -- hopefully, that answers your question this morning.\nGeorge Staphos: Yes, thanks for that. To some degree, even you said though in your release that price mix was a positive contributor to results, relative to your guidance in the quarter. So I don't know if there's anything else you'd want to call out there. My other two ones and I'll turn it over, was there -- or could you quantify to some degree, the benefit that the packaging segment got from Jackson producing purely containerboard and coming up the curve, recognizing not all the work is done there and similarly, in paper what benefit you got from not having some of those costs trapped since they're now allocated to packaging and was there any kind of benefit from no open market pulp purchasing for Jackson for the paper business? And then last, Mark, just on the share repurchase authorization. Obviously, you completed the last one. Obviously, the company generates a lot of cash flow. What, if anything, should we draw from the $1 billion authorization relative to your need for capital since you've done so many projects, and they seem to be generating a high return based on your results, relative to capital allocation for the future? Thank you guys, good luck in the quarter.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Thanks. Tom and I will handle both the first part of the question. But if you think about Jackson, for the full year we produced probably just almost 450,000 tons of board at the mill. We had a home for all of that through our system. If you look at it another way, if we hadn't had Jackson, we wouldn't have been able to grow with the customers in the manner that we had and generate the results. I called out on my portion of the script, Jackson contributed $100 million for the segment for the year. And again, Tom, if you think about Jackson, what it allowed us to do?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Yes, certainly Mark. And George, if you think about it, with the volume that we had and that we were able to grow with our existing customer base, had we not had Jackson, none of that would have materialized for the most part. And so the big jump in improvement really is a result of being able to get that board out of Jackson. And if you recall, I believe we forecast to be -- to take about 25% downtime in Jackson in the fourth quarter, which we didn't do at all, just due to the fact that we had significant demand and that demand is carrying right into the first quarter.\nMark W. Kowlzan: And then Bob, do you want to add to that?\nRobert P. Mundy: Yes, and George regarding the, I think, your question around the shift of costs from paper segment to packaging relative to Jackson in the quarter. Well, year-over-year, it was probably around $13 million that moved from paper to package of cost and then sequentially, it was probably $6 million, maybe about $7 million that moved from paper to packaging.\nMark W. Kowlzan: And then regarding the share buyback, as far as the remaining authorization that was utilized, it was -- the decision was made, it was the right time to use that authorization. It was the right time to buy and send that signal. And then as far as the new authorization for $1 billion, again, we just feel that's the appropriate number to have available as we go forward, and it continues to send the right message to the investors and shareholders, that we're going to continue delivering a return in many different ways, dividends, share repurchases, capital investments, and growing the company, i.e., growing the earnings that support all of that. So on to the next question, please.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nPhilip Ng: Hey guys, congrats on another strong quarter. It's great to see box shipments track really strong out of gate and you do have a little tougher comps. It would be helpful, Tom, maybe give us some perspective how you're thinking about the cadence and the growth profile for this year given some of the challenges you're seeing in supply chain, should we expect more of a normal PCA growth here again?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Yes. I would -- I'm very bullish. We're starting out very strong. We've got very good backlogs going into the year. It would be -- it would certainly be nice to get on a little more on to the downside of this Omicron strain, because if there's any one thing that's impacting right now, it's the fact that not only -- not only do we have labor shortages as a result of it, so do our customers. So it's a little bit choppy in our ability to be able to supply our customers on a consistent basis, because things are changing almost daily in every single box plant across the United States. But all of our customers, virtually across the board, tell us that they could have shipped significantly more if not for the labor shortages, truck issues and other supply chain issues that we mentioned.\nPhilip Ng: Got it. That's helpful. And then from a CAPEX standpoint, the $800 million CAPEX, it's a big number. Appreciating there's a lot of capital for Jackson, but any other bigger projects you want to call out that's going to be a nice needle mover, whether it's a box plan or any cost takeout projects you have in place for this year?\nMark W. Kowlzan: Let me just describe it in this manner. For 2021, we were working on 1,060 projects between the mills and box plants. And just in the box plants alone, on what we'd call significant sized projects, we had over 100 projects that we're taking care of and involving 53 of the plants, and we're continuing that effort and it involves everything from equipment replacement, equipment upgrades, corrugated rebuilds, new corrugators, just the continuing effort that we've been executing for the last four to five years now. We're doing it in a bigger way. The mills continue to enhance that opportunity to work on cost and efficiency. As we speak, we -- just two days ago, we just finished the rebuild of the Wallula number 2 paper machine. We rebuilt the wet end, new head box, new stock approach, all new electric drives, new DCS, a lot of supporting equipment on the machine. A lot of that work was done primarily by our own PCA personnel. And it was, again, just another example of what we do. Also as we speak, we're completing the first larger phase of the $50-some-odd million Woodyard project at Wallula, that's been started up over the last week. So these are the type of projects that will continue to enhance our ability. And so these projects will just continue. We have a whole portfolio that we work on every year, but these are the type of projects that we'll continue to see. Just again, numerous enhancements throughout the system. \nPhilip Ng: That's great color, Mark. And just one last one, appreciating you're seeing a lot of inflation across the board but you did mention that it's the biggest sequential improvement, I mean, hit, I guess, in terms of operating costs. Are there any big buckets you want to call out because I mean, at least on OCC nat gas prices, it seems to at least be stabilizing a little bit. So it'd be helpful kind of buckets in the biggest buckets where you're seeing a step-up sequentially?\nRobert P. Mundy: Yes Phil, this is Bob. You sort of look -- as we said, there's inflation like we've never seen in addition to what we -- the normal timing and seasonal type things. Moving sequentially all in, it's $0.55 to $0.60 per share. And I would say maybe $0.10, a little over $0.10 of that is just the seasonal timing type thing. So the balance of that is this inflation we're referring to. And yes, you're right, I think OCC seems to have stabilized a bit, but although extremely high compared to last year still. But the other buckets, whether it be the majority of the change in wood fiber, pretty much every chemical that we use, is going up. Energy will be higher. And then the big one is labor and benefits, over and above the timing type items that I mentioned. So it's really across the board, repairs and materials and other things. And of course, freight. Freight is another big item. So there's -- they're all fairly significant relative to what we've seen historically.\nPhilip Ng: Got it, thanks a lot guys. Really appreciate it.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nMark Wilde: Thanks. Good morning Mark, Tom, Bob. Mark, I wondered if you could just help us with a little more in the way of kind of cadence and details around sort of the steps as we go forward at Jackson in terms of generally what you're doing at each phase and what the step-up in capacity will be at each phase, and then what you expect kind of the ultimate capacity at Jackson might look like?\nMark W. Kowlzan: The phase that we talked about moving from the spring time that would be the first really big phase of machine work that will now be done in the Fall, that will enhance the capability of the machine itself to significantly produce at a higher speed. We'll be doing some work in the pulp in the back end of the mill to support some of that. We won't fully be able to take advantage of that work until the spring of 2023. So as we come out of this fall shutdown, we will have more capability to produce on a tons-per-day basis incremental capacity. We'll have the OCC plant completed this summer that will allow the utilization of some of that fiber over the machine after the work is done in the Fall. But the bigger benefit will come in the spring of 2023 when the final additional dryers are added to the machine, and there's some press work that will be done at that time, that will allow the full benefit of the work to be completed. And then you'll see the machine capability at the 700,000 ton production rate per year in terms of the final phase. So does that help?\nMark Wilde: Yes, that does help. But any sense of that second machine and what we -- you might ultimately be able to produce on that machine?\nMark W. Kowlzan: We've studied that, obviously, we're not going to talk a lot about that in public. That is a very good quality machine. It's obviously not as big -- the number 1 Jackson machine is not as big a machine as the number 3, but it is a very good quality machine. It has a very good trim. So as we are doing the analysis that we currently have underway, we look at market, we look at growth, we look at what our internal needs are, that machine offers a tremendous amount of opportunity. And then it depends on how much capital we would choose to apply to that opportunity. And I'll give you an example, the machine with minimal capital could produce 500 tons a day or at an appropriate capital spending, you could produce 1,000 tons a day. So it all depends on what we determine as the right situation in terms of demand and where we want to get tons from, but a lot of opportunity and a great asset base.\nMark Wilde: Yes, okay. The other question I had is really more for Tom Hassfurther. Tom, I wondered if you could just give us some sense of sort of inflationary pressures at the box plant level. And also related to that, just sort of what it means for the industry as we move to these bigger and wider corrugators and how that sort of ripples back into the mill system because it seems like most of the new corrugators that are going in are anywhere from 98 to 130 inches?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Yes, Mark. Well, I'll take the last one first regarding the corrugators. For a long time as an industry, we've been moving to wider corrugators. And the mills have just -- in my opinion, some of that is good for mills and some of that is not so good for mills. And as Mark just talked about, when you've got a wider machine, obviously, we've got more flexibility in terms of the trim pool for those wider machines for the wider corrugators. So, -- and quite frankly, what you need to do to efficiently get volume out of a box plant today, you're going to need a wider corrugator just to be able to run a profitable business, getting the proper amount of footage out the door. And a lot of these narrow corrugators are finding their way into combining into two narrows into one larger corrugator and those sorts of things. So there's a lot of moving parts going on, and that's been going on for quite some time. And it's -- if you take our mill system as an example, they just -- they know who their customers are, and they just adapt to what the customer needs are, and we figure out a way to do it and we figure out a way to do it very efficiently.  The inflationary pressures at the box plants, you've got labor, obviously, is a big, big issue for us. And the inefficiencies built in with all the absenteeism and everything else around the COVID that we've been dealing with for a number of years. Transportation is an enormous issue and all indicators are that, that's still rising dramatically and energy costs as well. So those are our key drivers.\nMark W. Kowlzan: I want to comment. If you went back to 2019 period, 2018, 2019, and you compare the hundreds and hundreds of projects that we've executed over the last couple of years, all of these from new equipment, equipment upgrades, new box plants, we've improved productivity per unit hour approximately 20% across the packaging system. And so our growth and the results would not be what they are if we had not been able to achieve the capital upgrade and improve all of the asset base in the corrugated packaging side of the business.\nMark Wilde: Yes, that's helpful, Mark. Tom, just to be clear on the freight. Would you in the box business, would you carry the cost of freight between the box plant and the customer or does the customer pick that up?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Well, that's -- listen, I mean, there's a lot of different things and a lot of different pricing mechanisms that we use. But ultimately, obviously, we're just not -- we're not prepared to eat these enormous freight increases and stuff, and that's what's driving some of the price improvements that we've just realized.\nMark Wilde: Yeah, okay, I will turn it over. Thanks guys. \nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, hats off for phenomenal quarter, great year. I was trying to get a better sense of you guys very thoughtful whenever you go to the market, raising prices to customers you just announced on containerboard. And you're performing superbly internally. People have been looking at industry data, and they've been questioning whether or not this is a good time to be raising prices. Again, you guys are very thoughtful. I'm sure you have a perspective and would love to -- if you're willing, to hear you share that?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: No. Mark, this is Tom. We don't -- as you know, we never talk about forward-looking pricing or what our thoughts are around it or anything else. So it's -- that's all I'm going to say about that.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Well, let me just follow-up on it a little bit as much as I would -- one of the questions, I guess, people are asking about is inventories seem to be going higher. You guys probably have a better view of what's really going on and the drivers and the dynamics of place, which I'm sure you're factoring in to the way you're thinking about how your business plays out and how the market is. Is there anything on that specific that you could share for instance, I did notice you talked about box cars being an issue. Would that potentially have led to, for you guys or the industry, for an increase in mill inventories where it's not necessarily occurring so much at the box plants, any color like that, that maybe you could share that would help us understand in these very unusual times some of the dynamics going on in the business that might not be so apparent to outsiders?\nMark W. Kowlzan: Mark, when the AF&PA data came out recently, there was a lot of confusion. You're looking at mill data. And if you think about the way the holidays fell and you think about how the mills were running, trying to get a truck or a box car at the mill, even if you could get a box car at the mill switched, the likelihood of getting it taken away from the mill was unlikely, hoping that trucks would show up. Again, it was a hope. So it was the most difficult period in the history of PCA trying to move containerboard during the holidays, and we saw the largest increase of our mill inventory since I've been here for almost 26 years in terms of the holiday build at the mill. On the other hand, we saw the opposite at the box plants. We saw the inventory drop to that low level as the mills built to the high level. And so not being able to speak for the industry, though. I believe we are probably all in a similar situation where we share a lot of the same railroads. We share a lot of the same trucking industry. And so it will be interesting when FPA comes out with their data. Tom, do you want to add a little color to that?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Yes, I totally agree with you, Mark, and it's -- I think a lot of people jump to conclusions quickly just based on mill inventory. And as Mark just alluded to, if you look at our box plants, our box plants are very skinny on inventory right now, and we need every ton that we can get out of those mills. Nothing's changed in the demand curve, as I talked about. So -- and of course, we trade paper as well. And we see the same problems coming out of other mills that we do out of our own. So I think taking a small snapshot of inventory at the mill level, which is -- which is a low number to begin with, and seeing those numbers go up, has led to a little bit of a misnomer, in my opinion, as to where inventories really sit right now in the industry.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Mark, if you go back before the pandemic and you think about a normal holiday, you could count on a rail switch one switch a day, even through the holidays. You'd have trucks still showing up as scheduled. Now we've just experienced a holiday where we didn't see trains for days to come and bring empty cars in and take your loaded cars away. And because of Omicron in particular, and what it was doing to the availability of drivers and rail crews, we had to deal with that. We were close to, in a few cases, running out of room to put containerboard on the floor at mills. And so it was an extremely challenging holiday period. So again, that's our take on that.\nMark Weintraub: I really appreciate all that additional color. Just are you seeing any easing on those issues yet or are they still as difficult as they were a few weeks back?\nMark W. Kowlzan: It's improved significantly, but it's improved to where we were before the holidays, which was not very good to begin with. I mean it's really the pandemic-related impacts of labor availability for everybody out there, whether it's the trucking industry, railroads. And so we have our inventories now headed back at the mill level into a more normal balance and getting containerboard out to the box plants and our outside customers. But again, every day is still a challenge. When you look at the winter weather and how that now impacts storm to storm. So again, it's improved, but we still have all eyes on, on what's happening 24 hours a day, trying to make sure we don't fall behind.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. Good luck on the quarter.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Alright. Thank you. Next question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. You may now ask your question.\nGabe Hajde: Good morning Mark, Tom, Bob. I was hoping maybe to get a little bit of insight in terms of kind of your mill system. We can obviously look at it and understand it's predominantly virgin-based. But as some of your customers, I guess, become increasingly focused on environmental initiatives, and want to incorporate more recycled content, could this cause you to rethink or at least consider having a little bit more recycled containerboard exposure in your mill system over time?\nMark W. Kowlzan: Tom, why don't you go ahead?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Hey Gabe, listen, our customer base and primarily, I mean I think the industry has done a very good job of educating our customer base, consumers etcetera with the fact that we have a sustainable product. And you can't have a recycled product without starting with a virgin product. So I think that most people now and certainly our customers, and we've done a good job educating our customers to the fact that virgin fiber, it performs very well. It gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of fiber we have in the sheet. We constantly are working on those sorts of things. And that creates the recycled stream down the road. So they get the closed loop system, they get the sole sustainability story around containerboard grades. And we'll continue to do what we see as the best things to do for our company and for our mills and for our cost structures going forward. And we really believe in fiber flexibility, and I think that's proven to be very good for us in the long term.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. Thank you. And then if you can give us a little bit of sense quantitatively kind of an integration rate exiting 2021 and then is there, I don't want to say a formal target, but bandwidth that you think is comfortable for PCA to operate within, and once you get to the low end or the high end or if you're making outside purchases, when you might want to think about more mill capacity?\nMark W. Kowlzan: I'll answer that, and I'm sure Bob or Tom are going to weigh in on this. As far as integration, we look at ourselves as fully integrated. We continue to move a minimal amount of product to some outside customers. That balance is going to stay normalized. Tom mentioned earlier on his part of the script that export sales in particular, we've had that customer base for many decades. But we rather than calling out an exact number, whether it's 92% or 94% or 95% or 98%, we are in a situation where we say we're fully integrated with the business as we run through and looked at last year, the year before and into 2022. Tom or Bob, do you want to add to that?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: I've got very little to add to that. I mean that is the way we look at our business. And even the small outside customer base, and I've mentioned before many times that, that outside independent customers have become smaller and smaller and smaller, as they begin -- as we've acquired them or other people in the industry have gone through the acquisition. And of course, the one we just did in Advanced, that was another very large one that is now -- will now be fully integrated. But even those outside customers that we have, we have such long-term relationships with them and long-term contracts with them that even to some extent, that few percentage of those customers we consider to be and treat them like they're fully integrated.\nMark W. Kowlzan: And I think also part of your question regarding going to the outside market for containerboard, we don't see that need. We're looking out into the future years on -- as the packaging side grows and we need to supply that demand. We have levers to pull internally on how we would do that, and we're very comfortable looking out over the next three to five years on how we would achieve the type of growth we would expect.\nGabe Hajde: Thank you guys. Congrats and good luck.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nAdam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning Mark, Bob, and Tom, congratulations on a really fine quarter. Mark, I think George asked you about this earlier, but just back to the buyback, you mentioned that you felt like now was a good time. And I'm just wondering why now as opposed to any time over the previous year or so, I mean the stock has been pretty range bound over the past several months obviously, you didn't buy back any stock in 2020 so I guess, why did you think now was the appropriate time as opposed to over the past preceding year or two and what signal were you trying to send to investors?\nMark W. Kowlzan: There's -- the only good way to answer that is that we just believed it was the right time that we wanted to go ahead and just reaffirm our ability to continue to take care of the investors and return value to the investors in numerous ways. We've been doing that with the dividends. We continue to generate extremely high returns with our capital spending that ultimately generates higher profitability, which continues to feed into the value for the shareholders. But we felt, again, with the cash that we had available and the fact that the stock was trading in the range it had been, we felt it was a fair price to buy at and it was the right time to buy it. Maybe it's as simple as that.\nAdam Josephson: Sure. No, I appreciate that. And just one on guidance, I mean you refrained from giving guidance at the outset of the pandemic for several quarters and then you reinstated it a few quarters ago. And obviously, you beat your guidance by $0.72 or 35% in the fourth quarter, which is outstanding, but it just makes me wonder how much visibility you still have in your business given these significant deviations versus your guidance. So how would you characterize your visibility into what's coming over the next several weeks or this quarter for that matter, compared to what it's been over the past several quarters and pre-pandemic for that matter?\nRobert P. Mundy: Hey Adam, this is Bob. I'll say that I know you were one of the ones that were wanting us to quantify again once we did stop just -- but there are more uncertainties now probably than when we stopped giving the guidance right there after the pandemic began back in 2020. Because so many things, whether it be people leaving the workforce, the COVID variants that have just made that situation worse, the supply chain has become even more complex and difficult, and many more obstacles. So things that have been embedded that started after the pandemic began have just becoming -- they just sort of continue to get worse. So there's more uncertainty now for us than there was when we stopped the guidance, frankly, and our results have shown, we've been conservative obviously, in our guidance, and -- which is one of the reasons I think we end up beating it. But as Tom alluded to, these same things that we struggle with, our customers struggle with. They see the orders, they put in orders for containers and boxes, but yet, then at the other end, they don't have the labor to get their orders out the door. So they have to change what they're doing. And that changes -- that all backs up to our forecasting and so forth. And it's not like we all of a sudden got dumb relative to how do we do this, we've always been fairly accurate, but they're just a lot more unknowns now, frankly, than there was when we started this back in late -- in the early part of 2020.\nAdam Josephson: No, understood. Thanks a lot Bob. Best of luck.\nMark W. Kowlzan: Okay, thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Roxland with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nMichael Roxland: Thanks very much. Hi Mark, Bob, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a solid quarter and year. Most of my questions have been asked, just one quick question I wanted to ask you about is inventory. And how -- can you help us frame how you're thinking about inventory management on a go-forward basis, given the supply chain logistics, which you constantly stressed on the call, how do you think about inventory level, excuse me, coming out of the other side, do you think that it'll be 5% higher or 10% higher, there's been -- the last couple of decades, has been a big focus on just in time, does that continue or do you try to modify that to account for any type of issues similar to the ones that you're experiencing now?\nMark W. Kowlzan: Let me answer it in this way, when we came out of 2020 into 2021, we desperately needed to build inventory, and we did that, and we got ourselves in a good place through the summer into the third quarter. But as we've also mentioned, the inventories now have dropped to a much lower point than we really need to be at. We're getting ready for -- we're actually into our annual shutdown schedules right now. So we will go through the winter and spring, and end up at a very low point. And so I'm not going to give you a number for a target, I'm just going to tell you that this year, as it has been for the last few years, will continue to be a challenge to make sure that the mills are producing and adequately supplying the box plants. And so in that regard, it's a high-class problem to have. But again, for PCA the situation is that where we had been was a good level to be at. But again, we slipped and lost ground with the logistics transportation issues. So -- Tom, do you want to add to that?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Well, I'd just say that one thing that's -- one thing to keep in mind is as we've continued to grow our business, the inventory has to be somewhat commensurate with that growth. And we just have not been able to totally catch up with that. We got -- as Mark said, we got into a decent position last spring and summer, but here we are starting out this year. We got a pretty gigantic backlog, demand has moved up again, and we've got mill outages coming. So it is all hands on deck to not only get everything produced what we can produce at the mill level, but to get it shipped to the box plants and to some of our other customers. Now the other good news is, at least, that our export business is heavy in the second half of the year and primarily into the fourth quarter. So that will get a little relief there, but we've got a lot of work to do to get the inventory levels back up.\nMichael Roxland: I appreciate the color. Just as things normalize, you get past COVID, how do you think about inventories then, will you keep let\u2019s say relative to what's been the historical trend, will you look to have a larger amount of inventory, just in case conditions like these new supply chains reoccur, are you going to be a little more cautious with inventory management, I guess, on a go-forward basis?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Yes, that really depends, Mike. What we'd really like to do is we could get back to some normality here. We like to operate with lean inventories if we can, providing we've got the whole transportation system and supply chain in place to be able to do that. Unfortunately, right now, we're still a long way away from that. But if and when that time returns, we'll operate incredibly efficiently, because that's a cost area that we'd like to avoid, if we could.\nMichael Roxland: Thanks very much. Good luck in the quarter. \nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nAnthony Pettinari: Hi good morning. Mark or Tom, you talked about postponing Jackson's conversion phase from Spring to the Fall to meet the very strong demand that you're seeing. I'm just -- is it possible to quantify how many tons that sort of buys you this year, if I'm thinking about that the right way?\nRobert P. Mundy: Anthony, this is Bob. I'll just say that relative to when it was originally scheduled in the spring and now frankly, the volume we were expecting out of Jackson this year is really about -- will be about the same. Because from when we originally started that machine up, we're actually getting more production out of it, or more efficiency out of it than we had originally thought. So although we won't be on that higher ramp as early in the year this year, because we pushed it from the spring to the fall, those -- that additional efficiency we've been getting out of the machine sort of on a net-net basis, we'll get about exactly what we thought we would get before we push that outage.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then on the containerboard price increase, not asking for any forward-looking view but historically, can you kind of remind us with previous price hikes, how many quarters or months those have sort of typically taken to be reflected or flow through to the bottom line?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: Yes. We typically, from the time of formal announcement to completion, we typically will roll that out over about a 90-day period.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. \nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle White. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to the labor challenges that you're experiencing and the industry is experiencing. Is there any way to give us the sort of order of magnitude in terms of how many workers at the box plants were typically out per week back in December and what that level kind of looks like today?\nThomas A. Hassfurther: I wish it was as predictable as that question might make it appear. We could have a high percentage of a workforce not out and in one place, and then have a pretty good percentage out at another place. So it's just moving across the country. And if you track what's happened with this Omicron variant, as an example, we track very closely with what's going on nationally. However, it's incredibly disruptive. At one point in time where you just have a -- you might have a whole crew on a particular machine center, a couple of machine centers not available on a particular shift, when in essence, we've got -- we certainly have the demand for that. So -- but I think in addition, I think what really complicates this labor issue is what I mentioned earlier, and then Bob just mentioned again, our customers are dealing with the same exact thing. And so there's a lot of disruption as a result of that trying to deal with this.\nUnidentified Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. It's definitely unprecedented time. It is difficult to quantify. On the buyback, given your healthy balance sheet, is there a time line that you expect to fully use that authorization that you just announced?\nMark W. Kowlzan: No. As we've done in the past years, we have it available, and we'll just leave it at that.\nUnidentified Analyst : Sounds good. I will turn it over and good luck in the year. \nMark W. Kowlzan: Thank you. With that Myra, I believe we're out of time and out of questions.\nOperator: Yes, Mr. Kowlzan, we have no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark W. Kowlzan: I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to talking to you in April to review the first quarter earnings results. Take care. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark W. Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Myra. Good morning and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs the packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up and then after that we'll be glad to take questions.  Yesterday we reported fourth quarter 2021 net income of $217 million or $2.28 per share. Excluding the special items, fourth quarter 2021 net income was $262 million or $2.76 per share compared to fourth quarter 2020 net income of $127 million or $1.33 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter excluding special items was $463 million in 2021 and $293 million in 2020. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 net income included special items primarily for costs associated with the company's debt refinancing that was completed in October of 2021 and for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities.  We also reported full year 2021 earnings excluding special items of $894 million or $9.39 per share compared to 2020 earnings excluding special items of $550 million or $5.78 per share. Net sales were $7.7 billion in 2021 and $6.7 billion in 2020. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2021 was $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion in 2020. Details of all special items for the years 2021 and 2020 were included in the schedules that accompanied their earnings press release. Excluding the special items the $1.43 per share increase in fourth quarter 2021 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $2.17 and volume of $0.35 in our packaging segment.  Higher prices and mix in our paper segment were $0.09, a lower tax rate for $0.04, lower non-operating pension expense $0.03, lower interest expense $0.02, and other items $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher operating costs of $0.68 per share primarily due to inflation related increases particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, wood and recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies, as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We had higher freight and logistics expenses of $0.24 per share as diesel prices and fuel surcharges continued to increase along with continuing truck and driver shortages and very low box car availability. Scheduled maintenance outage expenses were $0.14 per share above last year and volumes in our paper segment were lower by $0.11 per share as both our machines at the Jackson mill produced containerboard the entire quarter versus only a portion of last year's fourth quarter.  Finally, inflation on pallets and other materials grow converting costs higher by $0.08 per share and depreciation expense was higher by $0.04 per share. Looking at the packaging business EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter 2021 of $461 million with sales of $1.9 billion resulted in a margin of 24.5% versus last year's EBITDA of $303 million and sales of $1.5 billion or 19.7% margin. For the full year 2021 packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1.7 billion with sales of 7.1 billion or a 23.9% margin compared to full year 2020 EBITDA of $1.2 billion with sales of $5.9 billion or a 20.8% margin.  Demand in our packaging segment remained very strong with record setting shipments from our corrugated products plants. In order to meet the needs of our plants the mills ran full out producing a record fourth quarter volume of containerboard. The high efficiency of our mill operations along with a very successful scheduled outage at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill and favorable seasonal weather patterns relative to temperatures and precipitation helped to minimize higher inflation driven operating costs during the quarter. Although we completed the scheduled outage our DeRidder mill earlier than we planned and we produced containerboard on both machines at the Jackson mill for the entire quarter, we ended the year with inventory including the additional containerboard from our December acquisition of Advanced Packaging, the low third quarter levels. And on weeks of supply basis we are once again below our targeted and historical levels.  Considering the anticipated strong demand and to mitigate potential project risks to supply chain bottlenecks for material and critical equipment deliveries, we have decided to postpone the first phase of the Jackson, Alabama number 3 machine conversion from the Spring and into the Fall of this year. In order to enhance the capabilities for reaching our target inventory levels and with four other mill already scheduled for the first half of 2022 outages, we felt this was a very prudent decision to ensure our customers are supplied with their needs and the quality of our conversion work at the mill meets PCA standards. We plan to continue producing containerboard on both Jackson machines for the foreseeable future and we'll continue to refine our estimates and assumptions to fully understand the potential of the entire mill to produce containerboard on both machines at their optimal cost and quality. I will now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business specifically. Thanks Tom.  with sales of $143 million or 18.4% margin compared to fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA of $10 million in sales of $156 million or 6.1% margin. For the full year 2021 paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $72 million with sales of $600 million or a 12% margin compared to full year 2020 EBITDA of 73 million with sales of 675 million or a 10.8% margin.  As expected sales volume was below last year and third quarter 2021 levels as we did not produce anything for volume at the Jackson mill during the quarter. Average paper prices and mix were 9% above fourth quarter for 2020 and over 3% higher than the third quarter of 2021 as we continued the implementation of our previously announced price increases. While we have currently maintained our capability to produce uncoated freesheet on both machines at Jackson, we will continue to monitor market conditions and run our paper system accordingly. As we begin the call -- as we begin the year we anticipate that volume from our paper segment will be fairly representative of the over 500,000 tons per year capacity at the International Falls mill. The commercial team and the employees at International Falls have done a tremendous job optimizing our inventory, product mix, and cost structure and for 2022 we expect solid EBITDA margins of 15% to 20% from the paper segment.  Finally, I'll mention that last week we notified customers of an $80 per ton price increase effective with shipments beginning February 14th for all office papers, printing papers, and converting papers. I will now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. For almost two years now, our employees have displayed tremendous adaptability and energy to overcome any obstacles in both their personal and work lives to deliver significant accomplishments throughout the company. We achieved new records for both containerboard shipments and corrugated product shipments. We have successfully completed or substantially completed significant cost reduction and process improvement projects at our mills, including a new boiler at our Filer mill for utilizing self-generated biogenic sources for energy, fiber flexibility projects at Wallula in Jackson, Alabama, Woodyard, head box and shoe press improvements at Wallula Mill, head box and wet end upgrades at the Valdosta mill, real upgrades, pulp mill refining and shoe press improvements at DeRidder, Louisiana and many others.  Along with our recent acquisition of Advanced Packaging, we completed numerous high-return projects in our corrugated products plants that will allow us to continue to better optimize the entire packaging business for the future and deliver profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities for our customers and shareholders. All the capital improvement projects that I referenced in the mills and corrugated plants, have required the complete involvement of PCA personnel from project conception, preliminary and detailed engineering, all the way through to project implementation and start-up. Although it required significant capital investments in order to achieve these important initiatives, we did so while improving our industry-leading return on invested capital to over 19%. We optimize the platform and financial results of our paper business while utilizing the versatility of the Jackson, Alabama mill to produce containerboard with minimal capital spending and delivering over $100 million of profit to our packaging business in 2021.  Over 64% of our net income was returned to our shareholders from dividend payments and stock repurchases. In addition, with our recent debt refinancing, we lowered the overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%, lowered our annual interest expense by $11 million per year, and extended the average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. And finally, we ended the year with almost $1.1 billion of liquidity and a strong balance sheet, which maintains the financial flexibility to react quickly to most situations or opportunities in the future. These accomplishments, along with the recently approved $1 billion share repurchase authorization, clearly illustrate our continued commitment to a balanced approach towards capital allocation in order to profitably grow our company and return -- and maximize the returns to our shareholders, while still adhering to our conservative balance sheet approach, as we've done for many years. I'm very proud of the accomplishments and the strong partnerships that we've built with our customers and suppliers over many years.  Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, in our packaging segment, we expect to benefit from higher corrugated product shipments with three additional shipping days, and we expect shipments per day to be higher than last year's first quarter, as demand remains very strong, along with slightly higher domestic and export prices and mix. Additionally, in our paper segment, we expect higher prices and mix from our previously announced price increase that was implemented beginning last November. There should also be a small benefit in the first quarter from our most recent uncoated freesheet price increase that was announced last week. Scheduled outage expenses will be lower and we expect a small benefit from our recent share repurchases. However, continued higher inflation across most all operating and converting costs, as well as freight and logistics expenses more than offset these benefits. We estimate this to be the largest inflation-driven sequential cost increase in our history. In addition to the inflation-related impact, labor and benefits costs will also be higher due to timing-related increases as we start a new year, and seasonally colder weather should increase energy and wood costs. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $2.50 per share. This does not include any potential benefit from a $70 per ton price increase across all liner and medium grades that we communicated to our customers within the last few days. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that are filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. And with that, Myra, I'd like to open the call to questions, please. We'll let Tom get into that. Thanks. Tom and I will handle both the first part of the question. But if you think about Jackson, for the full year we produced probably just almost 450,000 tons of board at the mill. We had a home for all of that through our system. If you look at it another way, if we hadn't had Jackson, we wouldn't have been able to grow with the customers in the manner that we had and generate the results. I called out on my portion of the script, Jackson contributed $100 million for the segment for the year. And again, Tom, if you think about Jackson, what it allowed us to do? And then Bob, do you want to add to that? And then regarding the share buyback, as far as the remaining authorization that was utilized, it was -- the decision was made, it was the right time to use that authorization. It was the right time to buy and send that signal. And then as far as the new authorization for $1 billion, again, we just feel that's the appropriate number to have available as we go forward, and it continues to send the right message to the investors and shareholders, that we're going to continue delivering a return in many different ways, dividends, share repurchases, capital investments, and growing the company, i.e., growing the earnings that support all of that. So on to the next question, please. Let me just describe it in this manner. For 2021, we were working on 1,060 projects between the mills and box plants. And just in the box plants alone, on what we'd call significant sized projects, we had over 100 projects that we're taking care of and involving 53 of the plants, and we're continuing that effort and it involves everything from equipment replacement, equipment upgrades, corrugated rebuilds, new corrugators, just the continuing effort that we've been executing for the last four to five years now. We're doing it in a bigger way. The mills continue to enhance that opportunity to work on cost and efficiency. As we speak, we -- just two days ago, we just finished the rebuild of the Wallula number 2 paper machine. We rebuilt the wet end, new head box, new stock approach, all new electric drives, new DCS, a lot of supporting equipment on the machine. A lot of that work was done primarily by our own PCA personnel. And it was, again, just another example of what we do. Also as we speak, we're completing the first larger phase of the $50-some-odd million Woodyard project at Wallula, that's been started up over the last week. So these are the type of projects that will continue to enhance our ability. And so these projects will just continue. We have a whole portfolio that we work on every year, but these are the type of projects that we'll continue to see. Just again, numerous enhancements throughout the system. Thank you. Next question please. The phase that we talked about moving from the spring time that would be the first really big phase of machine work that will now be done in the Fall, that will enhance the capability of the machine itself to significantly produce at a higher speed. We'll be doing some work in the pulp in the back end of the mill to support some of that. We won't fully be able to take advantage of that work until the spring of 2023. So as we come out of this fall shutdown, we will have more capability to produce on a tons-per-day basis incremental capacity. We'll have the OCC plant completed this summer that will allow the utilization of some of that fiber over the machine after the work is done in the Fall. But the bigger benefit will come in the spring of 2023 when the final additional dryers are added to the machine, and there's some press work that will be done at that time, that will allow the full benefit of the work to be completed. And then you'll see the machine capability at the 700,000 ton production rate per year in terms of the final phase. So does that help? We've studied that, obviously, we're not going to talk a lot about that in public. That is a very good quality machine. It's obviously not as big -- the number 1 Jackson machine is not as big a machine as the number 3, but it is a very good quality machine. It has a very good trim. So as we are doing the analysis that we currently have underway, we look at market, we look at growth, we look at what our internal needs are, that machine offers a tremendous amount of opportunity. And then it depends on how much capital we would choose to apply to that opportunity. And I'll give you an example, the machine with minimal capital could produce 500 tons a day or at an appropriate capital spending, you could produce 1,000 tons a day. So it all depends on what we determine as the right situation in terms of demand and where we want to get tons from, but a lot of opportunity and a great asset base. I want to comment. If you went back to 2019 period, 2018, 2019, and you compare the hundreds and hundreds of projects that we've executed over the last couple of years, all of these from new equipment, equipment upgrades, new box plants, we've improved productivity per unit hour approximately 20% across the packaging system. And so our growth and the results would not be what they are if we had not been able to achieve the capital upgrade and improve all of the asset base in the corrugated packaging side of the business. Thank you. Next question please. Mark, when the AF&PA data came out recently, there was a lot of confusion. You're looking at mill data. And if you think about the way the holidays fell and you think about how the mills were running, trying to get a truck or a box car at the mill, even if you could get a box car at the mill switched, the likelihood of getting it taken away from the mill was unlikely, hoping that trucks would show up. Again, it was a hope. So it was the most difficult period in the history of PCA trying to move containerboard during the holidays, and we saw the largest increase of our mill inventory since I've been here for almost 26 years in terms of the holiday build at the mill. On the other hand, we saw the opposite at the box plants. We saw the inventory drop to that low level as the mills built to the high level. And so not being able to speak for the industry, though. I believe we are probably all in a similar situation where we share a lot of the same railroads. We share a lot of the same trucking industry. And so it will be interesting when FPA comes out with their data. Tom, do you want to add a little color to that? Mark, if you go back before the pandemic and you think about a normal holiday, you could count on a rail switch one switch a day, even through the holidays. You'd have trucks still showing up as scheduled. Now we've just experienced a holiday where we didn't see trains for days to come and bring empty cars in and take your loaded cars away. And because of Omicron in particular, and what it was doing to the availability of drivers and rail crews, we had to deal with that. We were close to, in a few cases, running out of room to put containerboard on the floor at mills. And so it was an extremely challenging holiday period. So again, that's our take on that. It's improved significantly, but it's improved to where we were before the holidays, which was not very good to begin with. I mean it's really the pandemic-related impacts of labor availability for everybody out there, whether it's the trucking industry, railroads. And so we have our inventories now headed back at the mill level into a more normal balance and getting containerboard out to the box plants and our outside customers. But again, every day is still a challenge. When you look at the winter weather and how that now impacts storm to storm. So again, it's improved, but we still have all eyes on, on what's happening 24 hours a day, trying to make sure we don't fall behind. Alright. Thank you. Next question. Tom, why don't you go ahead? I'll answer that, and I'm sure Bob or Tom are going to weigh in on this. As far as integration, we look at ourselves as fully integrated. We continue to move a minimal amount of product to some outside customers. That balance is going to stay normalized. Tom mentioned earlier on his part of the script that export sales in particular, we've had that customer base for many decades. But we rather than calling out an exact number, whether it's 92% or 94% or 95% or 98%, we are in a situation where we say we're fully integrated with the business as we run through and looked at last year, the year before and into 2022. Tom or Bob, do you want to add to that? And I think also part of your question regarding going to the outside market for containerboard, we don't see that need. We're looking out into the future years on -- as the packaging side grows and we need to supply that demand. We have levers to pull internally on how we would do that, and we're very comfortable looking out over the next three to five years on how we would achieve the type of growth we would expect. Thank you. Next question. There's -- the only good way to answer that is that we just believed it was the right time that we wanted to go ahead and just reaffirm our ability to continue to take care of the investors and return value to the investors in numerous ways. We've been doing that with the dividends. We continue to generate extremely high returns with our capital spending that ultimately generates higher profitability, which continues to feed into the value for the shareholders. But we felt, again, with the cash that we had available and the fact that the stock was trading in the range it had been, we felt it was a fair price to buy at and it was the right time to buy it. Maybe it's as simple as that. Okay, thank you. Next question please. Let me answer it in this way, when we came out of 2020 into 2021, we desperately needed to build inventory, and we did that, and we got ourselves in a good place through the summer into the third quarter. But as we've also mentioned, the inventories now have dropped to a much lower point than we really need to be at. We're getting ready for -- we're actually into our annual shutdown schedules right now. So we will go through the winter and spring, and end up at a very low point. And so I'm not going to give you a number for a target, I'm just going to tell you that this year, as it has been for the last few years, will continue to be a challenge to make sure that the mills are producing and adequately supplying the box plants. And so in that regard, it's a high-class problem to have. But again, for PCA the situation is that where we had been was a good level to be at. But again, we slipped and lost ground with the logistics transportation issues. So -- Tom, do you want to add to that? Thank you. Next question please. Thank you. Next question please. No. As we've done in the past years, we have it available, and we'll just leave it at that. Thank you. With that Myra, I believe we're out of time and out of questions. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to talking to you in April to review the first quarter earnings results. Take care. Have a good day."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. As Mark alluded to, in the fourth quarter our corrugated products plants established a new fourth quarter total shipments record and set a new all-time quarterly record for shipments per day both up 0.1% over the fourth quarter of 2020 which was an all-time record quarter for us and the industry. On a sequential basis we exceeded third quarter 2021 ship -- total shipments even though we had three less shipping days in the fourth quarter. For the full year annual corrugated shipment records were set as well both in total up 4.5% and shipments per day up 5% with one less shipping day compared to 2020. In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants our outside sales volume of containerboard was 36,000 tons higher than the third quarter of 2021 and 91,000 tons above last year's fourth quarter. In addition to the strong domestic market as we typically do during the second half of the year, we needed to catch up on commitments to our key export customers.  As you know we are not large players in the export market but we have developed long term relationships with certain customers over many years and you can't just turn these relationships on and off based on the relative dynamics in the domestic and global markets. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.87 per share higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 and up $0.37 per share versus the third quarter of 2021 as we have substantially completed our rollout of last year's price increase announcements. Export containerboard prices were $0.30 per share above the fourth quarter of 2020 and $0.09 per share higher than the third quarter of 2021.  Regarding our fourth quarter demand and our current outlook for 2022 as I have mentioned before, the same issues that continue to impact our ability to get more volume out of our box plants also persist with our customers and suppliers. Labor shortages which had already been an issue for some time have been even more challenging with the impact of the Omicron variant. Truck and driver availability, the lack of available box cars to move containerboard from our mills to our box plants, and many other supply chain bottlenecks will continue to be challenges for quite some time. Customers continue to tell us they have higher demand and could ship more if not for these or similar issues. There's no doubt we view demand as strong and we expect this to continue even with the numerous obstacles most companies are facing.  Finally, I would like to add that our acquisition of Advanced Packaging that we spoke about during our last call was successfully completed last month. This acquisition gives us the ability to integrate over 80,000 tons per year and provides several other benefits and synergy opportunities that we will deliver on very quickly. Although there was no meaningful contribution to our fourth quarter results as the transaction closed late in the quarter, we have already made tremendous progress integrating Advanced into our operations and we're off to a great start towards achieving our goals and objectives. This could not have been accomplished without the outstanding effort and dedication of the employees of PCA including our newest employees from Advanced Packaging. I will now turn it back to Mark. Hey George, this is Tom. Let me just give you a little bit of flavor for where we're starting out the year. If you -- and there's a little bit of confusion in the numbers perhaps. So the FPA considered January 3rd to be a full workday, whereas for the most part, PCA, that was a holiday. So if you left the FPA number in, we're up about 2% for the month. If you took that number out, you just went with the PCA days, we're up 9%. So maybe blended somewhere in there we're probably up about 5% to 5.5%. But as the quarter rolls on, that will kind of smooth out and even out. Regarding the supply constraints and optimizing mix, we're constantly looking at those sorts of things. And yes, there's no question that at times we'll have to rationalize some business, we'll have to do some other things. But for the most part, I'd just remind you, I mean, we've got 16,000-plus customers. We've partnered with these customers over a long, long period of time. We're very selective to the type of people we do business with, and we want to align ourselves with people who have long-term growth potential where we can enjoy both growth together. So that kind of -- hopefully, that answers your question this morning. Yes, certainly Mark. And George, if you think about it, with the volume that we had and that we were able to grow with our existing customer base, had we not had Jackson, none of that would have materialized for the most part. And so the big jump in improvement really is a result of being able to get that board out of Jackson. And if you recall, I believe we forecast to be -- to take about 25% downtime in Jackson in the fourth quarter, which we didn't do at all, just due to the fact that we had significant demand and that demand is carrying right into the first quarter. Yes. I would -- I'm very bullish. We're starting out very strong. We've got very good backlogs going into the year. It would be -- it would certainly be nice to get on a little more on to the downside of this Omicron strain, because if there's any one thing that's impacting right now, it's the fact that not only -- not only do we have labor shortages as a result of it, so do our customers. So it's a little bit choppy in our ability to be able to supply our customers on a consistent basis, because things are changing almost daily in every single box plant across the United States. But all of our customers, virtually across the board, tell us that they could have shipped significantly more if not for the labor shortages, truck issues and other supply chain issues that we mentioned. Yes, Mark. Well, I'll take the last one first regarding the corrugators. For a long time as an industry, we've been moving to wider corrugators. And the mills have just -- in my opinion, some of that is good for mills and some of that is not so good for mills. And as Mark just talked about, when you've got a wider machine, obviously, we've got more flexibility in terms of the trim pool for those wider machines for the wider corrugators. So, -- and quite frankly, what you need to do to efficiently get volume out of a box plant today, you're going to need a wider corrugator just to be able to run a profitable business, getting the proper amount of footage out the door. And a lot of these narrow corrugators are finding their way into combining into two narrows into one larger corrugator and those sorts of things. So there's a lot of moving parts going on, and that's been going on for quite some time. And it's -- if you take our mill system as an example, they just -- they know who their customers are, and they just adapt to what the customer needs are, and we figure out a way to do it and we figure out a way to do it very efficiently.  The inflationary pressures at the box plants, you've got labor, obviously, is a big, big issue for us. And the inefficiencies built in with all the absenteeism and everything else around the COVID that we've been dealing with for a number of years. Transportation is an enormous issue and all indicators are that, that's still rising dramatically and energy costs as well. So those are our key drivers. Well, that's -- listen, I mean, there's a lot of different things and a lot of different pricing mechanisms that we use. But ultimately, obviously, we're just not -- we're not prepared to eat these enormous freight increases and stuff, and that's what's driving some of the price improvements that we've just realized. No. Mark, this is Tom. We don't -- as you know, we never talk about forward-looking pricing or what our thoughts are around it or anything else. So it's -- that's all I'm going to say about that. Yes, I totally agree with you, Mark, and it's -- I think a lot of people jump to conclusions quickly just based on mill inventory. And as Mark just alluded to, if you look at our box plants, our box plants are very skinny on inventory right now, and we need every ton that we can get out of those mills. Nothing's changed in the demand curve, as I talked about. So -- and of course, we trade paper as well. And we see the same problems coming out of other mills that we do out of our own. So I think taking a small snapshot of inventory at the mill level, which is -- which is a low number to begin with, and seeing those numbers go up, has led to a little bit of a misnomer, in my opinion, as to where inventories really sit right now in the industry. Hey Gabe, listen, our customer base and primarily, I mean I think the industry has done a very good job of educating our customer base, consumers etcetera with the fact that we have a sustainable product. And you can't have a recycled product without starting with a virgin product. So I think that most people now and certainly our customers, and we've done a good job educating our customers to the fact that virgin fiber, it performs very well. It gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of fiber we have in the sheet. We constantly are working on those sorts of things. And that creates the recycled stream down the road. So they get the closed loop system, they get the sole sustainability story around containerboard grades. And we'll continue to do what we see as the best things to do for our company and for our mills and for our cost structures going forward. And we really believe in fiber flexibility, and I think that's proven to be very good for us in the long term. I've got very little to add to that. I mean that is the way we look at our business. And even the small outside customer base, and I've mentioned before many times that, that outside independent customers have become smaller and smaller and smaller, as they begin -- as we've acquired them or other people in the industry have gone through the acquisition. And of course, the one we just did in Advanced, that was another very large one that is now -- will now be fully integrated. But even those outside customers that we have, we have such long-term relationships with them and long-term contracts with them that even to some extent, that few percentage of those customers we consider to be and treat them like they're fully integrated. Well, I'd just say that one thing that's -- one thing to keep in mind is as we've continued to grow our business, the inventory has to be somewhat commensurate with that growth. And we just have not been able to totally catch up with that. We got -- as Mark said, we got into a decent position last spring and summer, but here we are starting out this year. We got a pretty gigantic backlog, demand has moved up again, and we've got mill outages coming. So it is all hands on deck to not only get everything produced what we can produce at the mill level, but to get it shipped to the box plants and to some of our other customers. Now the other good news is, at least, that our export business is heavy in the second half of the year and primarily into the fourth quarter. So that will get a little relief there, but we've got a lot of work to do to get the inventory levels back up. Yes, that really depends, Mike. What we'd really like to do is we could get back to some normality here. We like to operate with lean inventories if we can, providing we've got the whole transportation system and supply chain in place to be able to do that. Unfortunately, right now, we're still a long way away from that. But if and when that time returns, we'll operate incredibly efficiently, because that's a cost area that we'd like to avoid, if we could. Yes. We typically, from the time of formal announcement to completion, we typically will roll that out over about a 90-day period. I wish it was as predictable as that question might make it appear. We could have a high percentage of a workforce not out and in one place, and then have a pretty good percentage out at another place. So it's just moving across the country. And if you track what's happened with this Omicron variant, as an example, we track very closely with what's going on nationally. However, it's incredibly disruptive. At one point in time where you just have a -- you might have a whole crew on a particular machine center, a couple of machine centers not available on a particular shift, when in essence, we've got -- we certainly have the demand for that. So -- but I think in addition, I think what really complicates this labor issue is what I mentioned earlier, and then Bob just mentioned again, our customers are dealing with the same exact thing. And so there's a lot of disruption as a result of that trying to deal with this."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. The lower tax rate benefit in the fourth quarter was a result of favorable state income tax return versus provision adjustments made annually. We expect our tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 to represent a more typical rate of approximately 25%. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $391 million with free cash flow of $152 million. Capital expenditures were $239 million which was a bit higher than the guidance we gave you on our call last quarter as we were able to get more work completed on projects at several corrugated plants as well as items related to the Jackson number 3 machine conversion than we had anticipated. For the year our total capital spending of $605 million were still below our original guidance range due to the same material equipment and labor availability issues we spoke about last quarter.  Other cash payments during the fourth quarter included $189 million for the purchase price of the advanced packaging acquisition, dividend payments of $95 million, cash tax payments of $42 million, and net interest payments of $38 million. As we mentioned on our last call, during the third quarter we issued $700 million of 30-year 3.05% notes and use the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5% 700 million 2023 notes in early October. This transaction lowered our overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%, lowered our annual interest expense by $11 million per year, and extended our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. Our gross debt remains unchanged at $2.5 billion.  Based on the timing of closing the new bonds in September, our cash balance at the end of the third quarter included the new bond proceeds. However, since the redemption of the old bonds occurred in October, there was a cash outflow in the fourth quarter totaling $756 million which included a redemption premium for the retired bonds. The final significant cash payment in the fourth quarter was $193 million for repurchasing over 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $133.79 per share. This provided an earnings per share benefit of approximately $0.01 in the fourth quarter compared to last year and we expect an additional sequential benefit of approximately $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2022. These repurchases of our outstanding stock, together with $380 million of annual dividend payments, represent over 52% of cash from operations or 64% of net income that was returned to shareholders in 2021. We ended the year with $765 million of cash including marketable securities and our liquidity at December 31st was just under $1.1 billion. For the full year 2021 cash from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $489 million. Our recurring effective tax rate for 2021 was 24% and our final reported cash tax rate was 19%.  Regarding full year estimates for 2022 of certain key items as we move forward, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $800 million and DD&A is expected to be approximately $455 million. With the recent fourth quarter 2021 share repurchases, we expect dividend payments of approximately $375 million and cash, pension, and postretirement benefit plan contributions of 52 million. Our full year interest expense in 2022 is expected to be approximately $86 million and net cash interest payments should be about $85 million. The estimate for our 2022 combined Federal and State cash tax rate is approximately 20% and our book effective tax rate approximately 25%.  Currently planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2022 will result in approximately 35,000 more tons of lost containerboard production compared to 2021, which includes the tons lost during the first phase of the Jackson number 3 machine conversion in the fourth quarter. The annual earnings impact of these outages, including lost volume, direct costs, and amortized repair costs is expected to be $1.13 per share compared to $0.91 per share in 2021. Current estimated impact by quarter in 2022 is $0.15 per share in the first quarter, $0.33 in the second quarter, $0.24 in the third, and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark Yes, and George regarding the, I think, your question around the shift of costs from paper segment to packaging relative to Jackson in the quarter. Well, year-over-year, it was probably around $13 million that moved from paper to package of cost and then sequentially, it was probably $6 million, maybe about $7 million that moved from paper to packaging. Yes Phil, this is Bob. You sort of look -- as we said, there's inflation like we've never seen in addition to what we -- the normal timing and seasonal type things. Moving sequentially all in, it's $0.55 to $0.60 per share. And I would say maybe $0.10, a little over $0.10 of that is just the seasonal timing type thing. So the balance of that is this inflation we're referring to. And yes, you're right, I think OCC seems to have stabilized a bit, but although extremely high compared to last year still. But the other buckets, whether it be the majority of the change in wood fiber, pretty much every chemical that we use, is going up. Energy will be higher. And then the big one is labor and benefits, over and above the timing type items that I mentioned. So it's really across the board, repairs and materials and other things. And of course, freight. Freight is another big item. So there's -- they're all fairly significant relative to what we've seen historically. Hey Adam, this is Bob. I'll say that I know you were one of the ones that were wanting us to quantify again once we did stop just -- but there are more uncertainties now probably than when we stopped giving the guidance right there after the pandemic began back in 2020. Because so many things, whether it be people leaving the workforce, the COVID variants that have just made that situation worse, the supply chain has become even more complex and difficult, and many more obstacles. So things that have been embedded that started after the pandemic began have just becoming -- they just sort of continue to get worse. So there's more uncertainty now for us than there was when we stopped the guidance, frankly, and our results have shown, we've been conservative obviously, in our guidance, and -- which is one of the reasons I think we end up beating it. But as Tom alluded to, these same things that we struggle with, our customers struggle with. They see the orders, they put in orders for containers and boxes, but yet, then at the other end, they don't have the labor to get their orders out the door. So they have to change what they're doing. And that changes -- that all backs up to our forecasting and so forth. And it's not like we all of a sudden got dumb relative to how do we do this, we've always been fairly accurate, but they're just a lot more unknowns now, frankly, than there was when we started this back in late -- in the early part of 2020. Anthony, this is Bob. I'll just say that relative to when it was originally scheduled in the spring and now frankly, the volume we were expecting out of Jackson this year is really about -- will be about the same. Because from when we originally started that machine up, we're actually getting more production out of it, or more efficiency out of it than we had originally thought. So although we won't be on that higher ramp as early in the year this year, because we pushed it from the spring to the fall, those -- that additional efficiency we've been getting out of the machine sort of on a net-net basis, we'll get about exactly what we thought we would get before we push that outage."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA.  I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan and please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and again, thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I will be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. After that, I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $251 million or $2.63 per share. Excluding the special items, third quarter 2021 net income was $257 million or $2.69 per share compared to third quarter 2020 net income of $149 million or $1.57 per share. Third quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding the special items, was $464 million in 2021 and $323 million in 2020. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.06 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities. While last year's third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share that were related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on the DeRidder, Louisiana mill. Details of all the special items for the third quarter of 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $1.12 per share increase in third quarter 2021 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.58 and volume $0.62 in our Packaging segment; higher production volume of $0.06 and prices and mix of $0.05 in our Paper segment; and lower nonoperating pension expense, $0.03; and lower interest expense, $0.01. Items were partially offset by operating costs, which were $0.84 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.10 per share higher. For the last several quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen and were $0.23 per share higher compared to last year, driven by significant increases in fuel costs, tight truck supply, driver shortages and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand. And finally, scheduled outage expenses were $0.04 per share higher than last year, and sales volume in our Paper segment was lower by $0.02 per share. Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2021 of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 26% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion and a 22% margin. Packaging segment demand remained strong, and the teams did a tremendous job of implementing our previously announced containerboard and corrugated products price increases. The containerboard mills set an all-time quarterly sales volume record and our box plants set new third quarter records for total corrugated product shipments as well as shipments per day. By utilizing the capability of both machines at our Jackson, Alabama mill to produce containerboard, we were able to reach our desired inventory levels to better serve our customer demand, help minimize the transportation challenges we continue to experience and build some inventory ahead of the DeRidder mills' fourth quarter outage. We manage very effectively the execution of numerous initiatives and capital projects to reduce costs through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements across our manufacturing locations. We continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material, equipment and labor availability issues to keep our customers supplied in their needs and their capital projects on track. With no relief from the supply chain obstacles that we, our customers and our suppliers continue to face, along with unprecedented inflation-related challenges, the combination of all of these efforts are critical to our success going forward. The improvements in execution our employees deliver constantly across many fronts is what allows us to continuously improve margins. After successfully completing the planned maintenance outage at the Jackson mill during the third quarter, the mill restarted with the number-1 machine making corrugated medium rather than uncoated freesheet grades, utilizing a mix of virgin craft and DLK fiber based on the needs of our customers. This was required to help meet continued strong demand from our box plant customers, meet our targeted inventory levels prior to year-end and help supply the needs of our box plant acquisition that we anticipate acquiring later this quarter. Similar to the number-3 machine at Jackson, the smaller number-1 machine is highly efficient. It's a versatile machine and with minimal capital required to repurpose a deinking plant to handle DLK. The machine was very quickly able to produce high-quality medium for the box plants. Although still capable of producing uncoated freesheet products, we plan to continue producing medium on the machine over the next several months as our internal and external packaging demand warrants. This gives us the opportunity to further evaluate the machine's capabilities and to process -- and the process changes that might be required to potentially produce medium permanently in a cost-effective manner. We'll also use the period to further refine our estimates and assumptions to fully understand the potential of the entire mill to produce containerboard on both machines at their optimal cost and quality. This will also allow us to evaluate our strategic containerboard supply capabilities for providing the necessary runway to grow our integrated downstream box demand. We are committed to being fully integrated, and we have a track record of ramping up our internal capacity according to our customers' demand requirements. The previously announced conversion of the J3 machine to linerboard remains on track with no changes to the schedule we discussed on last quarter's call. We'll continue to serve our paper customers with both machines at our International Falls mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades as well as available inventory produced on the number-1 machine at Jackson. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales, our corrugated business and the box plant acquisition that I mentioned.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. We continue to get excellent realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.40 per share above the third quarter of 2020 and up $0.55 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.18 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, and up $0.06 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. As Mark mentioned, we achieved a new all-time record for containerboard shipments with continued strong demand in our box plants as well as our domestic and export containerboard markets. We had record third quarter corrugated product shipments, which were up 2.3% in total and per workday over last year's very strong third quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of 2021, our box shipment volume was up 6.7% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 4.5%. In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants, our outside sales volume of containerboard was 73,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 37,000 tons higher than the second quarter of 2021. Regarding our third quarter demand and our outlook, I'd like to reemphasize some points I made on previous earning calls and what Mark alluded to earlier the same issues that impact our ability to get more volume out of our box plants like labor shortages, truck availability, driver shortages, raw material availability issues and supply chain bottlenecks also persist with our customers. They are telling us they have higher demand and could ship more if not for these issues. There is no doubt we view demand as strong, and we expect this to continue even with the economic obstacles most companies are facing. And keep in mind, the fourth quarter will have 3 less shipping days than the third and fourth quarter comparisons will be against last year's all-time quarterly record for the industry. Regarding the box plant acquisition Mark mentioned, last week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Advance Packaging Corporation, an independent corrugated products producer, in a cash-free transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, PCA will acquire a modern full-line 500,000 square foot corrugated products facility located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The transaction is structured as a purchase of assets resulting in a full step-up of the assets to fair market value. This acquisition is consistent with one of the key strategic focus areas we've discussed many times regarding increasing our vertical integration of containerboard through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions. After completion of the acquisition, our containerboard integration is expected to increase by almost 80,000 tons. This also will allow for further optimization and enhancement of our mill capacity and box plant operations as well as other benefits and synergies that we expect to begin realizing soon after closing. Although we won't get into financial details at this point, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings immediately with a bottom line purchase price multiple similar to the average of our last 4 acquisitions. Closing, subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approval is expected later this quarter, and we will finance the transaction with available cash on hand. Advance Packaging is a well-capitalized full-service provider of corrugated packaging products, including high-end graphics retail displays, sustainable shipping containers and protective packaging. They utilize state-of-the-art technology, structural and graphic design and engineering capabilities and an ISTA-certified test laboratory to provide customers a solution for nearly any packaging need. With a commitment to continuous improvement, innovation and safety in their operations, Advance Packaging is a great strategic fit for PCA and our culture with an excellent management team, highly skilled and dedicated employees and an outstanding reputation in the marketplace. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter, was $18 million with sales of $150 million or a 12% margin compared to third quarter 2020 EBITDA of $17 million and sales of $178 million or 9% margin. Prices and mix were up 4% from last year's third quarter and also moved 4% higher from the second and into the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. As we mentioned last quarter, with finished goods inventory now at optimal levels for the Paper business, sales volume, which was 19% below last year's level, is fairly reflective of our production capability. As I said earlier, while the Jackson number-1 machine is running medium, we will continue to service our paper customers' needs from both of the International Falls machines, which are capable of producing all of the Jackson paper grades. While we've maintained our capability to produce uncoated freesheet on both machines at Jackson, we'll continue to monitor market conditions and run our paper system accordingly. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $284 million, with free cash flow of $134 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $150 million, common stock dividends totaled $95 million, $68 million for federal and state income tax payments, pension and other post-employment benefit contributions of $51 million and net interest payments of $7 million. During the third quarter, we issued $700 million of 30-year 3.05% notes and used the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5%, $700 million 2023 notes in early October. This transaction will lower our average annual cash interest rate from 3.8% to 3.4%, lower our annual interest expense by $11 million per year and extend our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. Based on the timing of closing the new bonds in September and the redemption of the old bonds occurring in October, our quarter end cash on hand balance included the new bond proceeds. Excluding this transaction, our quarter end cash on hand balance was just over $1 billion or $1.2 billion, including marketable securities, with liquidity at September 30 of $1.5 billion. Our planned annual maintenance expense for the quarter is still expected to be about $0.41 per share or about $0.06 per share, primarily due to the DeRidder mill outage. This will result in a negative impact of $0.25 per share moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and $0.18 per share higher than last year's fourth quarter. Finally, as Mark mentioned previously, we continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track. While we are managing to keep the key milestones of our more significant projects on schedule, our capital spending across the entire company is now expected to come in below the range we provided previously. We currently expect to end the year with total capital spending around $550 million. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to implement our previously announced price increases for domestic containerboard, corrugated packaging and paper. And we'll also expect average export containerboard prices to move higher. Packaging segment volume will be lower due to 3 less shipping days as well as the scheduled outage at our DeRidder mill and Paper segment volume would be lower as the Jackson mill is not expected to produce any paper grades. With higher energy prices and anticipated colder weather, energy costs will increase. Wood costs, especially in our Southern mill system, will be higher due to the previous wet weather. Low inventory and high demand will also impact wood. We also expect inflation to continue with most of the other operating converting costs, along with higher freight and logistics expenses. And lastly, as Bob mentioned, we expect scheduled outage cost to be approximately $0.25 per share higher than the third quarter. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.04 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Josh, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America.\nJohn Babcock: This is actually John Babcock on the line for George. The first question I just wanted to touch on. I was wondering, it looks like your price realizations in 3Q were a bit higher than we had expected. I was just wondering especially given the timing of the last increase, obviously, primarily in August, I was just wondering if you might be able to kind of comment on how much realization you had in the quarter from that August increase?\nMark Kowlzan: Tom, why don't you go ahead with that one?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. Well, keep in mind, the third quarter included some bleed in from the second increase plus the timing of the third increase. Nothing really has changed in our timing. We typically roll these in over a 90-day period. But in this particular case, given the timing, yes, we probably did realize a little bit more in the third quarter for this particular increase.\nJohn Babcock: Okay. Great. And then could you provide some color on how the early 4Q bookings look so far?\nTom Hassfurther: The bookings are coming in right now about flat to a year ago. But keep in mind, a year ago, we were up 13%. So I think we're off to a very good start in the fourth quarter and maintaining volume levels that were exorbitantly high last fourth quarter.\nJohn Babcock: All right, great. And then the last question before I turn it over. I was just wondering if you could talk about the impact that labor and supply chain shortages have had on your demand and inventory trends?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, it's hard to put it in exact numbers. As I said, demand remains very good and very strong. However, a lot of our customers, along with ourselves, are suffering from what really is an American commerce issue related to labor, transportation, supply chain issues, et cetera. And it's a mixed bag. I mean we've got some segments of our customer base who are more impacted by materials or chemicals or resins or whatever the case might be as long -- as well as the labor issue. We, of course, as I mentioned, are suffering from many of the same things. And even some of our suppliers have indicated that they're concerned about their ability to keep up with our demand. So it's something that's going on across the entire American landscape as well as, quite frankly, the global landscape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies.\nJohn Dunigan: This is John Dunigan in on for Phil. I hope you're all doing well. I was wondering if you could comment on how much medium can the J1 mill can produce per year now? And how much uncoated freesheet produced on the mill either in 2020 or just first half of this year? And then you noted, Mark, that there will be maybe some further investments required to permanently produce the medium on the J1 and possibly make it more efficient. Could you just provide a little bit more color on that and maybe discuss if there's any more increase in medium capacity after those investments if you do decide to do it?\nMark Kowlzan: Currently, on an annualized basis with what we're doing on J1, it's capable of producing about 100,000 tons a year of medium, in that range, based on the fiber availability we have with the DLK that we have and then the balance of the craft fiber. We've obviously, as we've done many times, we've studied these things years in advance. We have a pretty good idea of what we would do under different circumstances if we chose to ramp the machine up in the future. But I think, as I said earlier on the call, the fact that we're actually running medium right now is a really good opportunity for us to study all of the unit operations around the paper machine within the mill system to look at the entire balance of the mill and how it would play out in the future with the work we're doing on J3 machine. And where, ultimately, the Jackson mill goes in terms of producing containerboard. Right now, we also mentioned we have not given up the capability to produce paper on either machine, the J3 machine. Once it undergoes its outage next spring, we'll not be able to go back to paper after that. But J1 machine remains a flexible machine, and we'll just look at our market opportunities and utilize that machine as it is. Again, the machine is an extremely -- highly efficient, very good quality machine and has a lot of opportunity to help us provide our future needs for our customers as we grow with our box plant customers in the future. I'm not going to talk about capital estimates. Again, it's -- I consider that more of a proprietary situation.\nJohn Dunigan: Understood. Appreciate the details. And one more, just -- if you could maybe talk about what percentage of your energy is produced internally? Obviously, recognizing that you're a lot more virgin-based than some of your peers. And then maybe give us some idea of how exposed you are to nat gas and if you have any hedges in place or typically implement?\nMark Kowlzan: I don't have the current numbers. If you think about traditionally, we're in that -- somewhere around 70% if you include black liquor and wood waste within a mill, that's traditionally what you're going to see in the industry with a fully integrated mill that's got black liquor and wood waste capability with combination boilers. Natural gas, obviously, is the big play that the country is seeing right now and quite frankly, the world, and we're exposed to that also. So Bob, do you want to add any color on the natural gas piece? But again, it's not a lot to add, but whether it's impacting us.\nBob Mundy: I'm sorry, it's a big number going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Obviously, it's probably close to $0.10 hit and it's primarily due to prices that everyone is aware of, but you also have an impact from the seasonal aspect from colder months in the latter part of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Roxland with Truist Securities.\nAlex Liscum: This is Alex Liscum sitting in for Mike Roxland this morning. Just a quick question on virgin wood costs. Given the wet weather and the lack of transportation or increasing costs around transportation, you noted on your last call in 2Q that you haven't been able to start your winter wood build yet. Have you made any progress over 3Q? And if you can quantify it, where do your inventories stand right now? And how much more are you paying relative to last year?\nMark Kowlzan: I think we're seeing some relief in the Louisiana and the Mississippi, Tennessee wood Basin right now compared to where we were this summer. The Southeast, in particular, the Georgia, Florida, Southern Alabama, wood baskets remain under pressure from the wet weather and also the demand because of that. The winter wood build has preceded a lot better than I had hoped in the Louisiana and the at our Counce mill in Tennessee. We're nowhere near where we want to be or should be at this time of the year, but we're much improved from where we were 3 months ago. The -- again, Valdosta as an example, and Jackson mill as an example, have a ways to go. And again, there's a lot of competition in those wood baskets, but I'm not going to get into the actual numbers, except to say that it's been a long time since I've seen the entire system in the southern states under this much pressure at this time of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research.\nMark Weintraub: First, just on the Jackson mill. Is there any more color or help you can give us as to where the mill is now from a kind of a total production versus what you've laid out? And maybe we'll keep J3 to the -- sorry, the smaller machine to the side right now, how much incremental production when you move forward on the project you might get? And also, I know you had high costs initially. Where are you in terms of getting the costs relative to where they eventually can get? And any color there would be very appreciated.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. I think we've talked all along J3 machine in terms of supplying what we needed and trying to balance the input costs because they were higher. On an annualized basis, the J3 machine has been producing -- use 400,000 tons is a good number if you want to, probably about 100,000 tons a quarter, give or take. And so that's probably a good number to use for your math. If you want to add the annualized production of number-1 machine, that would be 100,000 tons. So again, on an annualized basis, Jackson is producing 500,000 tons of containerboard now at the mill. Again, I'm not going to get into specific costs. We have reduced in a very appropriate manner the cost that we can control with the unit operations that we have to work with. The big cost takeout will come next Spring as we do the really big phase work on the machine conversion and get the productivity up significantly. And when that improvement is made, you'll see a rather big step change in cost reduction. And then the final step change will come in the final phase the following year when we finish up the work on J3. Now again, as we look at J1 and we understand what that would imply, it depends on how much medium you would need in the future. And this goes back to what we said for the better part of the last 1.5 decades, you can convert anything to do anything, but there's a capital price for it. And so on an incremental cost if we're producing 100,000 tons today with appropriate capital, we could supply a significant amount of incremental medium off of that machine in future years if we chose to spend the capital. And so I look at Jackson as a tremendous opportunity. We've said this before, when the work is done on J3, the Jackson machine -- the J3 machine appropriately will be in the category of about a 700,000 ton a year machine capable asset in the next few years. And then that would leave the number-1 machine to balance out our growth opportunity in the box plant system. And so if we're producing 100,000 tons on an annual basis today and you assume you ramp that up, the Jackson mill becomes a significant containerboard producer, if we so choose to and we grow with our demand. But it has a very good opportunity to be one of our low-cost mills over the future years with the appropriate capital.\nMark Weintraub: Great. That's very helpful. And then just shifting gears, just trying to understand the bridging from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Obviously, you had a very good third quarter relative to your initial expectations and everybody else's. In the fourth quarter, you basically are pointing to like a $0.65 reduction in earnings. You called out the $0.25 from maintenance. I think, Bob, you mentioned like $0.10 specific to energy. And then there are a number of other costs, wood, freight, et cetera. At the same time, I guess I would have thought you still would have been getting some more pricing from the August containerboard flowing into boxes. Is there any kind of additional help you can give us to understand why the -- why there be as much of a decline, 4Q versus 3Q? I assume it's mostly costs. And then to the extent that it is, is there a way you can help us parse how much of that might be a seasonal impact, especially in this unusual environment? And so that there's the likelihood of recovery as we get into more seasonally favorable periods versus what may be more systemic changes that one's got to keep an eye on.\nBob Mundy: Yes, Mark, this is Bob. As you know, third quarter to fourth quarter is always a negative movement sequentially. It's just -- going back probably as far as you want to look, it's -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the seasonal things you see going on with wood, energy and some other items. What's happening this quarter -- yes, we are certainly getting additional price improvement or we expect to from the previously announced price increases in the Packaging segment, but we also have a -- the volume situation is not as -- is a little bit more unfavorable, primarily on the mill side of things with the outage at DeRidder and the fact that we actually expect our inventories to go down as opposed to build inventory. So you always have to consider that inventory change and how that impacts your cost and your cost absorption. Certainly, freight is a bit higher than it normally would be this time of year. And then those operating costs, like I mentioned, what was going on with energy, with wood fiber and the things that Mark was speaking to with trying to get inventories where they need to be and competing with others, forest products producers that are trying to do the same thing in that part of the country along with shortages, just trying to get drivers to get wood and bring it to the mill. Those costs are up a similar amount to what energy will be. We expect to be very busy in the box plants again in the fourth quarter. And with what we're already struggling with relative to labor availability, just like most other companies are, paying additional overtime, doing what you have to do to get the volume out of the door. That's higher than normal. And also just overall repairs and materials, other fixed cost type things. It's never seen it quite like this. We talked about the maintenance outages being $0.25 a share negative. And we have some things relative to this capital spending in our box plants that we hope to bring several projects on board in the fourth quarter, and that results in some noncapital implementation expense. That's a little bit higher than normal, but it's for a good reason, obviously. So when you net all of those things, Mark, it's -- you're right, it comes to $0.65, which for us is certainly not out of line. If you look at the second half of our results versus the consensus numbers, it looks like we'll end up the year, the second half, $0.25 better than what anyone thought. It's just the timing of the -- between the quarters. Maybe we had a lot more price appreciation in the third than people were realizing and there was more of that in the fourth. I'm not sure, but that's sort of how we see the sequential numbers moving.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.\nAdam Josephson: Congratulations on another very good quarter. Bob, just one follow-up on Mark's previous question about the 3Q and the beat versus your guidance of $0.32. Can you help us with how much of the third increase you realized? And consequently, how much more you're expecting in the fourth quarter per your guidance?\nBob Mundy: No, I don't think we'll get into that level of detail. I think you just have to think about what Tom said. And certainly, I think there was more than what people were assuming together with -- as you know, we've always done a really good job of executing and bringing that price to the bottom line as quickly as possible, and I think it was just a great effort during the quarter.\nAdam Josephson: Got it. I appreciate that, Bob. On OCC, whoever wants to take this, can you just talk about what you're -- I know you're not a big buyer of it compared to some peers, but what you're expecting in the fourth quarter? I assume you're expecting some decline. I'm just wondering if you're thinking that just seasonal or there something more than that or what you're seeing in the OCC market at the moment?\nBob Mundy: Yes. I think on average, Adam, if you look at the average of 3Q versus 4Q, 4Q will be higher. I think because we're exiting the third quarter, beginning the fourth at a higher cost. Although as the quarter goes on, I think we're -- the costs look like or the price looks like, it will be fairly stable, maybe slightly lower. But like I said, on average, it's a headwind, 3Q to 4Q.\nAdam Josephson: Got it, Bob. And Tom, just in terms of what happened in the third quarter, the box demand, I mean, you outgrew the market. Once again, the market was obviously flat. I think that came as a surprise to most people who follow the industry. And I know you talked about this -- the labor constraints that many of your customers are facing. I mean do you have a reason to think those constraints are going to go away anytime soon? Or is this just you think a feature of this economy now, and we're going to be dealing with this for a considerable period ahead?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Adam, as I mentioned to you, it's an American problem, an international problem, you name it. I mean it's -- and if I could predict exactly when this was going to end, I'd be -- I'd probably be doing something different than what I'm doing right now. The fact of the matter is that what makes us so hard to predict right now is the fact that every company is dealing with this, whether it's ours, whether it's our customers, whether it's other industries, whatever the case might be, we're all competing in a labor market that's incredibly tight. As I said before, I mean, we're also competing with the government here, which makes it even much more difficult. But there are shortages everywhere and the demand remains very high. So is this going to be -- is this going to end in the short term? It depends on what you determine short term is, I don't see it ending anytime soon. It's going to continue well into next year, and where it settles out, I don't know. The one thing that's been very evident is that the consumer has changed a lot of their habits. And that's been good for our business. That's not going to change ever again, I don't think. And quite frankly, we've also got customers that have been asking for alternative products to their plastics, which is still a great opportunity for the industry. But we've had a difficulty being able to address that right now just based on all the other demand. So I think when you look at all the trends, it's darn positive going forward.\nAdam Josephson: Got it. And Bob, can you give us any specifics on the acquisition that you announced, sales, purchase price multiple, et cetera?\nBob Mundy: No. I think as Tom said, we're not getting into the financial details right now. But -- so that's all we're going to talk about on the call today on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: When you finish the work at J3 and then maybe factoring in the acquisition, is it possible to say where your integration rate in containerboard could shake out at? And sort of how you would think about that versus maybe an optimal run rate integration rate for PCA?\nMark Kowlzan: The easiest way to do it is just assume that we're always going to -- our goal is always to be fully integrated. And how you define fully integrated? For the last number of years, we've always moved some tons to the outside market internationally and domestically. And we will probably do that going forward. Tom, why don't you add some color?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. Anthony, I think the way to look at it is this, we're going to run to demand. We've always told you that. So whatever our integration level is, is going to remain essentially the same. There's really -- we have additional demand in the export market. But as I mentioned many times, the domestic market has shrunk so dramatically that it's not just a matter of just going out and saying, I can go sell a bunch of people in the domestic market. There is no domestic market to speak of. So -- and those that supply it are going to stick with what they've got, just like we are sticking with what we have. We're not a big player in the export market. We've been dealing with the same customers for decades now, and that's what we intend to do. So we will grow into our capabilities, and that's why, as Mark mentioned, we will still have the capability to produce white at the mill. And as our paper demand might dictate, we could swing back to that if we needed to. So our objective, as Mark said, remains exactly the same. We will be a fully integrated company.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Tom, you made an interesting comment on plastic substitution. And obviously, probably not the biggest part of your business and you may not be able to even sort of meet that demand given some of the constraints you and customers are facing, but can you just talk a little bit about what plastic products customers are looking at substituting out of or what customers or end markets these opportunities are cropping up in? Just any kind of general commentary would be helpful.\nTom Hassfurther: I'll just give you an example real quickly. If you receive apparel in a plastic bag through the e-commerce network, typically, those things arrive and they're pretty nasty and people -- consumers have become alerted to what plastics does to the environment and the lack of recyclability in plastics, they're working on it. But obviously, it's a very, very low number compared to corrugated, which probably is the best sustainability story in the world, perhaps. And so they're looking for on conversion opportunities to get out of that stuff to satisfy really what are consumer demands even more so than their own demands. That's just one small example of what's going on, but all of the companies that sell to consumers have been very alerted to the fact that consumers want a recyclable package, a good sustainability story and they want to be good stewards of the environment. And consequently, there's going to be more opportunities going forward for those kind of conversions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cleve Rueckert with UBS.\nCleve Rueckert: Most might have been asked and answered. I just wanted to quickly sort of on a higher level on costs. We calculated about a 2% sequential decline in packaging costs ex G&A on a per ton basis. Did you get some relief in the quarter? I mean, I know you talked about running more efficiently and I'm just wanting to sort of more broadly if there are any areas of improvement.\nBob Mundy: Yes, Cleve, this is Bob. I'm not sure how you calculate your cost. I mean, our cost actually went up. So I really don't know how to answer that question. You've got to be careful when you look at costs, if you're taking them at a high level and just if you like subtracting EBITDA from sales or whatever you may be doing, you also have to take into consideration inventory change tons that were going on between the 2 periods that you're comparing. So you get your denominator right. So again, I really don't know how to answer because our costs went up.\nCleve Rueckert: Okay. So cost was up sequentially on a percent basis. And then just a quick follow-up on containerboard inventories. Sorry if I missed it earlier, did you say that at the end of the quarter or in the quarter, you've got to target and then you expect to consume some in the fourth quarter. Is that the right read there?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. We got to what our average where we like to be from weeks of supply basis, sort of our average what it was for the last 5 years. If you exclude that -- the record low of September of last year, that's just not a normal situation. So we -- with the help of the Jackson mill, obviously, we got to where we want it to be from weeks of supply basis, which -- but we have this big DeRidder outage coming up in the fourth quarter. Demand is going to be very strong. So right now, on paper, our inventories would actually decline by the time we hit the end of the year.\nOperator:  Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today on the call, and I look forward to talking with everybody at the end of January for our full year and fourth quarter call. Stay well, stay safe and have a nice holiday season.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. We continue to get excellent realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.40 per share above the third quarter of 2020 and up $0.55 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.18 per share compared to the third quarter of 2020, and up $0.06 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. As Mark mentioned, we achieved a new all-time record for containerboard shipments with continued strong demand in our box plants as well as our domestic and export containerboard markets. We had record third quarter corrugated product shipments, which were up 2.3% in total and per workday over last year's very strong third quarter. Through the first 3 quarters of 2021, our box shipment volume was up 6.7% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 4.5%. In addition to supplying the record internal needs of our box plants, our outside sales volume of containerboard was 73,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 37,000 tons higher than the second quarter of 2021. Regarding our third quarter demand and our outlook, I'd like to reemphasize some points I made on previous earning calls and what Mark alluded to earlier the same issues that impact our ability to get more volume out of our box plants like labor shortages, truck availability, driver shortages, raw material availability issues and supply chain bottlenecks also persist with our customers. They are telling us they have higher demand and could ship more if not for these issues. There is no doubt we view demand as strong, and we expect this to continue even with the economic obstacles most companies are facing. And keep in mind, the fourth quarter will have 3 less shipping days than the third and fourth quarter comparisons will be against last year's all-time quarterly record for the industry. Regarding the box plant acquisition Mark mentioned, last week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Advance Packaging Corporation, an independent corrugated products producer, in a cash-free transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, PCA will acquire a modern full-line 500,000 square foot corrugated products facility located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The transaction is structured as a purchase of assets resulting in a full step-up of the assets to fair market value. This acquisition is consistent with one of the key strategic focus areas we've discussed many times regarding increasing our vertical integration of containerboard through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions. After completion of the acquisition, our containerboard integration is expected to increase by almost 80,000 tons. This also will allow for further optimization and enhancement of our mill capacity and box plant operations as well as other benefits and synergies that we expect to begin realizing soon after closing. Although we won't get into financial details at this point, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings immediately with a bottom line purchase price multiple similar to the average of our last 4 acquisitions. Closing, subject to certain customary conditions and regulatory approval is expected later this quarter, and we will finance the transaction with available cash on hand. Advance Packaging is a well-capitalized full-service provider of corrugated packaging products, including high-end graphics retail displays, sustainable shipping containers and protective packaging. They utilize state-of-the-art technology, structural and graphic design and engineering capabilities and an ISTA-certified test laboratory to provide customers a solution for nearly any packaging need. With a commitment to continuous improvement, innovation and safety in their operations, Advance Packaging is a great strategic fit for PCA and our culture with an excellent management team, highly skilled and dedicated employees and an outstanding reputation in the marketplace. I'll now turn it back to Mark. Yes. Well, keep in mind, the third quarter included some bleed in from the second increase plus the timing of the third increase. Nothing really has changed in our timing. We typically roll these in over a 90-day period. But in this particular case, given the timing, yes, we probably did realize a little bit more in the third quarter for this particular increase. The bookings are coming in right now about flat to a year ago. But keep in mind, a year ago, we were up 13%. So I think we're off to a very good start in the fourth quarter and maintaining volume levels that were exorbitantly high last fourth quarter. Well, it's hard to put it in exact numbers. As I said, demand remains very good and very strong. However, a lot of our customers, along with ourselves, are suffering from what really is an American commerce issue related to labor, transportation, supply chain issues, et cetera. And it's a mixed bag. I mean we've got some segments of our customer base who are more impacted by materials or chemicals or resins or whatever the case might be as long -- as well as the labor issue. We, of course, as I mentioned, are suffering from many of the same things. And even some of our suppliers have indicated that they're concerned about their ability to keep up with our demand. So it's something that's going on across the entire American landscape as well as, quite frankly, the global landscape. Well, Adam, as I mentioned to you, it's an American problem, an international problem, you name it. I mean it's -- and if I could predict exactly when this was going to end, I'd be -- I'd probably be doing something different than what I'm doing right now. The fact of the matter is that what makes us so hard to predict right now is the fact that every company is dealing with this, whether it's ours, whether it's our customers, whether it's other industries, whatever the case might be, we're all competing in a labor market that's incredibly tight. As I said before, I mean, we're also competing with the government here, which makes it even much more difficult. But there are shortages everywhere and the demand remains very high. So is this going to be -- is this going to end in the short term? It depends on what you determine short term is, I don't see it ending anytime soon. It's going to continue well into next year, and where it settles out, I don't know. The one thing that's been very evident is that the consumer has changed a lot of their habits. And that's been good for our business. That's not going to change ever again, I don't think. And quite frankly, we've also got customers that have been asking for alternative products to their plastics, which is still a great opportunity for the industry. But we've had a difficulty being able to address that right now just based on all the other demand. So I think when you look at all the trends, it's darn positive going forward. Yes. Anthony, I think the way to look at it is this, we're going to run to demand. We've always told you that. So whatever our integration level is, is going to remain essentially the same. There's really -- we have additional demand in the export market. But as I mentioned many times, the domestic market has shrunk so dramatically that it's not just a matter of just going out and saying, I can go sell a bunch of people in the domestic market. There is no domestic market to speak of. So -- and those that supply it are going to stick with what they've got, just like we are sticking with what we have. We're not a big player in the export market. We've been dealing with the same customers for decades now, and that's what we intend to do. So we will grow into our capabilities, and that's why, as Mark mentioned, we will still have the capability to produce white at the mill. And as our paper demand might dictate, we could swing back to that if we needed to. So our objective, as Mark said, remains exactly the same. We will be a fully integrated company. I'll just give you an example real quickly. If you receive apparel in a plastic bag through the e-commerce network, typically, those things arrive and they're pretty nasty and people -- consumers have become alerted to what plastics does to the environment and the lack of recyclability in plastics, they're working on it. But obviously, it's a very, very low number compared to corrugated, which probably is the best sustainability story in the world, perhaps. And so they're looking for on conversion opportunities to get out of that stuff to satisfy really what are consumer demands even more so than their own demands. That's just one small example of what's going on, but all of the companies that sell to consumers have been very alerted to the fact that consumers want a recyclable package, a good sustainability story and they want to be good stewards of the environment. And consequently, there's going to be more opportunities going forward for those kind of conversions."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and again, thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I will be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide more details. After that, I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $251 million or $2.63 per share. Excluding the special items, third quarter 2021 net income was $257 million or $2.69 per share compared to third quarter 2020 net income of $149 million or $1.57 per share. Third quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter, excluding the special items, was $464 million in 2021 and $323 million in 2020. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.06 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities. While last year's third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.11 per share that were related primarily to the impact of Hurricane Laura on the DeRidder, Louisiana mill. Details of all the special items for the third quarter of 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $1.12 per share increase in third quarter 2021 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.58 and volume $0.62 in our Packaging segment; higher production volume of $0.06 and prices and mix of $0.05 in our Paper segment; and lower nonoperating pension expense, $0.03; and lower interest expense, $0.01. Items were partially offset by operating costs, which were $0.84 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.10 per share higher. For the last several quarters, freight and logistics costs have risen and were $0.23 per share higher compared to last year, driven by significant increases in fuel costs, tight truck supply, driver shortages and a higher mix of spot pricing to keep up with box demand. And finally, scheduled outage expenses were $0.04 per share higher than last year, and sales volume in our Paper segment was lower by $0.02 per share. Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter of 2021 of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 26% versus last year's EBITDA of $324 million with sales of $1.5 billion and a 22% margin. Packaging segment demand remained strong, and the teams did a tremendous job of implementing our previously announced containerboard and corrugated products price increases. The containerboard mills set an all-time quarterly sales volume record and our box plants set new third quarter records for total corrugated product shipments as well as shipments per day. By utilizing the capability of both machines at our Jackson, Alabama mill to produce containerboard, we were able to reach our desired inventory levels to better serve our customer demand, help minimize the transportation challenges we continue to experience and build some inventory ahead of the DeRidder mills' fourth quarter outage. We manage very effectively the execution of numerous initiatives and capital projects to reduce costs through efficiency, productivity and optimization improvements across our manufacturing locations. We continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material, equipment and labor availability issues to keep our customers supplied in their needs and their capital projects on track. With no relief from the supply chain obstacles that we, our customers and our suppliers continue to face, along with unprecedented inflation-related challenges, the combination of all of these efforts are critical to our success going forward. The improvements in execution our employees deliver constantly across many fronts is what allows us to continuously improve margins. After successfully completing the planned maintenance outage at the Jackson mill during the third quarter, the mill restarted with the number-1 machine making corrugated medium rather than uncoated freesheet grades, utilizing a mix of virgin craft and DLK fiber based on the needs of our customers. This was required to help meet continued strong demand from our box plant customers, meet our targeted inventory levels prior to year-end and help supply the needs of our box plant acquisition that we anticipate acquiring later this quarter. Similar to the number-3 machine at Jackson, the smaller number-1 machine is highly efficient. It's a versatile machine and with minimal capital required to repurpose a deinking plant to handle DLK. The machine was very quickly able to produce high-quality medium for the box plants. Although still capable of producing uncoated freesheet products, we plan to continue producing medium on the machine over the next several months as our internal and external packaging demand warrants. This gives us the opportunity to further evaluate the machine's capabilities and to process -- and the process changes that might be required to potentially produce medium permanently in a cost-effective manner. We'll also use the period to further refine our estimates and assumptions to fully understand the potential of the entire mill to produce containerboard on both machines at their optimal cost and quality. This will also allow us to evaluate our strategic containerboard supply capabilities for providing the necessary runway to grow our integrated downstream box demand. We are committed to being fully integrated, and we have a track record of ramping up our internal capacity according to our customers' demand requirements. The previously announced conversion of the J3 machine to linerboard remains on track with no changes to the schedule we discussed on last quarter's call. We'll continue to serve our paper customers with both machines at our International Falls mill, which is capable of producing all of Jackson's paper grades as well as available inventory produced on the number-1 machine at Jackson. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales, our corrugated business and the box plant acquisition that I mentioned. Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the third quarter, was $18 million with sales of $150 million or a 12% margin compared to third quarter 2020 EBITDA of $17 million and sales of $178 million or 9% margin. Prices and mix were up 4% from last year's third quarter and also moved 4% higher from the second and into the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. As we mentioned last quarter, with finished goods inventory now at optimal levels for the Paper business, sales volume, which was 19% below last year's level, is fairly reflective of our production capability. As I said earlier, while the Jackson number-1 machine is running medium, we will continue to service our paper customers' needs from both of the International Falls machines, which are capable of producing all of the Jackson paper grades. While we've maintained our capability to produce uncoated freesheet on both machines at Jackson, we'll continue to monitor market conditions and run our paper system accordingly. With that, I'll turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the third into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to implement our previously announced price increases for domestic containerboard, corrugated packaging and paper. And we'll also expect average export containerboard prices to move higher. Packaging segment volume will be lower due to 3 less shipping days as well as the scheduled outage at our DeRidder mill and Paper segment volume would be lower as the Jackson mill is not expected to produce any paper grades. With higher energy prices and anticipated colder weather, energy costs will increase. Wood costs, especially in our Southern mill system, will be higher due to the previous wet weather. Low inventory and high demand will also impact wood. We also expect inflation to continue with most of the other operating converting costs, along with higher freight and logistics expenses. And lastly, as Bob mentioned, we expect scheduled outage cost to be approximately $0.25 per share higher than the third quarter. Considering these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.04 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Josh, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please. Tom, why don't you go ahead with that one? Currently, on an annualized basis with what we're doing on J1, it's capable of producing about 100,000 tons a year of medium, in that range, based on the fiber availability we have with the DLK that we have and then the balance of the craft fiber. We've obviously, as we've done many times, we've studied these things years in advance. We have a pretty good idea of what we would do under different circumstances if we chose to ramp the machine up in the future. But I think, as I said earlier on the call, the fact that we're actually running medium right now is a really good opportunity for us to study all of the unit operations around the paper machine within the mill system to look at the entire balance of the mill and how it would play out in the future with the work we're doing on J3 machine. And where, ultimately, the Jackson mill goes in terms of producing containerboard. Right now, we also mentioned we have not given up the capability to produce paper on either machine, the J3 machine. Once it undergoes its outage next spring, we'll not be able to go back to paper after that. But J1 machine remains a flexible machine, and we'll just look at our market opportunities and utilize that machine as it is. Again, the machine is an extremely -- highly efficient, very good quality machine and has a lot of opportunity to help us provide our future needs for our customers as we grow with our box plant customers in the future. I'm not going to talk about capital estimates. Again, it's -- I consider that more of a proprietary situation. I don't have the current numbers. If you think about traditionally, we're in that -- somewhere around 70% if you include black liquor and wood waste within a mill, that's traditionally what you're going to see in the industry with a fully integrated mill that's got black liquor and wood waste capability with combination boilers. Natural gas, obviously, is the big play that the country is seeing right now and quite frankly, the world, and we're exposed to that also. So Bob, do you want to add any color on the natural gas piece? But again, it's not a lot to add, but whether it's impacting us. I think we're seeing some relief in the Louisiana and the Mississippi, Tennessee wood Basin right now compared to where we were this summer. The Southeast, in particular, the Georgia, Florida, Southern Alabama, wood baskets remain under pressure from the wet weather and also the demand because of that. The winter wood build has preceded a lot better than I had hoped in the Louisiana and the at our Counce mill in Tennessee. We're nowhere near where we want to be or should be at this time of the year, but we're much improved from where we were 3 months ago. The -- again, Valdosta as an example, and Jackson mill as an example, have a ways to go. And again, there's a lot of competition in those wood baskets, but I'm not going to get into the actual numbers, except to say that it's been a long time since I've seen the entire system in the southern states under this much pressure at this time of the year. Yes. I think we've talked all along J3 machine in terms of supplying what we needed and trying to balance the input costs because they were higher. On an annualized basis, the J3 machine has been producing -- use 400,000 tons is a good number if you want to, probably about 100,000 tons a quarter, give or take. And so that's probably a good number to use for your math. If you want to add the annualized production of number-1 machine, that would be 100,000 tons. So again, on an annualized basis, Jackson is producing 500,000 tons of containerboard now at the mill. Again, I'm not going to get into specific costs. We have reduced in a very appropriate manner the cost that we can control with the unit operations that we have to work with. The big cost takeout will come next Spring as we do the really big phase work on the machine conversion and get the productivity up significantly. And when that improvement is made, you'll see a rather big step change in cost reduction. And then the final step change will come in the final phase the following year when we finish up the work on J3. Now again, as we look at J1 and we understand what that would imply, it depends on how much medium you would need in the future. And this goes back to what we said for the better part of the last 1.5 decades, you can convert anything to do anything, but there's a capital price for it. And so on an incremental cost if we're producing 100,000 tons today with appropriate capital, we could supply a significant amount of incremental medium off of that machine in future years if we chose to spend the capital. And so I look at Jackson as a tremendous opportunity. We've said this before, when the work is done on J3, the Jackson machine -- the J3 machine appropriately will be in the category of about a 700,000 ton a year machine capable asset in the next few years. And then that would leave the number-1 machine to balance out our growth opportunity in the box plant system. And so if we're producing 100,000 tons on an annual basis today and you assume you ramp that up, the Jackson mill becomes a significant containerboard producer, if we so choose to and we grow with our demand. But it has a very good opportunity to be one of our low-cost mills over the future years with the appropriate capital. The easiest way to do it is just assume that we're always going to -- our goal is always to be fully integrated. And how you define fully integrated? For the last number of years, we've always moved some tons to the outside market internationally and domestically. And we will probably do that going forward. Tom, why don't you add some color? Yes. We got to what our average where we like to be from weeks of supply basis, sort of our average what it was for the last 5 years. If you exclude that -- the record low of September of last year, that's just not a normal situation. So we -- with the help of the Jackson mill, obviously, we got to where we want it to be from weeks of supply basis, which -- but we have this big DeRidder outage coming up in the fourth quarter. Demand is going to be very strong. So right now, on paper, our inventories would actually decline by the time we hit the end of the year. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today on the call, and I look forward to talking with everybody at the end of January for our full year and fourth quarter call. Stay well, stay safe and have a nice holiday season."

            "name": "Bob Mundy",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $284 million, with free cash flow of $134 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $150 million, common stock dividends totaled $95 million, $68 million for federal and state income tax payments, pension and other post-employment benefit contributions of $51 million and net interest payments of $7 million. During the third quarter, we issued $700 million of 30-year 3.05% notes and used the proceeds from these notes to redeem our 4.5%, $700 million 2023 notes in early October. This transaction will lower our average annual cash interest rate from 3.8% to 3.4%, lower our annual interest expense by $11 million per year and extend our average debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years. Based on the timing of closing the new bonds in September and the redemption of the old bonds occurring in October, our quarter end cash on hand balance included the new bond proceeds. Excluding this transaction, our quarter end cash on hand balance was just over $1 billion or $1.2 billion, including marketable securities, with liquidity at September 30 of $1.5 billion. Our planned annual maintenance expense for the quarter is still expected to be about $0.41 per share or about $0.06 per share, primarily due to the DeRidder mill outage. This will result in a negative impact of $0.25 per share moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and $0.18 per share higher than last year's fourth quarter. Finally, as Mark mentioned previously, we continue to put tremendous effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track. While we are managing to keep the key milestones of our more significant projects on schedule, our capital spending across the entire company is now expected to come in below the range we provided previously. We currently expect to end the year with total capital spending around $550 million. I'll now turn it back to Mark. I'm sorry, it's a big number going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Obviously, it's probably close to $0.10 hit and it's primarily due to prices that everyone is aware of, but you also have an impact from the seasonal aspect from colder months in the latter part of the year. Yes, Mark, this is Bob. As you know, third quarter to fourth quarter is always a negative movement sequentially. It's just -- going back probably as far as you want to look, it's -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the seasonal things you see going on with wood, energy and some other items. What's happening this quarter -- yes, we are certainly getting additional price improvement or we expect to from the previously announced price increases in the Packaging segment, but we also have a -- the volume situation is not as -- is a little bit more unfavorable, primarily on the mill side of things with the outage at DeRidder and the fact that we actually expect our inventories to go down as opposed to build inventory. So you always have to consider that inventory change and how that impacts your cost and your cost absorption. Certainly, freight is a bit higher than it normally would be this time of year. And then those operating costs, like I mentioned, what was going on with energy, with wood fiber and the things that Mark was speaking to with trying to get inventories where they need to be and competing with others, forest products producers that are trying to do the same thing in that part of the country along with shortages, just trying to get drivers to get wood and bring it to the mill. Those costs are up a similar amount to what energy will be. We expect to be very busy in the box plants again in the fourth quarter. And with what we're already struggling with relative to labor availability, just like most other companies are, paying additional overtime, doing what you have to do to get the volume out of the door. That's higher than normal. And also just overall repairs and materials, other fixed cost type things. It's never seen it quite like this. We talked about the maintenance outages being $0.25 a share negative. And we have some things relative to this capital spending in our box plants that we hope to bring several projects on board in the fourth quarter, and that results in some noncapital implementation expense. That's a little bit higher than normal, but it's for a good reason, obviously. So when you net all of those things, Mark, it's -- you're right, it comes to $0.65, which for us is certainly not out of line. If you look at the second half of our results versus the consensus numbers, it looks like we'll end up the year, the second half, $0.25 better than what anyone thought. It's just the timing of the -- between the quarters. Maybe we had a lot more price appreciation in the third than people were realizing and there was more of that in the fourth. I'm not sure, but that's sort of how we see the sequential numbers moving. No, I don't think we'll get into that level of detail. I think you just have to think about what Tom said. And certainly, I think there was more than what people were assuming together with -- as you know, we've always done a really good job of executing and bringing that price to the bottom line as quickly as possible, and I think it was just a great effort during the quarter. Yes. I think on average, Adam, if you look at the average of 3Q versus 4Q, 4Q will be higher. I think because we're exiting the third quarter, beginning the fourth at a higher cost. Although as the quarter goes on, I think we're -- the costs look like or the price looks like, it will be fairly stable, maybe slightly lower. But like I said, on average, it's a headwind, 3Q to 4Q. No. I think as Tom said, we're not getting into the financial details right now. But -- so that's all we're going to talk about on the call today on that. Yes, Cleve, this is Bob. I'm not sure how you calculate your cost. I mean, our cost actually went up. So I really don't know how to answer that question. You've got to be careful when you look at costs, if you're taking them at a high level and just if you like subtracting EBITDA from sales or whatever you may be doing, you also have to take into consideration inventory change tons that were going on between the 2 periods that you're comparing. So you get your denominator right. So again, I really don't know how to answer because our costs went up."

Your host for today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you're ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up and then would be glad to take questions.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. As Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets. Our plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Through the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%. Driven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments. Supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year. We are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $12 million with sales of $142 million or an 8% margin compared to second quarter 2020 EBITDA of $5 million and sales of $123 million or a 4% margin. Although about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continued to implement our announced price increases. Volume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama mill down for two months during the second quarter. While this year, we ran the No. 1 machine at Jackson on paper and the No. 3 machine ran linerboard. Now that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a three machine paper system. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and will run our paper system accordingly. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations for the second quarter was $228 million with free cash flow of $97 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $131 million, common stock dividends of $95 million, cash taxes of $87 million, and net interest payments of $40 million. We ended the quarter with $972 million of cash on hand or $1.1 billion including marketable securities. Our liquidity at June 30th was just under $1.5 billion. I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. As we move from the second to the third quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard and corrugated products with one additional day for box shipments. Paper segment volume should be relatively flat primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the Jackson Mill. We will also continue to implement our previously announced price increases in both our Packaging and Paper segments.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks. Hi everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. I guess maybe to start, Mark, if - and Tom if you could talk a bit about your early 3Q bookings and shipments. What are you seeing and related point, we heard from some in the trade that lack of availability has actually impaired producers - converters ability to ship in boxes in 2Q and into 3Q? You called it out as an issue, but is that preventing you from shipping from beyond what you reported in the second quarter? Thanks and I'll have a quick follow-up after that.\nThomas Hassfurther: George, its Tom. I can tell you that going into the third quarter, our bookings and billings are running about 7% ahead of last year. Keep in mind that our comps become much tougher. So it's not as if volume has slowed down at all. It's remained incredibly robust coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and all the way through this year. I think that's why we felt quite a bit more comfortable about giving some sort of guidance going forward. Also, you asked about the some of the lack of supply in the second quarter maybe bleeding over into the third quarter. We're running lead times that are longer than we're used to and certainly longer than our customers are used to. So the demand remains very high. Trying to get it out the door is an issue more related to transportation at this stage than it is certainly about paper. We're able to take care of our own plants through our system. So that's not the issue for us, it's more transportation and I think that's reflective of most of the industry.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. Thanks, Tom. My second question if you could talk or third question really is I think the last quarter or going into 2021, you had pointed to a sequential drop-off in maintenance for the third quarter. Just if you could affirm what your maintenance schedule is for this year versus last year. I think the drop off 2Q to 3Q should be about 12%? And then lastly on cost, you flagged what cost I think particularly in the south. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing? What kind of headwind that might be for you in the third quarter and fourth quarter? Obviously, the weather has been tough and that's usually what drives higher wood costs. Thanks and good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: George, I'll take the wood cost. Obviously, we've had a very wet period of time throughout the entire Gulf Coastal region up to the southeastern states through the entire winter and spring into the summer months now. And so coupled with the high demand for pulpwood and the logistics issues with the trucking side of the equation, it's basically put the situation where it is that pulp prices are up dramatically because of those situations, but again, it's more of a weather related phenomenon than anything else. Bob, why don't you go ahead and talk about the average cost?\nRobert Mundy: Yes, George, it's about $0.11 to $0.12 help going to 2Q to 3Q on outages, which is very similar to the - our wood costs going the other direction and about the same amount.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you very much guys. Good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Wilde: Hi, good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tom.\nThomas Hassfurther: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Wilde: Mark, for my first question, I'd like to just kind of step back a little bit and I know this is a sensitive issue, but I wondered if you could just discuss kind of plans and process around leadership succession at Packaging Corp?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, we've talked about this before and as you could imagine, that's a Board level matter, but we have got the depths and the breadth of the talent across the board. That's been identified and we continue to develop. We're very confident in the talent pool we have and the Board feels the same way that. Again, we've got enormous opportunities with the talent across the entire company.\nMark Wilde: Okay. The second question I had is, if you could just walk us through the steps that you might be making if you downsize the footprint in the white paper business to a smaller capacity base and whether this involves shifts in your customer base. I think your filings in the past have pointed to two large customers.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, as you can imagine, without the Jackson No. 3 machine, we've gone ahead and exited some business over the last six months and now as you think about that as a three machine system, we're going to be supplying a smaller marketplace. So we've been able to rationalize that accordingly, but that has shifted us down to a few bigger customers, but nevertheless, the entire market for us has shifted down over the last eight years, since we've run the paper business. And so we're very confident that we'll continue to supply into that market and do it in a meaningful manner as we go forward and so -\nMark Wilde: And then finally.\nMark Kowlzan: Go ahead Mark.\nMark Wilde: I just was curious, Mark, is it possible to think about I Falls as a containerboard mill at some point. I'm just trying to think about the puts and takes. Typically, upper Midwest with a lot of hardwood, you only produce medium up there, but I just - I don't even know whether you think from an engineering standpoint that's an option at I Falls over time?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, we've said this for the better part of the last decade that you can convert anything to do anything, but there is a capital cost and there are puts and takes with transportation, logistics and then what is your intent in terms of product mix. Right now, we have a good market for the paper that's coming out of I Falls. We'll continue to run to that opportunity. We have the Jackson conversion coming on big next year that will continue to supply us with the necessary containerboard for the next few years. And I would say this, as long as the Paper business offers us an opportunity with the International Falls mill, we'll continue to take advantage of that opportunity. In the future years, if that was not the case, then we'd have to reassess the situation and look at our optionality with that asset, but trust me, it's - you have to believe that we've already done that and we have the opportunities in the files and know what we would do at any given time. So we're pretty confident that we've got a lot of flexibility.\nMark Wilde: All right, well, Boise Paper has been the gift that keeps giving. So I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens.\nMark Connelly: Thank you. Two things, just on white paper, will Jackson will be all containerboard in the second half. I'm just sort of curious how these projects affect the ability to run white there?\nMark Kowlzan: Neither Jackson will continue to run with the No. 3 machine on containerboard and at the present time, our intent is to run No. 1 machine on a paper.\nMark Connelly: Okay, so even during the project, great. And secondly, you talked in this call and previous calls about box plants debottlenecking projects. I'm just curious if with all the activity you've got going on right now and all the COVID. Are you doing as many of those projects today as normal or more than normal, less than normal?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, we're extremely pleased with the rate that we've been able to execute these projects and I'll give you an example, I mean, we did slow down a little bit last year during the 2020 period and we have become a little more targeted in what projects required the attention of the various technical organization just because of the travel restrictions and the concern for people's well-being, but this year that was ramped up to full activity and so we're continuing to execute well across the board. But I can give you an example, if you go back over the last 3.5 years, we've executed approximately at 62 of these box plants $850 million worth of capital project activity. Flexo Folder-Gluers converting equipment upgrades, major rebuilds, new corrugators, built the two new plants and so we're doing this all in-house, but the pace is ramped up in 2021 over some of 2020. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And so we currently have a great deal of activity going on at numerous plants nationwide that will continue to provide the benefits that I spoke about and that Tom spoke about. So, we're extremely pleased with the opportunities.\nMark Connelly: Fantastic. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, it looks like you're getting really rapid and significant pass-through on the board increases into boxes. Can you give us a sense, A, is it true? Are you getting more than full pass-through and is this type of environment where you're able to achieve that? Can you give us a read on how much more is there to come in the third quarter and just wanted to confirm, are you including any of the pending August increase or is that excluded from the guide?\nThomas Hassfurther: Mark, this is Tom. Let me just comment, we say very little about our price increase, but this isn't any different than the price increases we've had in the past. It's a very disciplined approach that we do. We roll them in over approximately the 90-day period. We have local accounts to go in at a maybe a quicker rate than some of our contractual accounts. If you want to look at the three price increases kind of separately, the first price increase was effectively done, and but you do have some bleed over depending on contracts and things like that, timing, those can be impacted. Second price increase, the same way, it rolls out over a whole 90-day period. Third price increase hasn't been reflected yet in pulp and paper. So obviously, we have raised prices to our independent customers and our linerboard and medium customers domestically. Those are in place, but the lion's share of the price increase, which goes through boxes, again, that will flow through over a 90-day period. So virtually, none of that would be reflected at this stage in the third quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, one of the questions, the impact from volume you note I believe it was $0.74, which is $90 million, $100 million if we think of it pre-tax, which seems like a really big number relative to an extra 100,000, 120,000 tons of board and boxes being shipped. Just trying to understand how we get to that number? Is there some sort of mix element included in here as well or and I realize it's kind of an esoteric question but any help there would be appreciated?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, Mark, yes, I mean, for starters, if you just look at the raw volume, I mean the raw volume is up dramatically and as we came out of COVID last year into that fourth quarter, the question mark and it was a big question mark for everybody was will that level of volume be maintained going into 2021 and then throughout 2021. So far, we've maintained very close to those kind of numbers and I think it's just indicative of what the market is right now and the changes that have taken place from consumer habits. Also, I'll remind you that last year during COVID of course you know from a mix standpoint, our display business had basically gone to nothing because of the shutdowns and no shopping in brick and mortar and things like that sort. So that end of the business had dried up quite a bit and that's back now and then also, we've had good cost controls in terms of getting this volume out. As we've indicated, a lot of these capital projects are paying off. So we can - we're very comfortable with the number.\nMark Weintraub: Okay, super quarter. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.\nAdam Josephson: Mark, Bob and Tom, good morning and congrats on a really good quarter as well.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thanks.\nAdam Josephson: How would you - Tom, would you mind just elaborating on your demand expectations in the quarter just embedded in your guidance, you mentioned the comps get a lot more difficult in July. I know for the industry, the comps get particularly difficult in September. Can you just remind us roughly what your comps looked like last year and consequently what appropriate expectations might be as the quarter plays out?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, we had - Adam, we had some really, it really ramped up in the second half of the year as we've indicated. So those numbers were high-single even to mid double-digit increases by the time the fourth quarter rolled around. So to be at or above those numbers is a very, very large number and a robust number that we've essentially been able to maintain and if I look out into the second half of the year. And that's why I say these comps become much tougher, when you're starting to compare to a high-single and low double-digit numbers, pretty hard to be significantly higher than that given everything that's going on right now and just the difficulty getting it out the. door but interestingly enough, I'll also point out, our customer base is telling us that they could ship a lot more. They have higher demand than what they're able to get out because they're dealing with the same supply chain issues and transportation issues that we're dealing with. So I'm bullish because there is some upside even to these numbers that we have so far.\nAdam Josephson: Yes, no, I appreciate that and just relatedly, Tom, would you compare this period to anything else you can remember having worked at the company. And if so, what would that period be?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, I think a couple of things is number one is, I don't think we've ever gone through a time like this certainly in my career where the government has pumped a lot of money into the economy and businesses have just taken off coming out of a shutdown. I don't think anybody would have ever guessed that during a COVID shutdown, an extended COVID shutdown that people would turn to things like e-commerce very quickly and as rapidly as they did. Those habits are now pretty well entrenched and so what may have taken about five years to have occurred took place in a matter of a year. Those demands have certainly helped the corrugated box business, but again, interestingly enough, I mean I can look across we've got 15,000, 16,000 customers and our Top 50 accounts are up in excess of 15% and when you look at the mix of those companies across the board, I mean they are in every segment. Obviously, food and beverage is the largest one we have in the corrugated box business, but whether it's home improvement, apparel, like I said, food and beverage, whatever the case might be, they are up dramatically and most of our customers say they could even be higher.\nAdam Josephson: Yes, no, I really appreciate that, Tom. Mark, on your cash balance and just your balance sheet situation. Obviously, you've done a terrific job of maintaining a rock solid balance sheet for a long time and you have over $1.1 billion of cash and equivalents at your disposal. Can you just talk about what your inclination is in terms of repurchase, acquisitions? I know you've got the spending on the project, but you have ample room to do more. You've been more reluctant to buy back your stock in recent years and understandably so, but just can you update us on your thoughts about best uses of cash at this point or perhaps there may not be any just given where asset prices are?\nMark Kowlzan: The same thought process continues that we've always used. You can use cash for dividends, acquisitions, buybacks is an example. Organic opportunities with capital spending currently happens to be a very, very big return opportunity for us that we've been taking advantage of for the last few years. We're always looking at opportunities in terms of acquisition opportunities. So that hasn't changed, but I think more than anything we just remained very prudent in how we go about looking at that use of cash and being mindful that every dollar is extremely valuable and again quite frankly currently I would rather take a $1 of cash and put it into a good capital project in a box plant or a mill because we get immediate return for it, low-risk, high-return opportunity. Same thing with dividends, dividends being a Board level matter, we continue to discuss that periodically and understanding that dividends should be meaningful, but sustainable. And then as time goes on, we'll just continue to look at the bigger opportunities, but I think again one of our virtues that we've held closely is our patience and that we're an extremely patient group. So that's a long answer to your question.\nAdam Josephson: No, I appreciate it. And just one last one Mark, on the labor situation. I know freight is problematic for everyone these days and there are many other costs that are problematic. Can you talk about labor specifically what you've experienced there and what you're anticipating along those lines?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again it's pretty understandable that the demand for labor is high across the board. We've been fortunate through the capital spending programs in the last few years that with a lot of new technology going into box plants as an example, we've provided enormous tools for the existing workforce to become much more productive and so that has been a very big benefit to us. But again, we're struggling like everybody else is trying to again look at the workforce, how do you retain and how do you attract people when the demand is so high for the current labor pool in this country. So I think we're in a good place. Our retention rates continue to be high and so I'm feeling pretty good about it, but we're mindful. Tom, you want to add to that?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yeah, listen, labor is an issue for us, it's an issue for our customers as well. It's getting people back into the workforce is going to be incredibly important, but I think it also goes back to your capital question, Adam, relative to we think long-term about what we're going to be doing and how we run this business and one of the things that we've been working on for quite some time now is how to do more with less in terms of labor just because we knew that it was going to be - it's going to be an issue for us over the long haul. So I think that in itself has paid off some big dividends for us that Mark alluded to.\nAdam Josephson: Really appreciate it, Tom. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.\nGabe Hajde: Mark, Tom, Bob, good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nThomas Hassfurther: Good morning.\nGabe Hajde: I had a question, I mean not only did you reinstate guidance, but you also made mention of kind of just even second half strength on the packaging side. So I'm curious what you're seeing kind of different maybe than you were before. If there are end markets and I know Tom mentioned this in the call, e-commerce, but what gives you that confidence to make those comments relative again - relatively speaking I think you guys tend to be a little bit more conservative on the outlook.\nMark Kowlzan: Again, I think it's just inherently looking at the marketplace and understanding where demand has been now for the last year, understanding what the paper side of the business has been doing and where demand has been going with paper, looking at the pricing side of the equation and understanding how pricing has been holding up for our corrugated products side of the business, volume, pricing, and then just the success of our own execution and our capital spending. As we go forward, I think we're in a pretty good place now. If one assumes that demand does what we think it's going to do that in and of itself builds a lot of confidence opportunity for us.\nGabe Hajde: All right, thank you for that and I guess I know it may be difficult to discern, but is there any way you can parse out for us at Jackson for the incremental contributions that you're getting maybe in terms of production tons, the dollar amount and then is that being I guess reflected as a detriment to the paper business. Just trying to understand sort of a normalized profitability level might like in paper.\nMark Kowlzan: As far as Jackson, if you - without going into details which we won't, but if you think about the productivity and we've talked about this I believe on the April call for the second quarter Jackson No. 3 produced, I believe 111,000 tons of linerboard if I'm not mistaken. And we did explain that that is higher cost production than the rest of our system and so even at a higher cost at the productivity and efficiencies that that the machine is running at, it's extremely valuable in terms of its contribution to the bottom line and providing us the necessary tons. The cost will come down significantly next year as we go through the first phase of the conversion and then to the final phase the following year, you'll see the cost position at Jackson equal to or better than the rest of our containerboard system, but Jackson currently is a very significant contributor from the No. 3 machine containerboard side.\nGabe Hajde: Okay, but I guess to be clear, those inefficiencies are booked and kind of reported through packaging, not the paper segment?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes.\nGabe Hajde: Okay, thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Phil Ng with Jefferies.\nPhil Ng: Hey guys, congrats on another impressive quarter in a tough environment. I guess bigger picture, Mark and Tom, the industry is obviously set up for another strong year in box demand. I think many of us had been accustomed to seeing 1% growth and your comps to get a little tougher when we look at 2022. So do you expect the growth profile to kind of be elevated north of that 1% rate. Just any color how you think about the outlook going forward?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, Phil, if I could predict that exactly, I'd be a much wealthier man, I can tell you that. Yes, you're right, we've been more in that 1%, 1.5% growth range. We had this giant leap that took place last year. It's continued into this year. So I think just a maintenance of that number has changed the dynamics of this industry dramatically and I think going forward I think you'll see some more normalization, but I would guess it will be something a little north of where it traditionally has been just given the demand, we see out there in the marketplace and what we're hearing from our customers.\nThomas Hassfurther: I think one way I look at it, if you think about what happened in the 1980s and 1990s in North America in general, we had a lot of offshoring of manufacturing activity that created a decrease in corrugated product demand. At the same time, if you went back over the last 60 years for many decades up into that 1980s, 1990s period, box demand was strongly correlated to GDP. It wasn't a 1:1 correlation, but there was a high correlation. Through the 1980s into the 1990s, that correlation separated and again in the GDP equation, service industry became a bigger factor in GDP, manufacturing was less of a component. What we're seeing is more onshoring of manufacturing, more American businesses investing here in the United States in manufacturing, box demand tied to that factor and I have to believe that as we go forward into the next few decades as an example that you will see on a trend line basis, the box demand will have a new very strong correlation to GDP in general and that's how I'm going to think about the future.\nPhil Ng: Okay. Super helpful. I mean that's kind of how we're thinking about it too. So that's great to hear. Appreciating weather is having an impact on wood costs, how long do you think this impact is going to linger and any risk that you're going to have supply shortages that could impact your production in the back half of this year?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, there's a couple of factors involved, it's not - if it was just the wet weather, I'd say well sooner than later it's going to stop raining. We just had an unusually consistently wet winter and spring and then in the summer, we had that one tropical system that came through in June came up through the Southeast. But we've gone through wet periods before but what's also a major factor is the availability of the trucking side of the equation in terms of log hauling to a mill is dependent on trucks and so those truck drivers have a choice, they can go and work over the road hauling various goods or go into the woods and haul logs and so there has been extreme competition for truck drivers. So I would think though that if we get a dry period or a more normal weather period in the South, you'll see a significant normalization of wood cost relatively quickly and then everything else dependent on the economy in terms of labor, driver availability on that side of the equation. So it's a - there's two major factors in that equation.\nPhil Ng: Got it, but Mark, it doesn't sound like you're expecting any real shortages where you can't produce, I mean it's ongoing bottlenecks you've kind of experienced. Is that a fair remark?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, I mean, speaking for PCA, we're okay, day to day, we are looking at it carefully as you can imagine but currently barring any unforeseen hurricane, big tropical systems that come up through the Southern states right now, we're okay for the time being. I do watch the weather consistently because of that, but again it's something we can't control. So you do the best we can, but currently we're okay with where we are, we're just again - I'll point out the industry typically at this time of year would be starting their winter wood build and so mills across the Southern region would be starting to stockpile wood in their lay down yards, in their wet storage areas, satellite wet storage areas for the upcoming, what would traditionally be a wet late fall wet winter period. So you compound the problem right now that the inventories across the mill system in the South and Southeast have been depleted. We're running basically day to day short inventories. We're also not able to start our winter wood build as an industry as you can imagine. So it's going to be important that we do get a dry period because we have to set ourselves up for the late fall and winter when you really get the weather systems coming through with the traditional lows that come out of the Gulf of Mexico and move up through. So that's the longer-term concern.\nPhil Ng: Got it. And just one quick one. It looks like and I think Mark try to change this question earlier, but it looks like your drop through incremental margins on your volumes just really popped in 2Q. I know the previous two quarters maybe challenges with how strong demand into these bottlenecks, maybe the drop through wasn't as good, anything that sit out in the quarter and do you think that is sustainable in the back half of the year, those great incremental margins you saw in the quarter?\nMark Kowlzan: Again, if you think about the richness of the book of business in general that we have, the operating efficiencies - we executed extremely well in the mills and the box plants. These capital projects and I called it out just in 2018, '19, '20 and then the half of 2021, we spent $852 million on significant improvements in two-thirds of our box plant fleet across the country and massive capital opportunity for the employees to be significantly more productive and that's paid off in a big way for us. And so again, it's pretty simple, great book of business and operate extremely efficiently equals high margins.\nPhil Ng: That's super helpful. Thank you. Really appreciate it guys.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.\nNeel Kumar: Thank you. For corrugated, can you just talk about the cadence of the 9.6% volume growth through second quarter by month. And then can you also just touch on what you're seeing in terms of demand trends for your various end markets, maybe what surprised both positively and negatively during the quarter?\nThomas Hassfurther: I can give you the volume trends through the quarter. April was up 12%, May was up 11% and June was up 6% and as I indicated July, we're rolling about 7% over last year. Again, I'll remind you that it's not as if volume went down. Volume continues to improve but it's against a much tougher comp.\nNeel Kumar: Right and then can you just maybe touch on end markets, how they performed relative to expectations?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, our end markets have performed as expected. I mean just as I think I indicated earlier that our top accounts are up in double-digits and have plenty of opportunities to continue to grow. They are hindered a little bit by those same things we talked about which supply chain issues, freight issues, labor issues, those sorts of things. So I think that the trend remains very good.\nNeel Kumar: Okay and then in Paper, can you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of demand trends so far in July. I mean what's your expectations are for back-to-school demand this year?\nMark Kowlzan: I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.\nNeel Kumar: Yes, I'm just saying for paper, can you just talk about your demand trends so far in July and your expectations for back-to-school demand?\nMark Kowlzan: Paper as you could imagine, the trend line has moved up and it's for that very reason the school openings, business openings that are starting to - people got to restock, but we explained that because of the Jackson machine coming out of the system, we've reached a new equilibrium in our ability to go to market and to serve the market. So we've intentionally brought that marketplace to a new point with PCA. So we're up, but we're up to a new level that we can manage to and supply into. So we're not representative of the industry at large because of what we've done at Jackson.\nNeel Kumar: Great, thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You already discussed wood fiber costs for 3Q quite a bit, but curious what your expectation is for recovered fiber costs and what's embedded in the guidance going forward. I understand the sign is impactful to you as other peers but just any thoughts there would be helpful?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, your guess is as good as mine. We're fortunate that - again we've, you have to believe with the current trends it's going up and there is nothing that indicates it's going to go down any time soon. Some of the latest data that's come out indicates record low nationwide inventory levels of recycled fiber availability, all time demand for all recycled fibers across the board. And so unless something happens to the marketplace in the world, I don't see that changing, but again, I think for PCA, we've always considered ourselves - we don't have a crystal ball, we don't know where the world's going, so we build ourselves around flexibility and we still remained the lowest dependent on OCC as an example compared to the rest of the industry. We can take advantage of it, but again we're always mindful of maintaining our flexibility and fiber utilization.\nKyle White: Got it. And then going back to Neel's question on some of the end markets, what are you seeing in agriculture. Do you have any exposure to or any impacts from the fires over in the Pacific? And then on e-commerce, are you seeing any kind of signs of any slowdowns as markets reopen and people aren't as home as much?\nThomas Hassfurther: Kyle, this is Tom. Regarding Ag, we have not had any impact on our Ag end markets so far. The majority of the large fire out west are on the Oregon-California border. So, those Northern California Ag markets, those fires are quite a bit north of them. Regarding e-com, we have seen zero slowdown down in e-com. In fact, I think everybody in the business of any sort is trying to figure out how they can use that e-com to better grow their business and consumer preference still remains very strong in the e-com area.\nKyle White: Got it. Thank you. Good luck in the balance of the year.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator:  Your next question is from Cleve Rueckert with UBS.\nCleve Rueckert: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nCleve Rueckert: I just had one follow-up on containerboard production, with the mills coming off maintenance in Q3 and your outlook on demand, how much do you think containerboard production could grow sequentially in the quarter and when do you think you'll be in a position to have inventories more normalized in line with your target?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, we're in a much better place than we were earlier in the second quarter because of all the outages we're dealing with, but as we mentioned on the call on a weeks of supply basis in terms of weeks of supply inventory, we're at an extremely low level compared to what our needs are. So even though we built some inventory, we're not where we need to be or should be. Our productivity out of our corrugated - I mean our containerboard mill system will be much better in the third quarter. Production will be up. I'm not going to give you the number. If you can run the math on what you currently have for mills in the system, but we expect to build in terms of our productivity, but also, we also expect third quarter to be a very high demand quarter for that containerboard through our box plant system. So it's probably not the answer you wanted, but I'm not going to give you exact quantitative numbers.\nCleve Rueckert: You have latent capacity in the box plant system, I mean could you run the box plants harder if you needed to?\nMark Kowlzan: I wish and I talk about that all the time. We'd be in big trouble if we had not undertaken a few years back the capital program that we did and also the organizational changes that took place back in 2019 with the technology and engineering groups and how we manage the business day to day, but yes, I wish we had a lot more productivity opportunities in the box plants, but we're building that in every day with the execution of more capital spending and projects that we're doing. So we're in a good place, but it's like we've always talked about it in our mills also and I see this in the box plants. Box plants and mills run really well when they are under pressure and I'll continue to believe that going forward and we have plans, longer-term strategic plans on how we will continue to build out our opportunities and anticipate what our customer requirements will be because it's all about the customer and understanding what the needs are and being able to react and respond in any part of the country and within a region to meet that market demand.\nCleve Rueckert: That's fair enough. And one quick follow-up, you did mention earlier in the prepared remarks, that you're outgrowing the industry through the first half in Packaging, which obviously is implying market share gain. Do you have a sense of where you're gaining share whether either in markets or in product types? And that's it from me. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: That's a very complex question and where do we gain share? I think we have a long tradition of having a much broader customer base than most of our major competitors. We have corrugated plants plus sheet plant network that we deal with. We have tried to align with customers that have a very good growth trend and good opportunities and of course, we've got a customer base spread over 16,000 customers all trying to win in their marketplaces. So I think those are the - and of course, I think our ability to be able to, as we've talked about over and over here relative to capital, our ability to expand as our customers' needs and as they grow. So those are the key elements to why we have traditionally gotten more market share than our competitors.\nCleve Rueckert: Thanks very much.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Stephanie. I would like to thank everybody for taking the time today to be with us on the call and I look forward to talking with you on October for the third quarter earnings call. Stay well, stay safe, have a nice day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As Mark indicated, containerboard and corrugated products demand remains very strong across most of all of our end markets. Our plants achieved a new all-time quarterly record for total box shipments as well as a second quarter record for shipments per day, both of which were up 9.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Through the first half of 2021, our box shipment volume is up 9% on a per day basis versus the industry being up 6.8%. Driven by higher domestic demand, outside sales volume of containerboard was about 43,000 tons above the second quarter of 2020, but was down slightly versus the first quarter of this year due to lower export shipments. Supplying the record requirements of our box plants and the need to position inventory levels ahead of what appears to be a strong second half of the year. We are getting good realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.92 per share above the second quarter of 2020 and up $0.51 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.09 per share versus last year's second quarter and up $0.04 compared to the first quarter of 2021. George, its Tom. I can tell you that going into the third quarter, our bookings and billings are running about 7% ahead of last year. Keep in mind that our comps become much tougher. So it's not as if volume has slowed down at all. It's remained incredibly robust coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and all the way through this year. I think that's why we felt quite a bit more comfortable about giving some sort of guidance going forward. Also, you asked about the some of the lack of supply in the second quarter maybe bleeding over into the third quarter. We're running lead times that are longer than we're used to and certainly longer than our customers are used to. So the demand remains very high. Trying to get it out the door is an issue more related to transportation at this stage than it is certainly about paper. We're able to take care of our own plants through our system. So that's not the issue for us, it's more transportation and I think that's reflective of most of the industry. Good morning, Mark. Mark, this is Tom. Let me just comment, we say very little about our price increase, but this isn't any different than the price increases we've had in the past. It's a very disciplined approach that we do. We roll them in over approximately the 90-day period. We have local accounts to go in at a maybe a quicker rate than some of our contractual accounts. If you want to look at the three price increases kind of separately, the first price increase was effectively done, and but you do have some bleed over depending on contracts and things like that, timing, those can be impacted. Second price increase, the same way, it rolls out over a whole 90-day period. Third price increase hasn't been reflected yet in pulp and paper. So obviously, we have raised prices to our independent customers and our linerboard and medium customers domestically. Those are in place, but the lion's share of the price increase, which goes through boxes, again, that will flow through over a 90-day period. So virtually, none of that would be reflected at this stage in the third quarter. Thanks. Yes, we had - Adam, we had some really, it really ramped up in the second half of the year as we've indicated. So those numbers were high-single even to mid double-digit increases by the time the fourth quarter rolled around. So to be at or above those numbers is a very, very large number and a robust number that we've essentially been able to maintain and if I look out into the second half of the year. And that's why I say these comps become much tougher, when you're starting to compare to a high-single and low double-digit numbers, pretty hard to be significantly higher than that given everything that's going on right now and just the difficulty getting it out the. door but interestingly enough, I'll also point out, our customer base is telling us that they could ship a lot more. They have higher demand than what they're able to get out because they're dealing with the same supply chain issues and transportation issues that we're dealing with. So I'm bullish because there is some upside even to these numbers that we have so far. Well, I think a couple of things is number one is, I don't think we've ever gone through a time like this certainly in my career where the government has pumped a lot of money into the economy and businesses have just taken off coming out of a shutdown. I don't think anybody would have ever guessed that during a COVID shutdown, an extended COVID shutdown that people would turn to things like e-commerce very quickly and as rapidly as they did. Those habits are now pretty well entrenched and so what may have taken about five years to have occurred took place in a matter of a year. Those demands have certainly helped the corrugated box business, but again, interestingly enough, I mean I can look across we've got 15,000, 16,000 customers and our Top 50 accounts are up in excess of 15% and when you look at the mix of those companies across the board, I mean they are in every segment. Obviously, food and beverage is the largest one we have in the corrugated box business, but whether it's home improvement, apparel, like I said, food and beverage, whatever the case might be, they are up dramatically and most of our customers say they could even be higher. Yeah, listen, labor is an issue for us, it's an issue for our customers as well. It's getting people back into the workforce is going to be incredibly important, but I think it also goes back to your capital question, Adam, relative to we think long-term about what we're going to be doing and how we run this business and one of the things that we've been working on for quite some time now is how to do more with less in terms of labor just because we knew that it was going to be - it's going to be an issue for us over the long haul. So I think that in itself has paid off some big dividends for us that Mark alluded to. Good morning. I think one way I look at it, if you think about what happened in the 1980s and 1990s in North America in general, we had a lot of offshoring of manufacturing activity that created a decrease in corrugated product demand. At the same time, if you went back over the last 60 years for many decades up into that 1980s, 1990s period, box demand was strongly correlated to GDP. It wasn't a 1:1 correlation, but there was a high correlation. Through the 1980s into the 1990s, that correlation separated and again in the GDP equation, service industry became a bigger factor in GDP, manufacturing was less of a component. What we're seeing is more onshoring of manufacturing, more American businesses investing here in the United States in manufacturing, box demand tied to that factor and I have to believe that as we go forward into the next few decades as an example that you will see on a trend line basis, the box demand will have a new very strong correlation to GDP in general and that's how I'm going to think about the future. I can give you the volume trends through the quarter. April was up 12%, May was up 11% and June was up 6% and as I indicated July, we're rolling about 7% over last year. Again, I'll remind you that it's not as if volume went down. Volume continues to improve but it's against a much tougher comp. Kyle, this is Tom. Regarding Ag, we have not had any impact on our Ag end markets so far. The majority of the large fire out west are on the Oregon-California border. So, those Northern California Ag markets, those fires are quite a bit north of them. Regarding e-com, we have seen zero slowdown down in e-com. In fact, I think everybody in the business of any sort is trying to figure out how they can use that e-com to better grow their business and consumer preference still remains very strong in the e-com area."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up and then would be glad to take questions. Thank you, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter was $12 million with sales of $142 million or an 8% margin compared to second quarter 2020 EBITDA of $5 million and sales of $123 million or a 4% margin. Although about 1% below second quarter 2020 levels, prices and mix moved higher for the first and into the second quarter of 2021 as we continued to implement our announced price increases. Volume was 17% above last year when pandemic issues caused us to take both machines at the Jackson, Alabama mill down for two months during the second quarter. While this year, we ran the No. 1 machine at Jackson on paper and the No. 3 machine ran linerboard. Now that we have our finished goods inventory at a new optimal level, sales volume in the second quarter is fairly reflective of what our production capability is as a three machine paper system. We'll continue to assess our outlook for paper demand and will run our paper system accordingly. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. As we move from the second to the third quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand for containerboard and corrugated products with one additional day for box shipments. Paper segment volume should be relatively flat primarily due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the Jackson Mill. We will also continue to implement our previously announced price increases in both our Packaging and Paper segments. George, I'll take the wood cost. Obviously, we've had a very wet period of time throughout the entire Gulf Coastal region up to the southeastern states through the entire winter and spring into the summer months now. And so coupled with the high demand for pulpwood and the logistics issues with the trucking side of the equation, it's basically put the situation where it is that pulp prices are up dramatically because of those situations, but again, it's more of a weather related phenomenon than anything else. Bob, why don't you go ahead and talk about the average cost? Okay, next question please. Good morning, Mark. Yes, we've talked about this before and as you could imagine, that's a Board level matter, but we have got the depths and the breadth of the talent across the board. That's been identified and we continue to develop. We're very confident in the talent pool we have and the Board feels the same way that. Again, we've got enormous opportunities with the talent across the entire company. Yes, as you can imagine, without the Jackson No. 3 machine, we've gone ahead and exited some business over the last six months and now as you think about that as a three machine system, we're going to be supplying a smaller marketplace. So we've been able to rationalize that accordingly, but that has shifted us down to a few bigger customers, but nevertheless, the entire market for us has shifted down over the last eight years, since we've run the paper business. And so we're very confident that we'll continue to supply into that market and do it in a meaningful manner as we go forward and so - Go ahead Mark. Well, we've said this for the better part of the last decade that you can convert anything to do anything, but there is a capital cost and there are puts and takes with transportation, logistics and then what is your intent in terms of product mix. Right now, we have a good market for the paper that's coming out of I Falls. We'll continue to run to that opportunity. We have the Jackson conversion coming on big next year that will continue to supply us with the necessary containerboard for the next few years. And I would say this, as long as the Paper business offers us an opportunity with the International Falls mill, we'll continue to take advantage of that opportunity. In the future years, if that was not the case, then we'd have to reassess the situation and look at our optionality with that asset, but trust me, it's - you have to believe that we've already done that and we have the opportunities in the files and know what we would do at any given time. So we're pretty confident that we've got a lot of flexibility. Next question, please. Neither Jackson will continue to run with the No. 3 machine on containerboard and at the present time, our intent is to run No. 1 machine on a paper. Yes, we're extremely pleased with the rate that we've been able to execute these projects and I'll give you an example, I mean, we did slow down a little bit last year during the 2020 period and we have become a little more targeted in what projects required the attention of the various technical organization just because of the travel restrictions and the concern for people's well-being, but this year that was ramped up to full activity and so we're continuing to execute well across the board. But I can give you an example, if you go back over the last 3.5 years, we've executed approximately at 62 of these box plants $850 million worth of capital project activity. Flexo Folder-Gluers converting equipment upgrades, major rebuilds, new corrugators, built the two new plants and so we're doing this all in-house, but the pace is ramped up in 2021 over some of 2020. So we're very pleased with what we're seeing. And so we currently have a great deal of activity going on at numerous plants nationwide that will continue to provide the benefits that I spoke about and that Tom spoke about. So, we're extremely pleased with the opportunities. Next question, please. Yes, Mark, yes, I mean, for starters, if you just look at the raw volume, I mean the raw volume is up dramatically and as we came out of COVID last year into that fourth quarter, the question mark and it was a big question mark for everybody was will that level of volume be maintained going into 2021 and then throughout 2021. So far, we've maintained very close to those kind of numbers and I think it's just indicative of what the market is right now and the changes that have taken place from consumer habits. Also, I'll remind you that last year during COVID of course you know from a mix standpoint, our display business had basically gone to nothing because of the shutdowns and no shopping in brick and mortar and things like that sort. So that end of the business had dried up quite a bit and that's back now and then also, we've had good cost controls in terms of getting this volume out. As we've indicated, a lot of these capital projects are paying off. So we can - we're very comfortable with the number. Okay, next question please. Thank you. The same thought process continues that we've always used. You can use cash for dividends, acquisitions, buybacks is an example. Organic opportunities with capital spending currently happens to be a very, very big return opportunity for us that we've been taking advantage of for the last few years. We're always looking at opportunities in terms of acquisition opportunities. So that hasn't changed, but I think more than anything we just remained very prudent in how we go about looking at that use of cash and being mindful that every dollar is extremely valuable and again quite frankly currently I would rather take a $1 of cash and put it into a good capital project in a box plant or a mill because we get immediate return for it, low-risk, high-return opportunity. Same thing with dividends, dividends being a Board level matter, we continue to discuss that periodically and understanding that dividends should be meaningful, but sustainable. And then as time goes on, we'll just continue to look at the bigger opportunities, but I think again one of our virtues that we've held closely is our patience and that we're an extremely patient group. So that's a long answer to your question. Well, again it's pretty understandable that the demand for labor is high across the board. We've been fortunate through the capital spending programs in the last few years that with a lot of new technology going into box plants as an example, we've provided enormous tools for the existing workforce to become much more productive and so that has been a very big benefit to us. But again, we're struggling like everybody else is trying to again look at the workforce, how do you retain and how do you attract people when the demand is so high for the current labor pool in this country. So I think we're in a good place. Our retention rates continue to be high and so I'm feeling pretty good about it, but we're mindful. Tom, you want to add to that? Okay, next question please. Good morning. Again, I think it's just inherently looking at the marketplace and understanding where demand has been now for the last year, understanding what the paper side of the business has been doing and where demand has been going with paper, looking at the pricing side of the equation and understanding how pricing has been holding up for our corrugated products side of the business, volume, pricing, and then just the success of our own execution and our capital spending. As we go forward, I think we're in a pretty good place now. If one assumes that demand does what we think it's going to do that in and of itself builds a lot of confidence opportunity for us. As far as Jackson, if you - without going into details which we won't, but if you think about the productivity and we've talked about this I believe on the April call for the second quarter Jackson No. 3 produced, I believe 111,000 tons of linerboard if I'm not mistaken. And we did explain that that is higher cost production than the rest of our system and so even at a higher cost at the productivity and efficiencies that that the machine is running at, it's extremely valuable in terms of its contribution to the bottom line and providing us the necessary tons. The cost will come down significantly next year as we go through the first phase of the conversion and then to the final phase the following year, you'll see the cost position at Jackson equal to or better than the rest of our containerboard system, but Jackson currently is a very significant contributor from the No. 3 machine containerboard side. Yes. Next question please. Well, Phil, if I could predict that exactly, I'd be a much wealthier man, I can tell you that. Yes, you're right, we've been more in that 1%, 1.5% growth range. We had this giant leap that took place last year. It's continued into this year. So I think just a maintenance of that number has changed the dynamics of this industry dramatically and I think going forward I think you'll see some more normalization, but I would guess it will be something a little north of where it traditionally has been just given the demand, we see out there in the marketplace and what we're hearing from our customers. Well, there's a couple of factors involved, it's not - if it was just the wet weather, I'd say well sooner than later it's going to stop raining. We just had an unusually consistently wet winter and spring and then in the summer, we had that one tropical system that came through in June came up through the Southeast. But we've gone through wet periods before but what's also a major factor is the availability of the trucking side of the equation in terms of log hauling to a mill is dependent on trucks and so those truck drivers have a choice, they can go and work over the road hauling various goods or go into the woods and haul logs and so there has been extreme competition for truck drivers. So I would think though that if we get a dry period or a more normal weather period in the South, you'll see a significant normalization of wood cost relatively quickly and then everything else dependent on the economy in terms of labor, driver availability on that side of the equation. So it's a - there's two major factors in that equation. Well, I mean, speaking for PCA, we're okay, day to day, we are looking at it carefully as you can imagine but currently barring any unforeseen hurricane, big tropical systems that come up through the Southern states right now, we're okay for the time being. I do watch the weather consistently because of that, but again it's something we can't control. So you do the best we can, but currently we're okay with where we are, we're just again - I'll point out the industry typically at this time of year would be starting their winter wood build and so mills across the Southern region would be starting to stockpile wood in their lay down yards, in their wet storage areas, satellite wet storage areas for the upcoming, what would traditionally be a wet late fall wet winter period. So you compound the problem right now that the inventories across the mill system in the South and Southeast have been depleted. We're running basically day to day short inventories. We're also not able to start our winter wood build as an industry as you can imagine. So it's going to be important that we do get a dry period because we have to set ourselves up for the late fall and winter when you really get the weather systems coming through with the traditional lows that come out of the Gulf of Mexico and move up through. So that's the longer-term concern. Again, if you think about the richness of the book of business in general that we have, the operating efficiencies - we executed extremely well in the mills and the box plants. These capital projects and I called it out just in 2018, '19, '20 and then the half of 2021, we spent $852 million on significant improvements in two-thirds of our box plant fleet across the country and massive capital opportunity for the employees to be significantly more productive and that's paid off in a big way for us. And so again, it's pretty simple, great book of business and operate extremely efficiently equals high margins. Okay, next question please. Well, our end markets have performed as expected. I mean just as I think I indicated earlier that our top accounts are up in double-digits and have plenty of opportunities to continue to grow. They are hindered a little bit by those same things we talked about which supply chain issues, freight issues, labor issues, those sorts of things. So I think that the trend remains very good. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you. Paper as you could imagine, the trend line has moved up and it's for that very reason the school openings, business openings that are starting to - people got to restock, but we explained that because of the Jackson machine coming out of the system, we've reached a new equilibrium in our ability to go to market and to serve the market. So we've intentionally brought that marketplace to a new point with PCA. So we're up, but we're up to a new level that we can manage to and supply into. So we're not representative of the industry at large because of what we've done at Jackson. Okay, next question please. Well, again, your guess is as good as mine. We're fortunate that - again we've, you have to believe with the current trends it's going up and there is nothing that indicates it's going to go down any time soon. Some of the latest data that's come out indicates record low nationwide inventory levels of recycled fiber availability, all time demand for all recycled fibers across the board. And so unless something happens to the marketplace in the world, I don't see that changing, but again, I think for PCA, we've always considered ourselves - we don't have a crystal ball, we don't know where the world's going, so we build ourselves around flexibility and we still remained the lowest dependent on OCC as an example compared to the rest of the industry. We can take advantage of it, but again we're always mindful of maintaining our flexibility and fiber utilization. Thank you. Next question please. Good morning. Well, again, we're in a much better place than we were earlier in the second quarter because of all the outages we're dealing with, but as we mentioned on the call on a weeks of supply basis in terms of weeks of supply inventory, we're at an extremely low level compared to what our needs are. So even though we built some inventory, we're not where we need to be or should be. Our productivity out of our corrugated - I mean our containerboard mill system will be much better in the third quarter. Production will be up. I'm not going to give you the number. If you can run the math on what you currently have for mills in the system, but we expect to build in terms of our productivity, but also, we also expect third quarter to be a very high demand quarter for that containerboard through our box plant system. So it's probably not the answer you wanted, but I'm not going to give you exact quantitative numbers. I wish and I talk about that all the time. We'd be in big trouble if we had not undertaken a few years back the capital program that we did and also the organizational changes that took place back in 2019 with the technology and engineering groups and how we manage the business day to day, but yes, I wish we had a lot more productivity opportunities in the box plants, but we're building that in every day with the execution of more capital spending and projects that we're doing. So we're in a good place, but it's like we've always talked about it in our mills also and I see this in the box plants. Box plants and mills run really well when they are under pressure and I'll continue to believe that going forward and we have plans, longer-term strategic plans on how we will continue to build out our opportunities and anticipate what our customer requirements will be because it's all about the customer and understanding what the needs are and being able to react and respond in any part of the country and within a region to meet that market demand. That's a very complex question and where do we gain share? I think we have a long tradition of having a much broader customer base than most of our major competitors. We have corrugated plants plus sheet plant network that we deal with. We have tried to align with customers that have a very good growth trend and good opportunities and of course, we've got a customer base spread over 16,000 customers all trying to win in their marketplaces. So I think those are the - and of course, I think our ability to be able to, as we've talked about over and over here relative to capital, our ability to expand as our customers' needs and as they grow. So those are the key elements to why we have traditionally gotten more market share than our competitors. Thank you. Next question please. Thank you, Stephanie. I would like to thank everybody for taking the time today to be with us on the call and I look forward to talking with you on October for the third quarter earnings call.

As Mark mentioned, corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. Total volume in our corrugated products plants was up 6.6% versus last year and equaled the all-time record for total box shipments that we just set in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shipments per day were up 8.3% over last year, which set a new first quarter record for us. Strong domestic demand drove outside sales volume of containerboard 13% above last year's first quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.26 per share above the first quarter of 2020 and up $0.52 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continued to implement our November 2020 announced price increases during the quarter and we began the implementation of our announced March increase. Export containerboard prices were up $0.05 per share versus last year's first quarter and up $0.04 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter was $16 million with sales of $165 million or a 10% margin compared to the first quarter of 2020\u2019s EBITDA of $42 million and sales of $217 million or 19% margin. As expected sales volume was about 22% below last year, as we ran only one machine at the Jackson, Alabama mill this quarter versus both machines running in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter paper prices and mix were almost 3% below last year. However, prices began to move higher in the latter part of the quarter, resulting from the announced paper price increases and averaged 1% higher than fourth quarter 2020 average prices.\nBob Mundy: Thanks Mark. For the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $192 million and free cash flow of $107 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $85 million and common stock dividends of $95 million. We ended the quarter with $983 million of cash on hand or $1.1 billion including marketable securities. Our liquidity at March 31 was $1.5 billion. I want to update you on our full year guidance for a couple of items that we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and scope of work for the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills has changed and the new total company estimated cost impact for the year is $0.97 per share. The actual impact in the first quarter $0.10 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.30 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter. Also our capital spending estimate for the year has changed to a range of $650 million to $675 million as we have now announced our plans for the conversion of the number three paper machine at our Jackson mill to linerboard. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks Bob. Regarding the conversion of the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama our current plans are to continue running the machine on linerboard as demand warrants. In a manner similar as to how we ran in the first quarter until the scheduled first phase outage is taken in the second quarter of 2022. The converted machine is expected to operate at an initial production rate of approximately 75% of its new capacity. The second phase outage work is planned for mid-2023 with the machine reaching its run rate capacity of 2,000 tons per day by the end of 2023. This phased conversion over the next few years will provide much needed internal linerboard supply. This gives us a runway for maintaining an optimal integration level and enables us to further optimize and enhance our current mill capacity in box plant operations. We're committed to being fully integrated and we have a track record of ramping up production from machine conversions according to our customers demand requirements.\nOperator:  Your first question will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the progress guys. I guess the first question that I had given that you're running really tight, at least in terms of your prepared remarks, in terms of managing your customer requests, the freight logistics issues domestically that we're seeing, I realize you have customers internationally and their long-term relationships, but why the increase in export sales in the quarter? Why not try to keep some of those tons domestically, if in fact that's where you need them? And then I have a couple of follow-ons.\nTom Hassfurther: Hey, George, this is Tom. I'll just answer that real quickly.\nGeorge Staphos: Good morning, Tom.\nTom Hassfurther: We had a number of export commitments that had to take place \u2013 that were running over from the previous year that we had to take care of in the first quarter to maintain our relationships, and so we just had to get that taken care of. And we knew full well that we'd also be able to supply our box plants, although with a very tight inventory.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. I appreciate that. Second question I had, if you can just give us the normal rundown, Tom, perhaps that you would give us on bookings and billings early in the quarter. And are you seeing any signs at all of customers trying to conserve on corrugated given the market that you've seen? Or if anything given the growth that we've been saying, are you seeing new applications beyond e-commerce for corrugated? So kind of a couple part question there.\nTom Hassfurther: Good question, George. First of all, through 14 days, our bookings are up 16% versus a year ago. So obviously the volume remains very robust and we're obviously very pleased with those kinds of numbers and the trend that has just continued coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and continued into this year. There's no way customers can, in essence, hoard or order ahead or anything like that with the demand we're having right now. And a lot of our customers report business conditions as good as what we're talking about. And they're just trying to keep their head above water. And we obviously are keeping them supplied with boxes.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. I was really more getting at the point, if customers are trying to conserve, it sounds like right now they're just living hand to mouth and they'll worry about that or for that matter, the growth that look once they can kind of catch up. My last question, I know it's something you might not want to talk too much live mic on, but qualitatively, if we look at where our first quartile and a fourth quartile machine might be in containerboard, would it be unduly penalizing to estimate that maybe right now Jackson is costing you, I don't know, $10 million a quarter just because of where it is on the cost curve right now, relative to where it will be at some point? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. I think everyone could understand that without the capital investment. We are running probably in that high third, low fourth quartile costs portion of a curve. The beauty of it is though, it's very productive, very efficient and providing us the critical tons we need to run the box system. We've also in the last four months, we've taken considerable cost out as we've learned more about the machine, but the machine has proven to be quite an extremely efficient machine, but someone might think about the capital spending that we are undertaking as we speak that we'll go through next year and the year after.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you very much, Mark. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.\nMark Wilde: Thanks. Good morning, Mark, and congratulations on a very good quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Mark. Thanks.\nMark Wilde: Mark, I wanted to \u2013 the mill volume was just incredible here in the first quarter. You did about 1.2 million tons and your listed capacity in the K is 4.3 million a year. So factoring in Jackson, I wonder if you can just help reconcile that. And is this a pace that's all sustainable over time?\nMark Kowlzan: No one asked us in January what we really produced in Jackson in the fourth quarter. But if you think about what we are producing and what we produced in the fourth quarter and what we produced in the first quarter, the Jackson No. 3 machine on a run rate and looking at its grade mix, it\u2019s producing a little over 100,000 tons a quarter. It's in that range. And so on an annualized basis, it's providing an incremental 400,000-plus tons a year to the run rate. And part of the reason, again, if you think about the filings, we did not have the machine listed as a true linerboard machine. So we still consider it a paper machine providing us with so much needed linerboard right now. Fast forward, to help you with your math; if you assume the 4.3 million plus the 400,000 tons, you get pretty close to your number. The other factor that we\u2019ll give you a little understanding on is the project I mentioned on the call just a few minutes ago, the Wallula OCC project. Not only was that going to be a fiber flexibility opportunity for the Wallula mill, but anybody that understands fiber physics, recycled fibers of any kind drain and dry much more easily than virgin fiber. And so by mixing now the OCC and with our virgin kraft fiber at the Wallula mill, we're seeing as we expected much higher speeds on the machines, and in particular, the No. 3 machine, the drainage pressing drawing is far superior than it was before. And so starting in February, when we started the OCC plant up, we've been averaging close to 100 tons a day more production on that machine. And so that's another piece of the incremental first quarter tons that was built in, and that you'll see for the rest of the year also. So that \u2013 go ahead.\nMark Wilde: Yes, that\u2019s good. I was just going to say, I think when you first converted Wallula, you were talking about 400,000 tons there, but the potential to get it to 500,000 or 550,000, where would that machine be right now taking into account the OCC mix?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, the whole mill, because don't forget the No. 2 machine is sitting there making medium. We had talked all along that that mill had the opportunity to get close to that 600,000 ton annualized run rate for both machines and where they're essentially right now.\nMark Wilde: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And just secondly, Mark is there any way to help us think about the impact of this adverse weather in the first quarter? I would have expected that that would have caused issues perhaps down in DeRidder and maybe kind of across your converting business.\nMark Kowlzan: Let me \u2013 I'm going to say a few things, and then Tom and Bob can add to that. We were very fortunate that we were not as severely impacted as some competitors. The DeRidder mill was able to run through this. We had transportation, logistics problems trying to move raw materials in and finished goods out. We had the bigger impact in the Texas region, in the Dallas metroplex area with our box plants. We had some of the box plants, obviously down. Tom, do you want to add a little color to the two-week period when we had a lot of the severe weather?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. Mark, we obviously lost a significant production time in those box plants. We made up for a lot of that in the subsequent month, but it was a very, very difficult month. The ag crop, obviously, down in down the Rio Grande Valley was dramatically impacted, which also impacted our volumes in that area. In addition, as you may be aware, the impact of the chemical plants to provide the chemicals that make up our glues and adhesives was definitely impacted, and we've been suffering shortages of that product across all the companies. And we've had to take some extraordinary measures to make sure that we can continue to run at much higher expense to do so.\nMark Wilde: Okay. All right. That's really helpful. I'll turn it over guys. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Mark. Hello?\nOperator: Mark, you may be on mute. Okay. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. I believe you said that the impact from pricing in your domestic business was $0.52 from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, was that right? Did I hear that right?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, Mark.\nMark Weintraub: So if I translate that into kind of millions of dollars, it sounds like, like $60 million plus, which if you're making 1.2 million tons of containerboard on an integrated basis seems like $50 per ton. So is that \u2013 and if that's the case, have you already gotten the lion's share of that November increase, or is part of that mix, and there's still a decent amount to come?\nTom Hassfurther: Hey, Mark, this is Tom. We have gotten most of the increase from November in the first quarter. We do have some of that trails into the second quarter and even into the beginning of the third quarter, just based on contracts. But the lion's share has been accomplished in the first quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on a really great quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Adam. Thanks.\nAdam Josephson: Good morning, Mark. A couple of questions. On guidance, obviously, pre-pandemic, you gave quarterly guidance. You haven't resumed doing so since, even though you put up really good numbers of this quarter and the outlook seems pretty good. Has your philosophy changed about providing quarterly guidance? And \u2013 or if not, when do you intend to resume giving guidance?\nMark Kowlzan: I think the way we would answer that is that there's still so much uncertainty in the world around us. If you think about the number that Tom just gave you for the volume, if a year ago somebody told you that volume was going to be up 16% year-over-year and on a given month, no one would believe you. And so until the pandemic winds down and we come back to some at least sense of what we think the new world normality will be, we believe it's in our best interests, in the shareholder's best interest to not give guidance.\nAdam Josephson: Yes, I completely understand. You stole my thunder. I was going to ask you, I mean, I think in 2019 your per day shipments were up about 1%. In the first quarter, they were up 8.3% and you're talking about bookings up 16%. So is there any way for you to separate the impact of the pandemic and all this stimulus, and talk about what you think normalized demand even is? Or is it just impossible to do?\nTom Hassfurther: Hey, Adam, this is Tom.\nAdam Josephson: Hey, Tom.\nTom Hassfurther: It's virtually impossible to do. Let me tell you, because our customer base across the board with the exception of a few are up dramatically. And so it's not just e-commerce as an example, being the only segment that's really driving this, it's a lot of segments that are going on. And I think obviously the stimulus helps and has been a plus for us. But again, as Mark said, we've got to wait until things settle down to really be able to get our arms around what's really going on in the world.\nAdam Josephson: And Tom, why \u2013 any explanation for April? I mean, it's just \u2013 it's so outsized, it's just mind-blowing. Is there any logical explanation that you can come up with?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think what we're seeing is we're seeing the exact same thing that we saw starting in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter was up dramatically. It rolled right into the first quarter, and now it's rolling right into the second quarter. So to try to predict it would have been difficult to do and we expected just like a lot of other people expected that the fourth quarter, that things might slow down a little bit from the fourth quarter, but they just haven't. So it remains incredibly robust and I think we've got a lot of customers that are way behind on their shipments as well. So I think it will continue going forward for awhile.\nAdam Josephson: Yes, thanks. I mean, Mark, one on uncoated freesheet. So just as part of your decision to convert No. 3, how are you thinking about demand trends and that business this year and longer term? Do you expect any rebound this year or thereafter? And relatedly, how did that affect your conversations with your large customers communicating this decision on your part? And did they express any concerns about supply as a consequence?\nMark Kowlzan: Regarding the first part of the question, until again, if you think about the biggest demand for cut size paper would be office activity in schools, business activity. Until, again, at such time as businesses resume more of a normal pattern of in-office activity, you won't see cup size demand pickup dramatically. As schools come back and go back to a more normalized, school day function, more cut size use will take place in schools. So I would expect starting in the fall semester for the new school year that more demand will take place. I can't quantify that for you. I would just say that it should move up positively. We do think ultimately there the pandemic has created a new opportunity for people that they'll work from home, they'll work part days. I mean, people that are in the business world are obviously trying to understand how we will all run our businesses in the future, and whether we'll have people in the office full-time, part-time, flex-time. And so paper demand will go along with that. We are anticipating that there will be some permanent demand destruction that comes out of the pandemic. We also understand that because of our demand for containerboard and the opportunity we had with Jackson, that as we've always looked at the paper business, that it was the right decision to make for all the reasons we've talked about over the last six months to utilize the asset and exit someone of this market. And regarding our customers, I'll answer that question by just saying we are running to the demand of our customers large and small, and I'll leave it at that.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks so much, Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.\nMark Connelly: Thank you. Hopefully you can hear me this time.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Good morning, Mark.\nMark Connelly: Great, thanks. Sorry about that. So just a question about maintenance and the changes you made. Some competitors are telling us that it's gotten harder to estimate the cost of maintenance because of changes the way projects are being scheduled. Is that a factor or is this just a change in your plans?\nMark Kowlzan: The increase in cost is related. It goes back to \u2013 we actually added the DeRidder No. 3 machine to this second quarter\u2019s outage plan that was not in the original plan. And so it's not an escalation or an inflationary matter. It's just that we absolutely added an additional outage into this year's plan that did not exist in January. And the DeRidder No. 3 machine work came about during the pandemic year, last year, a lot of work. We avoided some work. We pushed off some work, some work we thought we could get by not having to do even this year. But as January and February wore on, as an example, we observed some opportunity, shall we say, on the DeRidder No. 3 machine that we felt needed to be addressed, and we have the resources and the materials available. So we went ahead and took the machine down for the better part of a week, last week, as a matter of fact, and addressed the opportunities and the requirements on that machine and put it in good shape, and so that machine has gone through its outage. But that would be the qualifying difference in the number that Bob's going to talk to you about. Bob, you want to add a little color to the number? Okay. Anything else?\nMark Connelly: That's super. So just one question on the headwinds. Obviously, last quarter headwinds were more of an overall challenge than they were this quarter and yet you've got some headwinds that got worse. I was hoping you could put some of these headwinds in context for us and tell us, which are still getting worse and where you're getting some relief.\nBob Mundy: Yes, Mark, this is Bob. It's sort of, as I think we said in our prepared remarks, the headwinds continued pretty much as we look from first quarter, the second quarter, we expect them to continue in almost all cost areas except maybe energy as we said. And that's really because of improved usage, not so much from prices getting \u2013 going lower. But in recycled fiber, even certain chemicals, repairs, materials, outside services, I mean, you name it, they all have converting costs. They all have an inflationary component that we see continuing into the second quarter. That \u2013 and of course, freight. Freight is another one that is not that just for all the reasons that Mark had mentioned earlier, there are several things driving it, but that is not going to slow down at all as we go to the \u2013 from the first to the second. So it's pretty much across the board.\nMark Connelly: It's very helpful, unfortunately. Thanks.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.\nGabe Hajde: Mark, Tom, Bob, good morning.\nTom Hassfurther: Good morning Gabe.\nGabe Hajde: You mentioned the heavy maintenance quarter, this period and obviously ended the March quarter with pretty low inventories. I appreciate its volume dependent, but as it sits today, assuming I guess some persistence on the demand side, would you say it probably wouldn't be until the end of the third quarter before you can kind of get your inventory position sort of normalized? And I'm somewhat asking, I mean, the best analogy I can come up with is sort of an accordion of cars going down the freeway. And we haven't had stock-outs in the grocery aisles, but it sounds like somebody \u2013 maybe some of your industrial customers are behind on their inventory/delivery. So I'm kind of curious just as you replenish inventories across the system that it could take even longer than what maybe some folks are anticipating?\nMark Kowlzan: You could look at it that way. Again, I would hope that we get our inventories in a more comfortable position by \u2013 say the end of the third quarter. But don't forget we also have a big outage in the fourth quarter at DeRidder, which we called out last year that is DeRidder number one machine, which is a long outage we've got a boiler work, we've got a lot of recovery boiler work we're doing and then the machine itself and opportunities on the machine. And so that will take a significant amount of tons out in the fourth quarter, that's part of the maintenance cost for the maintenance for the year, but also it impacts how we end the year. Tom?\nTom Hassfurther: Gabe, we have a very, very intense and specific plan in place, understanding that our inventories are going to be extremely tight all the way through the year, given these outages that we have. If in fact the volume doesn't drop off dramatically. The volume drops off dramatically we've got a chance of catching up a little bit, but I think it's important to plan ahead and to plan for what you see as the realistic scenario. We're doing so, we have to do these outages, we have no choice, as you know the \u2013 not only ourselves, but some others in the industry avoided some outages last year. And we just have no choice, but doing them this year. And we'll manage through them and our customers understand, our box plants understand and we've got a great plan in place. So I'm very confident that we'll be able to manage through it, but it's going to be a while before we can catch up on those inventories.\nGabe Hajde: All right, thank you guys for the detail. I guess the second question again, appreciate you guys don't dictate what the publication does. But to the extent you can comment, were you surprised at all in terms of the phase sort of recognition on benchmark prices, and then more importantly I suspect that realization kind of, as you see it flow through your system would be kind of similar to the November hike in that, maybe limited impact in Q2, mostly realized by Q3 and then fully by Q4, is that a fair way to think about it or anything different that you\u2019d guide us towards?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, you know, Gabe we don't comment much on our pricing, other than to say we have a very disciplined approach to the \u2013 to our price increase. Across the customer base that's 15,000 plus. We have a variety of contracts, agreements, et cetera, which roll-in typically over about a 90-day period. So you can \u2013 you know \u2013 what occurred for pulp and paper, I mean, I understand where it's somewhat where they're coming from, it's now fully in place. So I think you can kind of take that and take what I told you about the 90-day period and kind of roll that out. And that'll give you an indication of when that gets \u2013 when that price increase gets fully implemented.\nGabe Hajde: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.\nPhil Ng: Hey guys congratulations on another strong quarter. You know box demand was obviously really strong this year and it's been pretty impressive. Any color on the makeup of the end markets and if that profile in the growth side have changed much since perhaps the back half of last year versus how things are kind of shaping up this year?\nMark Kowlzan: I didn't know here the second half of the question. Phil, can you repeat that again?\nPhil Ng: Yeah, I'm just trying to get a better feel for the end market profile growth that you're seeing versus second half of 2020 versus now. Is it more broad-based, were there any end markets that stood out this year versus let's say the second half of 2020?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think the number one market that probably stands out more so than any is e-com, but \u2013 it's an e-com is spread out along all sorts of product lines today and all sorts of different companies. So that's obviously one of the trends we talked about it last time that it's become apparent that the consumer preference for e-commerce has accelerated. We're seeing something that probably would have taken three to five years to take place. That's now compressed into six months or a year because of the pandemic, that's one of the drivers. But I got to tell you that, across the board, with this broad customer base of 15,000 plus customers with the exception of just a few small industries, it's incredibly busy and demand is very high. So it's \u2013 I'm very, very, very pleased with the trends we're seeing. And I think that's kind of an indicator of the potential going forward as well.\nPhil Ng: But Tom, are you starting to see like an uptick, let's say in some of these manufacturing end markets that weren't as obvious last year, I'm just trying to get a feel to mix. I know the e-com piece is going to be strong, is it little more broad-based? And I mean \u2013 I assume it has to be just given how strong the demand is?\nTom Hassfurther: No, it\u2019s \u2013 yeah, you're absolutely right. It is broad-based no question about it. It's broad-based and in fact, we've got customers who could be even busier if they could get \u2013 if they could get supplied with some of their products. They've got very tight supplies on their product as well of either ingredients or parts that go into their products. And otherwise they'd be even busier. So there's even a good backlog building.\nPhil Ng: Got it. And then you mentioned earlier that inventory is going to be pretty tight throughout the year, is that going to be a governor in terms of your ability to kind of supply boxes to your customer or you have it in a pretty good spot in terms of being able to kind of supply that inventory?\nTom Hassfurther: No. When I talk about inventory is being tight, we won't have some of the comfort level that we might like to have, but we'll certainly have enough inventory to supply all of our customers with their needs.\nPhil Ng: Okay. That's helpful. And just one last quick one for me, appreciating Jackson is not fully ramped up and the capital's not in yet. Do you see from an operating cost standpoint, as you kind of continue to run this year, does that come down a little bit this year or is that going to be more of 2022 event once you have it fully ramping into that second phase?\nMark Kowlzan: As I said earlier, just in the last six months we've taken a significant amount of cost out and opportunities that were discovered on a daily basis and that will continue through the year. And I\u2019d say we've learned a lot of things about the machine, but machine right from the get-go has been an extremely efficient, productive machine for us. And we've made hundreds and hundreds of changes in the process from the pulp mill and the liquor cycle, and wood yard, and on-and-on-and-on that have helped us take some costs out of the finished product. So we're very pleased with where we are today and we expect to continue that effort. And get the set up for the first major phase outage next year.\nPhil Ng: Okay, super. Thank you guys.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.\nNeel Kumar: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nNeel Kumar: I know you touched on increases in recycled fiber prices earlier, but I was just curious whether you've seen any inflation in your virgin fiber baskets. Are there any large differences in terms of those virgin fiber prices by region across your network mills?\nMark Kowlzan: That's been fairly flat, you see the weather related phenomenon that impacts pulpwood, but in general, it's up slightly, but nothing significant like some of the other factors that we've talked about again, it's primarily weather related events, not demand absolutely demand related.\nNeel Kumar: Great. That's helpful. And then in Paper, can you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of demand trends so far in April? And how should we generally think about the flow through of the price increases for uncoated freesheet. Is there a lag similar to what we've seen in corrugated about a quarter or so?\nMark Kowlzan: No, I think again the \u2013 what was reported in the index Friday night, it pretty well sums it up in terms of how much of the price increase has been picked up and we would agree with what the index is saying with where we are with our cut size pricing and uncoated freesheet pricing. And then as far as again demand is, we gave you our absolute volume and where we are, but the price is moving up accordingly. And I think it's reflected well in what the index is reporting.\nNeel Kumar: Got it. And my question on the uncoated freesheet pricing is actually more of when it flows through from the index to your customer pricing, is there a lag somewhere to what you've seen in corrugated?\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah. I mean, there's always little bit of a lag that takes place from the time you announce it. And then the time that the index actually calls it out and picks it up and your deliveries and your invoicing, and billing, et cetera.\nNeel Kumar: Right. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: But it's \u2013 you're talking about \u2013 you're talking about a couple of months of a lag type activity. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hey, regarding the increase in CapEx guidance for what you talked about in the previous quarter, is that all due to Jackson or are you pulling forward or accelerating any other kind of high return projects or any other areas that you'd call out? And then understanding you're not giving, poor guidance, but is there a way to think about what normalized CapEx for PCA would be when you get finished at Jackson?\nBob Mundy: The first part of your question is yes. Jackson is the primary mover. That's increasing the CapEx for the year. The second part of your question is, as far as what's normal in the new world, I can't answer that. We're always mindful of what opportunities we have. And we were very fortunate that a few years back we undertook a heavy reinvestment in the box plants and recapitalizing the opportunities in lot of our plants. And taking care of the mills in the manner that we do, so if you look at our capital effectiveness and the returns on our capital spending we're very pleased with the returns that we see. And so capital is a matter of affordability and opportunity, and obviously I don't ever see us not having opportunities and then it becomes a matter of affordability. And so I think that's the way you have to look at it. But we \u2013 for the most part, we always have a portfolio of opportunities identified in the box plants and the mills that we go after short-term and long-term, and that's what's giving us this opportunity to be able to take care of the volume growth that you are seeing.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. And then Tom, earlier you talked about raw material availability issues and I think you specifically called out adhesives and glue, understanding the cost headwinds are continuing into 2Q, in terms of outright shortages or just not being able to secure the raw materials. Has that gotten material materially better as some of these Gulf Coast plants have come back online or is that still a nagging issue and is it something that's, impacted sales or orders or any kind of \u2013 any kind of color you can give there?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Anthony, I think we're fortunate. We got ahead of this early in the equation, we took some measures to make sure that we would not be caught assured as maybe perhaps some others. We're still hearing from suppliers, some are saying that things should be back to a more normalized rate by the third quarter. Some others are saying, no maybe not so much, the plants \u2013 the chemical plants are back up, but some of these \u2013 some of the chemicals that they make that go into the adhesives are what I'd say less important to those chemical plants than other chemicals. So we're planning to do what we need to do throughout the year to make sure that we're taking care of and \u2013 we don't have any customers that don't have boxes because of adhesive, we'll be able to satisfy all those needs. But it's going to be \u2013 it's more costly to do it, there's no question about it. And I think we'll continue to have that headwind probably through the year. At least that's what we're planning on, but again we've got the contingency plans in place to take care of that.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Kyle White with Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I know you talked about recycled fiber costs in general increasing from these current levels, but could you provide a specific near term outlook and assumption for OCC going forward?\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, Kyle. Certainly expect them to move up in the second quarter and for the full year we usually don't go out that far, but they could be up \u2013 they could be up close to the 50% over last year's average something in that ballpark is what it seems like right now.\nKyle White: Got it. With the containerboard price increase in November, another recent one here in March and April, I assume it's expected to fully offset the increased inflation headwinds you're seeing or expect going forward. And do you think this new pricing level reflects how tight the market is?\nMark Kowlzan: Again, it's \u2013 I think the pricing is a reflection of the demand in the market for the product. And then obviously there are inflationary factors that weigh into a producer's position in how they have to operate, but demand is the overall driver of what's moving these two price increases.\nTom Hassfurther: And I'd also add that demand is up significantly worldwide, not this is just domestic this is around the world.\nKyle White: Got it. I'll turn it over and good luck in the year.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, next question.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Cleve Rueckert with UBS.\nCleve Rueckert: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions and there's two quick ones for me. I'm wondering if you can give maybe just a little clarity, I know Q1 was pretty dynamic with the weather and everything, but how did volumes trend in corrugated shipments on a per day basis versus that 8.3% that they grew for the quarter? I'm just wondering how the quarter developed from a demand perspective.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, January was obviously up, February slowed down a little bit and it was all weather related. And then March, it was incredibly high again because we were catching it, not only the demand in March, but also we were catching up some of what we did get shipped in February.\nCleve Rueckert: Okay. So would you \u2013 I mean, would you say demand was kind of flat around that and low in February and catch up in March?\nMark Kowlzan: Demand was \u2013 obviously was up significantly during the quarter and it was pretty much steady January, February, March. It's just that as our numbers would have been significantly higher for March because of the weather related issues down in Texas, as an example where we have a large footprint, we didn't get all the volume out the door in the month and it attracted over into end of the March. So I'm just kind of giving you a little flavor. January very strong, February would appear to be not quite as strong, but it still was very strong it just looked like it wasn't quite as strong because we didn't get the shipments and then March jumped up dramatically. But that was driven primarily by some of the shipments we didn't have in. We didn't get done in February. So overall, when I look back, I say the demand was \u2013 as we said, coming out of the fourth quarter with incredibly high demand, it remained essentially very close to that going through the entire first quarter. And now you're seeing same indication starting into the second quarter.\nCleve Rueckert: That's very clear, thanks for that color. And I know you touched on it a bit earlier, but I just \u2013 I want to ask a little bit more directly, given the tightness in the corrugated market. I mean, are you seeing any customers or maybe box buyers more generally, not specifically your customers switching away from paper-based packaging because they simply can't get enough?\nMark Kowlzan: No, it's quite the opposite to tell you the truth. Because of our sustainability story that we have in our business, because of the way we operate this business, the 90% plus of the boxes to get recycled, et cetera, people want to be in paper. They don't want to be in plastic anymore. So as an example, we've got some customers that have been shipping in plastic pouches their e-commerce and plastic pouches, and they want to move back to boxes. So there's \u2013 I mean, that's a huge segment that's going out in a plastic pouch as an example. So I think there are great opportunities going forward for paper-based packaging.\nCleve Rueckert: That's it for me. Thank you very much for the questions. Appreciate it.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, next question.\nOperator: Mr. Kowlzan, I see that there are no further questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Everyone, thank you for joining us and I look forward to talking with you in July for the second quarter earnings call. Everyone, stay safe and be well. Talk to you in July. Have a good day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. Total volume in our corrugated products plants was up 6.6% versus last year and equaled the all-time record for total box shipments that we just set in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shipments per day were up 8.3% over last year, which set a new first quarter record for us. Strong domestic demand drove outside sales volume of containerboard 13% above last year's first quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $0.26 per share above the first quarter of 2020 and up $0.52 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as we continued to implement our November 2020 announced price increases during the quarter and we began the implementation of our announced March increase. Export containerboard prices were up $0.05 per share versus last year's first quarter and up $0.04 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. I'll now turn it back to Mark. Hey, George, this is Tom. I'll just answer that real quickly. We had a number of export commitments that had to take place \u2013 that were running over from the previous year that we had to take care of in the first quarter to maintain our relationships, and so we just had to get that taken care of. And we knew full well that we'd also be able to supply our box plants, although with a very tight inventory. Good question, George. First of all, through 14 days, our bookings are up 16% versus a year ago. So obviously the volume remains very robust and we're obviously very pleased with those kinds of numbers and the trend that has just continued coming right out of the fourth quarter of last year and continued into this year. There's no way customers can, in essence, hoard or order ahead or anything like that with the demand we're having right now. And a lot of our customers report business conditions as good as what we're talking about. And they're just trying to keep their head above water. And we obviously are keeping them supplied with boxes. Yes. Mark, we obviously lost a significant production time in those box plants. We made up for a lot of that in the subsequent month, but it was a very, very difficult month. The ag crop, obviously, down in down the Rio Grande Valley was dramatically impacted, which also impacted our volumes in that area. In addition, as you may be aware, the impact of the chemical plants to provide the chemicals that make up our glues and adhesives was definitely impacted, and we've been suffering shortages of that product across all the companies. And we've had to take some extraordinary measures to make sure that we can continue to run at much higher expense to do so. Hey, Mark, this is Tom. We have gotten most of the increase from November in the first quarter. We do have some of that trails into the second quarter and even into the beginning of the third quarter, just based on contracts. But the lion's share has been accomplished in the first quarter. Hey, Adam, this is Tom. It's virtually impossible to do. Let me tell you, because our customer base across the board with the exception of a few are up dramatically. And so it's not just e-commerce as an example, being the only segment that's really driving this, it's a lot of segments that are going on. And I think obviously the stimulus helps and has been a plus for us. But again, as Mark said, we've got to wait until things settle down to really be able to get our arms around what's really going on in the world. Well, I think what we're seeing is we're seeing the exact same thing that we saw starting in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter was up dramatically. It rolled right into the first quarter, and now it's rolling right into the second quarter. So to try to predict it would have been difficult to do and we expected just like a lot of other people expected that the fourth quarter, that things might slow down a little bit from the fourth quarter, but they just haven't. So it remains incredibly robust and I think we've got a lot of customers that are way behind on their shipments as well. So I think it will continue going forward for awhile. Good morning Gabe. Gabe, we have a very, very intense and specific plan in place, understanding that our inventories are going to be extremely tight all the way through the year, given these outages that we have. If in fact the volume doesn't drop off dramatically. The volume drops off dramatically we've got a chance of catching up a little bit, but I think it's important to plan ahead and to plan for what you see as the realistic scenario. We're doing so, we have to do these outages, we have no choice, as you know the \u2013 not only ourselves, but some others in the industry avoided some outages last year. And we just have no choice, but doing them this year. And we'll manage through them and our customers understand, our box plants understand and we've got a great plan in place. So I'm very confident that we'll be able to manage through it, but it's going to be a while before we can catch up on those inventories. Well, I think the number one market that probably stands out more so than any is e-com, but \u2013 it's an e-com is spread out along all sorts of product lines today and all sorts of different companies. So that's obviously one of the trends we talked about it last time that it's become apparent that the consumer preference for e-commerce has accelerated. We're seeing something that probably would have taken three to five years to take place. That's now compressed into six months or a year because of the pandemic, that's one of the drivers. But I got to tell you that, across the board, with this broad customer base of 15,000 plus customers with the exception of just a few small industries, it's incredibly busy and demand is very high. So it's \u2013 I'm very, very, very pleased with the trends we're seeing. And I think that's kind of an indicator of the potential going forward as well. No, it's \u2013 yeah, you're absolutely right. It is broad-based no question about it. It's broad-based and in fact, we've got customers who could be even busier if they could get \u2013 if they could get supplied with some of their products. They've got very tight supplies on their product as well of either ingredients or parts that go into their products. And otherwise they'd be even busier. So there's even a good backlog building. No. When I talk about inventory is being tight, we won't have some of the comfort level that we might like to have, but we'll certainly have enough inventory to supply all of our customers with their needs. Well, Anthony, I think we're fortunate. We got ahead of this early in the equation, we took some measures to make sure that we would not be caught assured as maybe perhaps some others. We're still hearing from suppliers, some are saying that things should be back to a more normalized rate by the third quarter. Some others are saying, no maybe not so much, the plants \u2013 the chemical plants are back up, but some of these \u2013 some of the chemicals that they make that go into the adhesives are what I'd say less important to those chemical plants than other chemicals. So we're planning to do what we need to do throughout the year to make sure that we're taking care of and \u2013 we don't have any customers that don't have boxes because of adhesive, we'll be able to satisfy all those needs. But it's going to be \u2013 it's more costly to do it, there's no question about it. And I think we'll continue to have that headwind probably through the year. At least that's what we're planning on, but again we've got the contingency plans in place to take care of that. And I'd also add that demand is up significantly worldwide, not this is just domestic this is around the world."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, and again, I appreciate everybody participating today in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2021 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results, and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide additional details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions. Thanks Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter was $16 million with sales of $165 million or a 10% margin compared to the first quarter of 2020's EBITDA of $42 million and sales of $217 million or 19% margin. As expected sales volume was about 22% below last year, as we ran only one machine at the Jackson, Alabama mill this quarter versus both machines running in the first quarter of 2020. First quarter paper prices and mix were almost 3% below last year. However, prices began to move higher in the latter part of the quarter, resulting from the announced paper price increases and averaged 1% higher than fourth quarter 2020 average prices. Thanks Bob. Regarding the conversion of the number three machine at Jackson, Alabama our current plans are to continue running the machine on linerboard as demand warrants. In a manner similar as to how we ran in the first quarter until the scheduled first phase outage is taken in the second quarter of 2022. The converted machine is expected to operate at an initial production rate of approximately 75% of its new capacity. The second phase outage work is planned for mid-2023 with the machine reaching its run rate capacity of 2,000 tons per day by the end of 2023. This phased conversion over the next few years will provide much needed internal linerboard supply. This gives us a runway for maintaining an optimal integration level and enables us to further optimize and enhance our current mill capacity in box plant operations. We're committed to being fully integrated and we have a track record of ramping up production from machine conversions according to our customers demand requirements. Yes. I think everyone could understand that without the capital investment. We are running probably in that high third, low fourth quartile costs portion of a curve. The beauty of it is though, it's very productive, very efficient and providing us the critical tons we need to run the box system. We've also in the last four months, we've taken considerable cost out as we've learned more about the machine, but the machine has proven to be quite an extremely efficient machine, but someone might think about the capital spending that we are undertaking as we speak that we'll go through next year and the year after. Okay. Next question, please. Good morning, Mark. Thanks. No one asked us in January what we really produced in Jackson in the fourth quarter. But if you think about what we are producing and what we produced in the fourth quarter and what we produced in the first quarter, the Jackson No. 3 machine on a run rate and looking at its grade mix, it's producing a little over 100,000 tons a quarter. It's in that range. And so on an annualized basis, it's providing an incremental 400,000-plus tons a year to the run rate. And part of the reason, again, if you think about the filings, we did not have the machine listed as a true linerboard machine. So we still consider it a paper machine providing us with so much needed linerboard right now. Fast forward, to help you with your math; if you assume the 4.3 million plus the 400,000 tons, you get pretty close to your number. The other factor that we'll give you a little understanding on is the project I mentioned on the call just a few minutes ago, the Wallula OCC project. Not only was that going to be a fiber flexibility opportunity for the Wallula mill, but anybody that understands fiber physics, recycled fibers of any kind drain and dry much more easily than virgin fiber. And so by mixing now the OCC and with our virgin kraft fiber at the Wallula mill, we're seeing as we expected much higher speeds on the machines, and in particular, the No. 3 machine, the drainage pressing drawing is far superior than it was before. And so starting in February, when we started the OCC plant up, we've been averaging close to 100 tons a day more production on that machine. And so that's another piece of the incremental first quarter tons that was built in, and that you'll see for the rest of the year also. So that \u2013 go ahead. Well, the whole mill, because don't forget the No. 2 machine is sitting there making medium. We had talked all along that that mill had the opportunity to get close to that 600,000 ton annualized run rate for both machines and where they're essentially right now. Let me \u2013 I'm going to say a few things, and then Tom and Bob can add to that. We were very fortunate that we were not as severely impacted as some competitors. The DeRidder mill was able to run through this. We had transportation, logistics problems trying to move raw materials in and finished goods out. We had the bigger impact in the Texas region, in the Dallas metroplex area with our box plants. We had some of the box plants, obviously down. Tom, do you want to add a little color to the two-week period when we had a lot of the severe weather? Okay. Thanks, Mark. Next question, please. Good morning, Mark. Hello? Yes, Mark. Next question, please. Good morning, Adam. Thanks. I think the way we would answer that is that there's still so much uncertainty in the world around us. If you think about the number that Tom just gave you for the volume, if a year ago somebody told you that volume was going to be up 16% year-over-year and on a given month, no one would believe you. And so until the pandemic winds down and we come back to some at least sense of what we think the new world normality will be, we believe it's in our best interests, in the shareholder's best interest to not give guidance. Regarding the first part of the question, until again, if you think about the biggest demand for cut size paper would be office activity in schools, business activity. Until, again, at such time as businesses resume more of a normal pattern of in-office activity, you won't see cup size demand pickup dramatically. As schools come back and go back to a more normalized, school day function, more cut size use will take place in schools. So I would expect starting in the fall semester for the new school year that more demand will take place. I can't quantify that for you. I would just say that it should move up positively. We do think ultimately there the pandemic has created a new opportunity for people that they'll work from home, they'll work part days. I mean, people that are in the business world are obviously trying to understand how we will all run our businesses in the future, and whether we'll have people in the office full-time, part-time, flex-time. And so paper demand will go along with that. We are anticipating that there will be some permanent demand destruction that comes out of the pandemic. We also understand that because of our demand for containerboard and the opportunity we had with Jackson, that as we've always looked at the paper business, that it was the right decision to make for all the reasons we've talked about over the last six months to utilize the asset and exit someone of this market. And regarding our customers, I'll answer that question by just saying we are running to the demand of our customers large and small, and I'll leave it at that. Next question, please. Yes. Good morning, Mark. The increase in cost is related. It goes back to \u2013 we actually added the DeRidder No. 3 machine to this second quarter's outage plan that was not in the original plan. And so it's not an escalation or an inflationary matter. It's just that we absolutely added an additional outage into this year's plan that did not exist in January. And the DeRidder No. 3 machine work came about during the pandemic year, last year, a lot of work. We avoided some work. We pushed off some work, some work we thought we could get by not having to do even this year. But as January and February wore on, as an example, we observed some opportunity, shall we say, on the DeRidder No. 3 machine that we felt needed to be addressed, and we have the resources and the materials available. So we went ahead and took the machine down for the better part of a week, last week, as a matter of fact, and addressed the opportunities and the requirements on that machine and put it in good shape, and so that machine has gone through its outage. But that would be the qualifying difference in the number that Bob's going to talk to you about. Bob, you want to add a little color to the number? Okay. Anything else? Next question, please. You could look at it that way. Again, I would hope that we get our inventories in a more comfortable position by \u2013 say the end of the third quarter. But don't forget we also have a big outage in the fourth quarter at DeRidder, which we called out last year that is DeRidder number one machine, which is a long outage we've got a boiler work, we've got a lot of recovery boiler work we're doing and then the machine itself and opportunities on the machine. And so that will take a significant amount of tons out in the fourth quarter, that's part of the maintenance cost for the maintenance for the year, but also it impacts how we end the year. Tom? Well, you know, Gabe we don't comment much on our pricing, other than to say we have a very disciplined approach to the \u2013 to our price increase. Across the customer base that's 15,000 plus. We have a variety of contracts, agreements, et cetera, which roll-in typically over about a 90-day period. So you can \u2013 you know \u2013 what occurred for pulp and paper, I mean, I understand where it's somewhat where they're coming from, it's now fully in place. So I think you can kind of take that and take what I told you about the 90-day period and kind of roll that out. And that'll give you an indication of when that gets \u2013 when that price increase gets fully implemented. Next question please. I didn't know here the second half of the question. Phil, can you repeat that again? As I said earlier, just in the last six months we've taken a significant amount of cost out and opportunities that were discovered on a daily basis and that will continue through the year. And I'd say we've learned a lot of things about the machine, but machine right from the get-go has been an extremely efficient, productive machine for us. And we've made hundreds and hundreds of changes in the process from the pulp mill and the liquor cycle, and wood yard, and on-and-on-and-on that have helped us take some costs out of the finished product. So we're very pleased with where we are today and we expect to continue that effort. And get the set up for the first major phase outage next year. Thank you, next question. Good morning. That's been fairly flat, you see the weather related phenomenon that impacts pulpwood, but in general, it's up slightly, but nothing significant like some of the other factors that we've talked about again, it's primarily weather related events, not demand absolutely demand related. No, I think again the \u2013 what was reported in the index Friday night, it pretty well sums it up in terms of how much of the price increase has been picked up and we would agree with what the index is saying with where we are with our cut size pricing and uncoated freesheet pricing. And then as far as again demand is, we gave you our absolute volume and where we are, but the price is moving up accordingly. And I think it's reflected well in what the index is reporting. Yeah. I mean, there's always little bit of a lag that takes place from the time you announce it. And then the time that the index actually calls it out and picks it up and your deliveries and your invoicing, and billing, et cetera. But it's \u2013 you're talking about \u2013 you're talking about a couple of months of a lag type activity. Next question, please. Good morning. Thank you. Next question, please. Yeah, Kyle. Certainly expect them to move up in the second quarter and for the full year we usually don't go out that far, but they could be up \u2013 they could be up close to the 50% over last year's average something in that ballpark is what it seems like right now. Again, it's \u2013 I think the pricing is a reflection of the demand in the market for the product. And then obviously there are inflationary factors that weigh into a producer's position in how they have to operate, but demand is the overall driver of what's moving these two price increases. Thank you, next question. Well, January was obviously up, February slowed down a little bit and it was all weather related. And then March, it was incredibly high again because we were catching it, not only the demand in March, but also we were catching up some of what we did get shipped in February. Demand was \u2013 obviously was up significantly during the quarter and it was pretty much steady January, February, March. It's just that as our numbers would have been significantly higher for March because of the weather related issues down in Texas, as an example where we have a large footprint, we didn't get all the volume out the door in the month and it attracted over into end of the March. So I'm just kind of giving you a little flavor. January very strong, February would appear to be not quite as strong, but it still was very strong it just looked like it wasn't quite as strong because we didn't get the shipments and then March jumped up dramatically. But that was driven primarily by some of the shipments we didn't have in. We didn't get done in February. So overall, when I look back, I say the demand was \u2013 as we said, coming out of the fourth quarter with incredibly high demand, it remained essentially very close to that going through the entire first quarter. And now you're seeing same indication starting into the second quarter. No, it's quite the opposite to tell you the truth. Because of our sustainability story that we have in our business, because of the way we operate this business, the 90% plus of the boxes to get recycled, et cetera, people want to be in paper. They don't want to be in plastic anymore. So as an example, we've got some customers that have been shipping in plastic pouches their e-commerce and plastic pouches, and they want to move back to boxes. So there's \u2013 I mean, that's a huge segment that's going out in a plastic pouch as an example. So I think there are great opportunities going forward for paper-based packaging. Thank you, next question. Yes. Everyone, thank you for joining us and I look forward to talking with you in July for the second quarter earnings call. Everyone, stay safe and be well. Talk to you in July. Have a good day. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Bob Mundy",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. For the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $192 million and free cash flow of $107 million. The primary uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $85 million and common stock dividends of $95 million. We ended the quarter with $983 million of cash on hand or $1.1 billion including marketable securities. Our liquidity at March 31 was $1.5 billion. I want to update you on our full year guidance for a couple of items that we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and scope of work for the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills has changed and the new total company estimated cost impact for the year is $0.97 per share. The actual impact in the first quarter $0.10 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.30 per share in the second quarter, $0.16 in the third and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter. Also our capital spending estimate for the year has changed to a range of $650 million to $675 million as we have now announced our plans for the conversion of the number three paper machine at our Jackson mill to linerboard. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yes, Mark, this is Bob. It's sort of, as I think we said in our prepared remarks, the headwinds continued pretty much as we look from first quarter, the second quarter, we expect them to continue in almost all cost areas except maybe energy as we said. And that's really because of improved usage, not so much from prices getting \u2013 going lower. But in recycled fiber, even certain chemicals, repairs, materials, outside services, I mean, you name it, they all have converting costs. They all have an inflationary component that we see continuing into the second quarter. That \u2013 and of course, freight. Freight is another one that is not that just for all the reasons that Mark had mentioned earlier, there are several things driving it, but that is not going to slow down at all as we go to the \u2013 from the first to the second. So it's pretty much across the board. The first part of your question is yes. Jackson is the primary mover. That's increasing the CapEx for the year. The second part of your question is, as far as what's normal in the new world, I can't answer that. We're always mindful of what opportunities we have. And we were very fortunate that a few years back we undertook a heavy reinvestment in the box plants and recapitalizing the opportunities in lot of our plants. And taking care of the mills in the manner that we do, so if you look at our capital effectiveness and the returns on our capital spending we're very pleased with the returns that we see. And so capital is a matter of affordability and opportunity, and obviously I don't ever see us not having opportunities and then it becomes a matter of affordability. And so I think that's the way you have to look at it. But we \u2013 for the most part, we always have a portfolio of opportunities identified in the box plants and the mills that we go after short-term and long-term, and that's what's giving us this opportunity to be able to take care of the volume growth that you are seeing."

Your host will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'm going to be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2022 net income of $212 million or $2.31 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2022 net income was $215 million or $2.35 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 net income of $262 million or $2.76 per share. Fourth quarter net income -- fourth quarter net sales were $1.98 billion in 2022 and $2.04 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $409 million in 2022 and $463 million in 2021. Excluding special items, we also reported full year 2022 earnings of $1.04 billion or $11.14 per share compared to 2021 earnings of $894 million or $9.39 per share. Net sales were $8.5 billion in 2022 and $7.7 billion in 2021. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2022 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 net income included special items primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. Details of all the special items for the year 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.41 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2022 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lower volumes in our Packaging segment $1.14 and Paper segment $0.02. We also had higher operating costs of $0.48, primarily from inflation on energy, chemicals, labor and benefits, supplies, repair materials and services and other indirect and fixed costs. Freight and logistics expenses were unfavorable $0.13 along with higher depreciation expense, $0.09, higher converting costs, $0.06 and higher scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.01. These items were partially offset by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment of $1.18 and Packaging segment -- and Paper segment rather of $0.21. A lower share count resulting from share repurchases $0.08; lower interest expense, $0.04 and a lower tax rate, $0.01. Results were $0.13 above the fourth quarter guidance of $2.22 per share, primarily due to higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower freight and logistics expenses, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases and a lower tax rate. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $392 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $461 million and sales of $1.9 billion or a 24.5% margin. For the full year 2022, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding the special items, was $1.8 billion with sales of $7.8 billion or a 23.8% margin compared to full year 2021 EBITDA of $1.7 billion with sales of $7.1 billion or a 23.9% margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was below expectations for the quarter, causing us to run our containerboard system to these lower demand levels. Our employees did a very good job with their cost management and process optimization efforts at these lower production rates to offset the negative volume impact. Total economic-related downtime for the fourth quarter was approximately 231,000 tons. The scheduled maintenance outage and conversion work at our Jackson, Alabama mill was completed successfully during the fourth quarter, and we restarted the mill earlier this month after being down as a result of the lower demand. The number three machine achieved its first phase design capacity and is producing a very high-quality virgin linerboard. However, based on current containerboard demand levels, we decided to move the second phase of the conversion work from this spring to next year in 2024. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.19 per share above the fourth quarter of 2021 and flat compared to the third quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.01 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and down $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022. Corrugated product shipments were down 8.7% per work day and down 10.2% in total with one less workday compared to last year's fourth quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 131,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter and 38,000 tons below the third quarter of 2022. The lower demand in our Packaging segment was driven by several items. The inventory correction in both boxes and our customers' product has been more prolonged than what we originally anticipated at the start. Inflationary pressures on the consumers have also added to the problem by reducing the consumers discretionary spending capabilities. In addition, consumer behavior changed very quickly as we exited the extreme COVID period, resulting in more of a preference towards travel, entertainment and experience versus that of tangible goods. Containerboard and box demand continues to be negatively impacted from the deterioration in U.S. and global economic conditions, rising interest rates and a cooler housing market. As we move from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we estimate the rate of shipments per day to be fairly similar as we expect many of these conditions to continue. However, there are four additional shipping days in the first quarter, so total actual shipments will be higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In spite of the numerous issues currently impacting demand, we continue to perform at levels above pre-COVID and anticipate our first quarter shipments to exceed first quarter 2019 shipments by approximately 6% on a per day basis. Now I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $39 million with sales of $154 million or a 25.7% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 EBITDA of $26 million on sales of $143 million or an 18.4% margin. For the full year 2022, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items, was $132 million with sales of $622 million or 21.3% margin compared to the full year 2021 EBITDA of $72 million with sales of $600 million or a 12% margin. Prices and mix were up 21% from last year's fourth quarter and moved 3% higher from the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. Sales volume was about 11% below last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to paper sales from the Jackson Mill's number one machine, which we included in last year's results as well as having -- we optimized our product and customer mix since that time as we transitioned away from paper volume at Jackson mill. As expected, volume was down approximately 11% versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2022 and that also included the remaining inventory from the Jackson mill. The management team and all of the employees of the Paper business have done a tremendous job over the last several quarters to optimize our inventory, product mix and cost structure in order to deliver outstanding results for 2022, and I'm confident that we can maintain this momentum through 2023. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $420 million with capital expenditures of $247 million and free cash flow of $173 million. Other cash payments during the fourth quarter included dividend payments of $116 million, cash tax payments of $56 million and net interest payments of $31 million. We also spent $380 million during the quarter to repurchase just over 3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.70 per share. That brings our total repurchases, over the last 5 quarters, to almost 5.5 million shares at an average price of $130.62 per share. Repurchases of our outstanding stock and dividend payments made during the past year, represent 63% of cash from operations or 91% of net income that was returned to shareholders in 2022. For the full year 2022, cash from operations was $1.5 billion. Capital spending was $824 million, with free cash flow of $671 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate in 2022 was 24.5%, and our final reported cash tax rate was 20%. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $475 million, and DD&A is expected to be approximately $485 million. We estimate dividend payments of $450 million and cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $53 million. Our full year interest expense in 2023 is expected to be approximately $72 million and net cash interest payments should be about $74 million. The estimate for our 2023 book effective tax rate is 25%. Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2023, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, it's expected to be in total, $0.67 per share versus $0.99 per share in 2022. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2023 is $0.11 per share in the first quarter, $0.14 in the second, $0.22 in the third and $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. The hard work of our employees, along with strong relationships between us and our customers and suppliers delivered outstanding results for PCA in 2022. New annual company records were achieved for revenue, cash from operations, net income and earnings per share. And as Bob just mentioned, 91% of our net income was returned to our shareholders from dividend payments and stock repurchases. We successfully completed or substantially completed significant cost reduction and process improvement projects at our mills including a 30-megawatt steam turbine and first phase of the number three machine conversion to containerboard at the Jackson mill. This effort included fiber flexibility projects at the Wallula and Jackson Mills and many other key initiatives. We also completed numerous high return and high efficiency improvement projects in our corrugated products plants that will allow us to better optimize our entire packaging business for the future and deliver profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities for our customers and shareholders. The significant capital investments we've made during the year had complete involvement of PCA personnel from project conception, preliminary and detailed engineering, all the way through to project implementation and start-up. These projects and initiatives achieved numerous tactical and strategic benefits while improving our industry-leading return on invested capital to just under 20%. As we've discussed on these calls many times before, by the end of 2022, we would be winding down several years of significant strategic capital investments that position us very well to meet the future needs of our many customers in a very cost-effective manner. We also finalized the optimization of our paper business while delivering excellent financial results that we expect to sustain us well into the future. As economies around the world continue to deal with numerous issues and uncertainties, virtually every individual industry is being negatively impacted in some manner. At PCA, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet which provides the financial flexibility to react quickly to most situations or opportunities in the future. We will also continue our commitment of a balanced approach towards capital allocation in order to maximize our profitability and returns to our shareholders. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter in our Packaging segment, as Tom mentioned, we expect box demand on a per day basis to be similar to the fourth quarter levels, although we expect higher total volume with corrugated products plants having four additional shipping days. Prices will move lower as a result of recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices and we're assuming lower export prices as well. Paper prices should move slightly higher with sales volume fairly flat. Labor costs and certain indirect costs will increase as some containerboard mill operations were temporarily idled during the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate higher labor and benefits costs and other timing-related expenses that occurred at the beginning of a new year as well as higher prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda. However, we expect lower wood and recycled fiber prices, lower energy prices and lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses. Lastly, we expect higher interest and nonoperating pension expenses and a higher tax rate, but we will see some benefit from our recent share repurchases. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $2.23 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question. And one moment while we open George's line. Mr. Staphos please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the details. Congratulations on very good performance in a very, very challenging quarter, at least from our estimation. Mark, my first question, to the extent that you can comment, you took a significant amount of downtime. Production was down sharply, from our own rough calculations it would seem like your inventories now are fairly well balanced relative to your needs, but if you had to qualitatively talk to them, would you say your inventories are normal, below normal, above average? How would you have us think about that?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, it depends on what time period you're looking at. We're living in a dynamic world right now. And if you went back to 2020, let's go back and take a look at what happened there, as the pandemic settled in, and we got into the fall of 2020, and demand picked up dramatically in that period of time, we found ourselves at, quite frankly, an unsustainably low level of inventory per our demand. And it took us the better part of 2021 to drive that inventory to a much more comfortable level. Obviously, part of that was the transportation dilemma that was taking place throughout North America between truck drivers availability and rolling stock availability with the pandemic going on. And then just the demand pressures that were in place. But through the end of 2021 into the early part of 2022, we did achieve the -- what we felt were comfortable levels of inventory to supply our system. As the year 2022 rolled on, we also anticipated certain end-of-year activities with annual outages through the year and then different marketplace conditions into the third and fourth quarter. What we saw happen, obviously, in the fourth quarter was the falloff in demand and so we were able to readjust what we didn't believe should be our new inventory targets understanding that demand was falling off faster than we had anticipated. But also, we had the capacity now with our system improvements and with the Jackson mill being completed that we had a much higher comfort level that we could supply outside sales and our own box plant needs by running to a lower level, which again was a prudent financial decision for us. Anything else, George?\nGeorge Staphos: A couple more, I'll make them quick. The mix given our calculations was quite strong. Is there one thing you would point out or a couple of things you'd point out in terms of what allowed you to put up some fairly strong realizations per ton realizing quarter-to-quarter things can move around. And the same thing on operations and cost if there was one or two things, you had to point out that allows you to put up the quarter that you did. What were the two highlights be? Then I'll turn it over there. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: I'll let Tom talk about the mix question then I can talk about operations.\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes. Well, our mix was solid again, George. Of course, we don't -- with 18,000-plus customers spread across a lot of different industries, it was a relatively strong mix, and we were pleased with that. And I would just -- Yes, go ahead.\nGeorge Staphos: So is that more execution than, Tom, as opposed to any one driver? Is that what you're kind of getting at there?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, yes, I think so. And Mark will talk a little bit more about the cost side. But I think we're also seeing some big benefits from all the investments that we've made, especially in our box plants over the past number of years. And so from a cost basis, we were incredibly good and performed very well.\nMark Kowlzan: To that point, George, in 2021, with the new organization that we put in place in 2019, and we've been doing all of these capital projects in the mills and box plants. But 2021, we worked on probably 53 of our box plants with various sized capital projects going on from big projects and -- to small projects for retooling, recapitalizing converting lines, corrugating operations, significantly improving the unit labor productivity in these facilities. Same thing in the mills we've worked for decades, and we continue to do that every day on improving the efficiencies throughout the operations. And so that was another thing. I think if you look at the cumulative benefit of what Tom just said with the projects that we put in place in the box plants, the ongoing efforts that we continue to perform in our mills, we were able to pivot during the latter part of the year. And even though we took machines down and idled the Jackson mill, we're able to really wring out some efficiencies because of how we operate day-to-day and how we understand where these opportunities are. Again, it's -- it reflects on the organization and how we look at our business 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks very much. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Thanks, George. Next question please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Roxland from Truist Securities. Mr. Roxland please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Roxland: Thanks, Mark, Bob, Tom, Ted for taking my questions. Just on Jackson, how do you plan to operate that mill going forward? Obviously, the first phase is behind you. You've postponed now the second phase to 2024. Given that demand remains challenging, as you've noted, you operate that convert line? And do you have the flexibility if the manner remains challenging to operate white paper on it given still strong line paper markets?\nMark Kowlzan: No, the Jackson mill now is a containerboard operation. That mill, for all intents and purposes, will not make any white paper ever again. It's truly the work we just completed in terms of the scope of work that we set out has achieved everything that the first phase was supposed to. We are now running very efficiently, very effectively. We started up just the week before last, and we ran last week, and we've been producing Grade A paper converting it in our box plants, but we'll be able to take advantage now of the project's cost benefit opportunities. There's the work that was done, and we talked about this last year would help us on the input cost side of the equation with energy usage, labor-type impacts, fiber yield, and so we will see those benefits. Now it depends also on how much production we see on the big machine. We're also ramping up the machine as we speak. The machine for the last 1.5 years from when we converted it in 2021 and ran through 2022, we were producing probably 1,275 tons a day average in that range. And right now, currently, we're somewhere in that 1,300-ton a day range and just getting comfortable with all of the new equipment. Essentially, we have a new paper machine on our hands here and then the pulp mill has been significantly rebuilt and new OCC plant. So there's a lot of new infrastructure in the mill that we're getting used to running, but we're also going to look at what the opportunity is. The second phase of work that we can choose to do when the timing is right, involves 23 new additional high-pressure dryer cans, a new forset reel at the dry end of the paper machine and then a new shoe press in the press section to enhance pricing and improve the drawing. That will take place when we need the tons. So that's to be determined, but we have the luxury of deciding that when we need to decide that. But the first phase of the work has been done extremely well. We're very pleased with what we see. So now we'll take advantage of what we have in place. And as we've done for many years, we'll wring out these benefits and these efficiencies from day to day here. So I'm pretty optimistic on what we have at Jackson. The number one machine, the smaller machine is down. It's idle temporarily. It will be available if demand determines that we should run that. And so again, I think current times, we will continue to run to demand. The entire system, we also have the annual outages coming up starting next month with our DeRidder and Counce mill. So we have to think about where we need to be with inventory levels and what we have to do to supply our box plant needs. So in that regard, I think Jackson is in a good place, but a lot of opportunity there.\nMichael Roxland: Just quickly, as Jackson started and running obviously it seems to be meeting or exceeding expectations, have you adjusted your operating posture elsewhere just to account for the demand environment? And then just my last question is with inputs coming off, as you noted, have you seen any change in behavior from any of your competitors with respect to downtime or production discipline?\nMark Kowlzan: I'm not going to talk about our competitors. We just -- we're running to demand. We'll continue to run to demand. The Jackson machine is an opportunity for us to provide low-cost, high-quality containerboard into that Southeastern region. But it also means, as you could well assume, the rest of the system will run as we need to run it. But keeping in mind what I just said that we have our big annual outages coming at our two biggest mills being DeRidder and Counce, Tennessee, so our plans were to run a little bit extra inventory build over the next couple of months to ensure that as we go through these big outages, we will supply our needs appropriately.\nMichael Roxland: Got it. I'll turn it over. Good luck in the balance of the year.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Mike. Next question please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. Following up on George's question to some extent. You had talked about how the capital projects really helped on the and capital, particularly the converting operations. You've also talked about how your price mix was really strong in the fourth quarter. And frankly, it's been really good for the last like two years. You've just been doing extraordinarily well, price/mix. How the capital projects help to improve your -- the mix in terms of like more higher value-added packaging that you're providing your customers? Or has your extraordinary performance been kind of just execution also your focus on smaller, more local accounts.\nThomas Hassfurther: Mark, this is Tom. I'll handle that. I mean, keep in mind that we've always said that our customers drive what we do and especially in the box plants, they drive our capital investments. So we grow with them, and we adapt to whatever they need and what they're looking at, and we try to align ourselves with customers that are going to grow going forward, whether they're small or large. So I think that all of that kind of comes together. And our objectives are not only from a cost standpoint, but to satisfy those customers and puts us in a good position, I think, to take advantage of whatever the market opportunities present.\nMark Weintraub: And so sort of getting to the next -- so would you say that the product that you're producing and selling to the customer has changed much? Or it's really -- so the mix has sweetened that way over the last couple of years? Or it's just you've been very, very successful in getting higher pricing?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, I'll give you an example. Our customers are continually having to change to be successful in the marketplace. And if you look at the retail market, as an example, it's very different today than what it was even five years ago. And during COVID, a lot of things occurred, especially inside the big box stores as an example. How do we get the customer back in there? What are they buying? What are they looking for? How do I promote my products and things like that. So there's been a lot of changes, and we assist a lot of our customers in helping make those changes and keeping track of what those trends are.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Great. And then lastly, obviously, demand kind of -- to me at least, it's been astoundingly weak in the last couple of quarters. And you've pointed out the various drivers. Do you have any sense as to how impactful in particular, say, the inventory correction has been in terms of the magnitude of decreases? And are you getting any clarity from customers where we might be in that process? Because it sounds like we're going to continue to see weakness in the first quarter at a minimum. And then a tough question, but are you getting any indications from your customers as to what to expect for the full year? Or is it just not enough visibility?\nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. Let me tackle a couple of these at a time. I think, first of all, let's see if we can help get ourselves calibrated here properly. We're coming out of COVID now, which had a tremendous amount of government stimulus pumped into a market which created, in my opinion, quite a bubble in terms of demand. If you look back historically and you look at box demand historically, it was always pretty level at that 1% to 2% range per year. And all of a sudden, we're jumping up into now double digits and some other things during the COVID years. So that's why I drew the correlation with what happened in -- how we compare now to 2019 and being 6% or maybe slightly above 6% compared to 2019 being up, clearly, some of the errors come out of that bubble, but not all by any means. So it's still a quite healthy demand, in my opinion, when you compare it to pre-COVID. And relative to the inventory correction. Yes, there was a huge inventory correction, and that's still continuing to some extent, as a combination of two things. Still, the supply chain is a big issue for our customers. And as you know, China just recently reopened. So there is still an enormous backlog of products waiting to be shipped and just waiting for parts whether it's in the auto sector or any other consumer product sector. There's quite a big backlog. So we're still waiting for that to correct. I thought it would have been corrected a little bit sooner than what it appears. And that's why we're taking a relatively conservative approach to our forecast for the first quarter because we really can't predict when that's going to catch up to some extent. But I would say overall, our customers feel pretty good about where they are and about the full year, if we may have a mild recession, we hopefully have a soft landing, those sorts of things. And hopefully, the Fed backs off a little bit on the interest rate increases. Those are all, I think, important to our success in '23, and we'll just have to wait and see what happens. But overall, I think when you really compare it to pre-COVID, we're still in a pretty healthy position.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thank you.\nThomas Hassfurther: Next question please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're well. Mark, one more on the conversion delay. When did you arrive at that decision, and why -- you mentioned you're postponing the second phase by year. Why a year as opposed to, I don't know, six months, nine months, 15 months or just indefinitely and whenever demand gets better, we'll do it as opposed to we're planning to do it a year from now.\nMark Kowlzan: Adam, if demand picked up next month and all of a sudden, we needed the tons, we could pull the plug on that project, and we could do it in the spring time if we wanted to. That's the luxury that we have. We have all the equipment in our hands sitting in the warehouse at the mill. We have all the engineering done. So when we need the tons, we will do that project, and that's the benefit that we have there. So there's no secret formula. There's no magic in terms of what's driving this decision except the marketplace and our customers. And as Tom mentioned a few minutes ago, we grow with our customers' demands, and we're in a good place to do that, but also being mindful of our uses of cash and our capital spending, there's no need to spend the remaining portion of that capital on a project that's not earning any return currently as opposed to perhaps another use of that cash this year.\nThomas Hassfurther: Adam, this is Tom. Let me -- Adam, this is Tom. Let me just add something here real quick because I think this is really important, and we've been very, very consistent about this. We're not a company that builds it and hope they will come. Hope is not our strategy, has never been our strategy. Our strategies are built around our customers and what they see and what they need. So that's never going to change and we see the reality of the marketplace out there. And as we've said many times, there's not a huge open market, the export markets are under some duress right now around the world. There's not an immediate place to go to with these tons. And so we're going to be flexible and adapt to whatever the market conditions are. And our customers appreciate the fact that we will always be there for them, and we'll be prepared, and we're ahead of the curve.\nMark Kowlzan: Adam, what Tom just said and this plays into what we've always done, our competitors typically would have done one big project, got the entire project done at one time and had all of this capacity and had all of this complexity to deal with. We determined two years ago; we would do this project in phases. And if you go back decades, go back 20 years, we've always done our projects in multi phases. Now there's reasons for that. Besides capital effectiveness and uses of cash and prudent management of our cash, there's also risk mitigation and then growing with our customers' needs. And so it all plays into our historical behavior on how we go about projects and how we grow our business.\nAdam Josephson: Yes. That makes perfect sense, Mark. Tom, just back to the box demand issue. So your -- you said you're running about 6% above 2019 -- 1Q '19 levels on a per day basis. So it sounds like demand is not at particularly depressed levels for you. So when you talk about per day shipments, expecting those to be flattish sequentially, is there a lot of destocking in there that you can see? Or do you think that that's a reasonably \"normalized\" level of demand for you if you get my drift?\nThomas Hassfurther: That's the million-dollar question right there. Let me tell you. I'd like to be able to predict that perfectly. Obviously, I can't. As I said, I said that's we're taking a pretty conservative approach in the first quarter to our projections because we really don't know when this destocking is going to end. I think we're clearly past the midpoint in that. I know that for a fact, and I can feel that. But to what extent it goes further, I really can't tell you, but I think even with this conservative approach, my point about comparing to 2019 was, it's still pretty solid compared to 2019, just to get us all calibrated as to where we are.\nAdam Josephson: Right. And just to be clear, when you talk to your customers, you don't have a firm sense of whether they've done 90% of whatever destocking they're going to do or 70%, it's just not clear.\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, I think some of -- when we talk to specific customers, I mean, we get kind of a mixed bag is what we get. Some have completely -- some are completely destocked and others still have significant inventories and significant issues. And even on their side, they've got a lot of product of their own sitting there in warehouses that was prepared for a COVID environment, and now we're post COVID, and it's a different environment. So they're making their adjustments as well. And I did mention the supply chain issues that a lot of them are still dealing with.\nAdam Josephson: Yes, I appreciate that. And just one last one for me on the wood cost issue. Can you help me with what magnitude of declines you're seeing sequentially in wood costs? I appreciate that it's regional. So it varies by the mill. But overall, what you're seeing, how much is transport related? How much is weather related, just any -- the percentage decline you're experiencing? Any -- if you can flesh that out because it's not the most transparent of issues for us.\nRobert Mundy: Adam, this is Bob. What we said in our release and in our prepared remarks is we were talking about wood prices, not necessarily wood cost. Wood cost sequentially is fairly flat because typically, as you go into the much colder months, your wood yields and so forth aren't as good. So you see some usage going the other way. But the pricing improvement that we're seeing is, it is -- it was a bit drier than normal. The weather cooperated at least as far as wood supply goes over the last few months. So we're in a good place with our inventories and the price of that wood. And demand, quite frankly, there's a lot -- there has been downtime when the industry, as everyone knows, so demands and that helps you with price. So wood typically does not jump around a lot, and it's -- but I do think overall for the year, we think it will be -- should be down slightly on a price basis and maybe costs fairly flat for the full year.\nAdam Josephson: Got it. Thanks so much, Bob.\nRobert Mundy: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gab Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nGabrial Hajde: Tom, Bob, good morning. I just had one on capital allocation. And I know that you reserve the right to spend is warranted in terms of returns and things like that. But you made the comment that you've come out of a couple of years of elevated spend. This year's CapEx is $475 million. Is it appropriate for us to sort of think about, I don't know, $450 million to $500 million in CapEx as normalized. And then on the capital allocation side, Mark, you also said, \"Hey, we want to take a balanced approach. But I can't help but look at history when you guys have been aggressive buyers of your shares. It seemed to be opportune and give you a nice return. So can you just talk a little bit about how you internally talk -- think about returns on capital as it relates to projects versus share repurchases?\nMark Kowlzan: First of all, starting off for the last five or six years, we've had historically high capital spending to retool our -- primarily our box plant system and then take care of the mill big conversion projects and some of these big efficiency opportunities. But in my prepared statements, I commented that we've made clear to the investment community that this year, in particular, would be a reset down to more normalized levels of capital coming off those big highs, and so as we look at this year, we're coming down probably $350 million off of last year's $824 million capital spend. And so as we get into the $400 million area, I think for the next couple of years, that's going to be the range we're into. We've got some work to finish up in the box plants. We've got some big opportunities. We're finishing this year as an example. And then when we finish up Jackson, that will be one piece. It's not an extraordinarily large amount of capital, but it will finish up. But I think we're in a very comfortable period of time going forward now that we will be able to maintain our assets in very good condition. We'll be able to continue to take care of customer growth opportunities with capital installations on converting pieces of equipment. We have obviously the capacity in our mill system to supply that growth in a very, very cost-effective manner. So I think, again, the new capital trend going forward is significantly lower than it has been, which bodes well again for or what we do with the cash and how we deploy cash to provide return to our shareholders. And then in terms of how we look at returns on investment, we've always had probably the highest hurdle rate in the industry in terms of what we set internally as our target of acceptable returns for projects. Now some of these projects, obviously, you're growing with customers, but you're growing with valuable, high profitable added box business. But again, I'm not going to give you the return targets we set, but you can assume, and we've always said this, that we set some very high hurdle rates on our expectations on $1 spent on what we expect for that return. And that reflects itself in the return on invested capital number. It's not only the highest in the industry, but in manufacturing industrial sector alone, it ranks amongst the highest. Does that help you?\nGabrial Hajde: It does. It absolutely does. And then maybe the low-hanging fruit just to make sure we kind of have math calibrated right. If I extrapolate out the comment that you guys made it seems to imply maybe 16 million square feet for the first quarter or down 4% to 5% or so on a year-over-year basis. I'm assuming that whatever your experience has been thus far in January, went into that calculation, and it's the best estimate in terms of backlogs and what you have line of fight to.\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes. That's a fair assumption, Gabe.\nGabrial Hajde: Thank you. Good luck.\nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cleve Rueckert from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nCleveland Rueckert: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of follow-ups for me. I wanted to just ask more specifically on the work that you're doing at Jackson. I'm wondering, does that change PCA's capability and product offering at all? In other words, are there new market opportunities from that project? Or is it more just about optimizing your existing book of business?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, I'll let Tom take care of that.\nThomas Hassfurther: Cleve, what it does is it enhances some of our proprietary capabilities. That's how I would put it. And we need that, quite frankly. So that's the big short-term objective. And then obviously, we talked about the longer-term objective in Phase 2 being that ability to grow with our customers.\nCleveland Rueckert: Okay. That makes sense. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups, inventories, you talked about them a couple of times. I just explicitly like where are inventories relative to where you would like them versus your plan in containerboard.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, we never give absolute numbers. Again, we dropped down 60-some-odd thousand tons from the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. We're going to build, again, some extra inventory in January, February period to get ready for the outages at the DeRidder, Louisiana mill and the Counce, Tennessee mill. It's not an extraordinary amount of inventory. It's just a little bit of insurance cushion here for making sure that we take care of the box plants. But I think I will say it this way. What we ended the year 2022 with, we're in a good comfortable range of where we need to be now going forward with what we're seeing in the marketplace demand and our capabilities now. So this lower inventory certainly meets the current requirements. But with just a little bit extra build to get us through these big outages. Annual outages are always an uncertainty. You never know what could happen. Obviously, we're very good at what we do, but we always plan to try to mitigate some risks and the risk mitigation comes in a little bit of an insurance policy with some extra inventory on hand to make sure the box plants are well taken care of and our outside customers.\nCleveland Rueckert: Right. I think that makes a lot of sense. And that's very clear. And then I know you said that the number one machine is down at Jackson is idled temporarily. I mean, are you expecting to take any other economic downtime in Q1? Or is it really more about maintenance in the first quarter?\nMark Kowlzan: I'll let you know in April, what we did.\nCleveland Rueckert: Okay. Good luck guys. Thanks very much.\nMark Kowlzan: All right. Next question. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups, Mark or Tom, the second phase of the Jackson conversion that you're postponing from spring, maybe until next year or beyond, sorry if I missed this, is there a capacity number that you would kind of associate with that second phase or any kind of finer point you can put on that?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, I'll go by historically what we said in the last two years. The ultimate project at Jackson would on paper, get us a 2,000 ton a day containerboard machine. It would be one of the largest machines in the Western Hemisphere in terms of productivity and if you could understand and appreciate our efficiencies, it will not only be one of the largest, most productive virgin kraft linerboard machines in the Western Hemisphere, but it will be one of the lowest cost machines. And so I said we started up last week. We're in that 1,300 ton a day rate right now. We're obviously -- we'll probably push the machine and see what we -- like having a new toy. We're going to see what it will do for us over the next month or two. What are the limitations and making sure we haven't missed anything from a process point of view. And if we missed anything, then we have ample time to correct it over the course of the months ahead of us. But ultimately, the final phase will give us the extra drying and the speed on the paper machine to take us from let's just say we could run 1,500 tons a day right now with the machine we have. the last phase of work gets us that extra 500 tons a day, just to help you with some math.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just another quick question. You talked about the fiber flexibility projects. And with those done, where does that put your fiber mix or your ability to maybe flex from Virgin to OCC? And then just maybe a related question. I mean, I think historically, you've talked about the customer preference and the benefits of kraft liner, it seems like the price spread between kraft liner and recycled has kind of moved up a bit or moved out a bit. Are your customers -- do you see any specific trend in terms of increased demand for recycled or vice versa? Or just kind of how is that dynamic playing out? And what do your capabilities look like now to move between the two.\nMark Kowlzan: I'll answer part of that, and I'll let Tom answer part of that. We talked about some of these fiber flexibility projects. The biggest ones at the Wallula Mill, we over a 2.5-year period, we added a big OCC plant out there and then did completely rebuild the woodyard and improved our chip handling, chip screening and fiber yield capability in the woodyard but now Wallula has the ultimate flexibility to push OCC at very high rates if the pricing and availability is there. And then we just finished up the big OCC project at Jackson in conjunction with the rest of the work at the mill. And so Jackson, Counce, DeRidder, Wallula in terms of our linerboard mills primarily linerboard, even though DeRidder and Jackson and Wallula can make medium, but they have incredible opportunity to flex the amount of OCC, DLK that goes into the furnish depending on pricing and opportunities to take advantage of various fiber sources. And so I think if you did the math, and I'm not -- I don't have this right now, Bob might have this, but we're probably still around 20% in total -- of our total makeup of what would be OCC, DLK and virgin fiber. But we have now improved significantly by mill, what we can use in any given day. Tom, do you want to add?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, yes. I'll just add, Anthony, from a customer point of view, what do our customers want? They want the same thing we want, and that is performance. And one of our advantages being primarily virgin is that we have a lot more opportunity to hit the performance numbers at particular basis weights that I think give us a distinct advantage so that we can take advantage of all this fiber flexibility that we have, and we can also minimize some chemical use and some other things in that process. So that's really how we view our -- what our output from our mills is performance-based, and I mentioned some proprietary products that we have, and those are all based around performance.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Dunigan from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Ng: Hey, guys. It's actually Phil. I guess a quick question. Good morning, Tom. Great results in a tough backdrop. I guess my first question is normal cadence of prices moving higher with -- on the container wood side, we kind of have a good feel for how that kind of flows through your P&L. Does that dynamic from a timing perspective accelerate when prices fall, and in this current environment, have you seen more business actually put up off for bid lately?\nThomas Hassfurther: The answer to that is no, that does not accelerate when prices fall. In fact, it probably is the other way around. And our feedback from our customers is that they're not -- they haven't been anticipating it and they're not -- they're interested in being aligned long term. This is not a short-term play or anything like that. So we haven't seen any uptick in bids or anything like that either.\nPhilip Ng: That's really encouraging. And it's great to see you guys take such a disciplined approach in terms of running your mills. Tom, I think you were talking about the macro, there's a lot unknown right now. Let's say -- let's assume it's more of a soft-landing backdrop. There's a decent amount of capacity coming on in the next 12 months. How do you kind of see that playing out for the industry? And then more importantly, how do you kind of see PCA position in navigating through that backdrop?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, number one is the capacity adds that are coming on really have very little impact for us. And I think you have to look back historically and see what happened in the past when there's been adds of capacity that have come on. I think about the Verso mill up in Jay, Maine when they converted a machine to virgin kraft. That did not succeed. That mill is not even open anymore. Midwest Paper was another one that had -- it's -- as we've said a long, long time, the open market is very small in the U.S. And so those that add, they're going to have to look outside the United States for the most part. This is a very, very integrated market, the open market that does exist is under long-term contracts, typically or certain relationships like we have with our outside market buyers. So it's -- that has very little impact in my opinion. So when you hear us say we're running to demand and demand is what it is. And just to produce additional board for the sake of producing it, is basically like a death wish and it doesn't do you any good. So I hope that gives you a little flavor for where we're coming from.\nPhilip Ng: That's great color. Really appreciate it.\nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nKyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to boxes at demand. And just wondering if you can give us a little bit more details on what you're seeing by end market in that business. Any end markets that are really still working to the destocking and a bit weaker that we should really monitor here versus other end markets that have gone through this impact already?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, the only thing I could say about some of these end markets, obviously, there anything anybody in durables got a big, big jump during those COVID years and they've come down dramatically. Consumers only need so much of some durable goods. And so that, therefore, that's come down quite significantly. The other thing that has impacted us is in the ag business, Florida is an example with the two hurricanes. I mean, have wiped out some seasonal crops, the Pacific Northwest has had a lot of difficulty. You've got droughts in some other places. So the ag business took a pretty big hit this year, but that will definitely bounce back and that, and that should bounce back in pretty good shape. Other than that, across all of our segments and sectors, there's all sorts of puts and takes and some are in better shape than others, and that's just -- that's kind of the normal seasonal activity that takes place anyway.\nKyle White: Got it. And then you're fairly active in share repurchases this past quarter. Can you just talk about your thought process there? And should we expect you to continue to be active throughout 2023, given your healthy balance sheet and maybe just how you weigh those decisions versus any potential acquisitions?\nMark Kowlzan: Again, we'll be opportunistic as we've always been looking at these opportunities, whether it's a great acquisition came along and it made sense to us. We have the ability and the flexibility to take advantage of that type of use of cash. Same thing with share repurchase and dividends will continue to be something we keep in front of us and look at how do we provide the best return for our shareholders and also at the same time, be in a position to take care of our customer needs. So again, as I said in my prepared comments, as we go forward, we're in a great position to maintain the flexibility with our uses of cash and maintain a very strong balance sheet. And so none of that's changed. It's just part of our norm every day.\nKyle White: Sounds good. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. I think we might have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Our final question today will come from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: When he asked about the cadence of how price adjustments flow through the P&L. And I think you suggested that it was not faster on the way down than it is on the way up. So I guess that kind of begs the question. So of the $50 that has already been reflected by PPW, is a significant share of that anticipated to already be showing up in the box prices in the first quarter? Or is a meaningful portion of that yet to come in the second quarter if we were just to assume prices were in PPW flat from here?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, Mark, as you can well imagine, I mean, the $50 has just come, has come in increments, I mean, may or may not hit a rate at which the price would change based on the contracts. All these contracts are very different and very different timing mechanisms. So that's why I said it's -- there's no -- you can't say that it's going to go down faster than it went up or vice versa. I mean it's just; it is what it is. And as these things cycle in, they'll cycle in uniquely, we've got some customers who have even asked us just to hold off at the moment because they're not confident of what may be taking place in reality. So we'll just have to -- I mean, as I said, it just -- it factors in and meters in a little differently than I'd say on the way up just because of the small incremental moves that take place.\nMark Weintraub: Is there any color you can help us with in terms of the proportion based on what you're seeing now, you would think would show up in the first quarter versus what might slide into the second, recognizing situations can change.\nThomas Hassfurther: I'll let Bob handle that.\nRobert Mundy: Mark, it's Bob. So I would use sort of -- as Tom was indicating, based on how these things flow through and there's obviously different timing mechanisms and so forth. But however, I'd say roughly one-thirds or so you would see in the first and then two-thirds of what's happened so far showing up in the second quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thanks very much.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Mark. Jamie, I think that concludes our questions.\nOperator: Sir, that does conclude today's Q&A session. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time and look forward to talking with you with Tom and Bob and I in the April call. Take care. Have a good day. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Thomas Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.19 per share above the fourth quarter of 2021 and flat compared to the third quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.01 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and down $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022. Corrugated product shipments were down 8.7% per work day and down 10.2% in total with one less workday compared to last year's fourth quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 131,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter and 38,000 tons below the third quarter of 2022. The lower demand in our Packaging segment was driven by several items. The inventory correction in both boxes and our customers' product has been more prolonged than what we originally anticipated at the start. Inflationary pressures on the consumers have also added to the problem by reducing the consumers discretionary spending capabilities. In addition, consumer behavior changed very quickly as we exited the extreme COVID period, resulting in more of a preference towards travel, entertainment and experience versus that of tangible goods. Containerboard and box demand continues to be negatively impacted from the deterioration in U.S. and global economic conditions, rising interest rates and a cooler housing market. As we move from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we estimate the rate of shipments per day to be fairly similar as we expect many of these conditions to continue. However, there are four additional shipping days in the first quarter, so total actual shipments will be higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. In spite of the numerous issues currently impacting demand, we continue to perform at levels above pre-COVID and anticipate our first quarter shipments to exceed first quarter 2019 shipments by approximately 6% on a per day basis. Now I'll turn it back to Mark. Yes. Well, our mix was solid again, George. Of course, we don't -- with 18,000-plus customers spread across a lot of different industries, it was a relatively strong mix, and we were pleased with that. And I would just -- Yes, go ahead. Yes, yes, I think so. And Mark will talk a little bit more about the cost side. But I think we're also seeing some big benefits from all the investments that we've made, especially in our box plants over the past number of years. And so from a cost basis, we were incredibly good and performed very well. Mark, this is Tom. I'll handle that. I mean, keep in mind that we've always said that our customers drive what we do and especially in the box plants, they drive our capital investments. So we grow with them, and we adapt to whatever they need and what they're looking at, and we try to align ourselves with customers that are going to grow going forward, whether they're small or large. So I think that all of that kind of comes together. And our objectives are not only from a cost standpoint, but to satisfy those customers and puts us in a good position, I think, to take advantage of whatever the market opportunities present. Well, I'll give you an example. Our customers are continually having to change to be successful in the marketplace. And if you look at the retail market, as an example, it's very different today than what it was even five years ago. And during COVID, a lot of things occurred, especially inside the big box stores as an example. How do we get the customer back in there? What are they buying? What are they looking for? How do I promote my products and things like that. So there's been a lot of changes, and we assist a lot of our customers in helping make those changes and keeping track of what those trends are. Okay. Let me tackle a couple of these at a time. I think, first of all, let's see if we can help get ourselves calibrated here properly. We're coming out of COVID now, which had a tremendous amount of government stimulus pumped into a market which created, in my opinion, quite a bubble in terms of demand. If you look back historically and you look at box demand historically, it was always pretty level at that 1% to 2% range per year. And all of a sudden, we're jumping up into now double digits and some other things during the COVID years. So that's why I drew the correlation with what happened in -- how we compare now to 2019 and being 6% or maybe slightly above 6% compared to 2019 being up, clearly, some of the errors come out of that bubble, but not all by any means. So it's still a quite healthy demand, in my opinion, when you compare it to pre-COVID. And relative to the inventory correction. Yes, there was a huge inventory correction, and that's still continuing to some extent, as a combination of two things. Still, the supply chain is a big issue for our customers. And as you know, China just recently reopened. So there is still an enormous backlog of products waiting to be shipped and just waiting for parts whether it's in the auto sector or any other consumer product sector. There's quite a big backlog. So we're still waiting for that to correct. I thought it would have been corrected a little bit sooner than what it appears. And that's why we're taking a relatively conservative approach to our forecast for the first quarter because we really can't predict when that's going to catch up to some extent. But I would say overall, our customers feel pretty good about where they are and about the full year, if we may have a mild recession, we hopefully have a soft landing, those sorts of things. And hopefully, the Fed backs off a little bit on the interest rate increases. Those are all, I think, important to our success in '23, and we'll just have to wait and see what happens. But overall, I think when you really compare it to pre-COVID, we're still in a pretty healthy position. Next question please. Adam, this is Tom. Let me -- Adam, this is Tom. Let me just add something here real quick because I think this is really important, and we've been very, very consistent about this. We're not a company that builds it and hope they will come. Hope is not our strategy, has never been our strategy. Our strategies are built around our customers and what they see and what they need. So that's never going to change and we see the reality of the marketplace out there. And as we've said many times, there's not a huge open market, the export markets are under some duress right now around the world. There's not an immediate place to go to with these tons. And so we're going to be flexible and adapt to whatever the market conditions are. And our customers appreciate the fact that we will always be there for them, and we'll be prepared, and we're ahead of the curve. That's the million-dollar question right there. Let me tell you. I'd like to be able to predict that perfectly. Obviously, I can't. As I said, I said that's we're taking a pretty conservative approach in the first quarter to our projections because we really don't know when this destocking is going to end. I think we're clearly past the midpoint in that. I know that for a fact, and I can feel that. But to what extent it goes further, I really can't tell you, but I think even with this conservative approach, my point about comparing to 2019 was, it's still pretty solid compared to 2019, just to get us all calibrated as to where we are. Well, I think some of -- when we talk to specific customers, I mean, we get kind of a mixed bag is what we get. Some have completely -- some are completely destocked and others still have significant inventories and significant issues. And even on their side, they've got a lot of product of their own sitting there in warehouses that was prepared for a COVID environment, and now we're post COVID, and it's a different environment. So they're making their adjustments as well. And I did mention the supply chain issues that a lot of them are still dealing with. Yes. That's a fair assumption, Gabe. Okay. Thank you. Next question please. Cleve, what it does is it enhances some of our proprietary capabilities. That's how I would put it. And we need that, quite frankly. So that's the big short-term objective. And then obviously, we talked about the longer-term objective in Phase 2 being that ability to grow with our customers. Yes, yes. I'll just add, Anthony, from a customer point of view, what do our customers want? They want the same thing we want, and that is performance. And one of our advantages being primarily virgin is that we have a lot more opportunity to hit the performance numbers at particular basis weights that I think give us a distinct advantage so that we can take advantage of all this fiber flexibility that we have, and we can also minimize some chemical use and some other things in that process. So that's really how we view our -- what our output from our mills is performance-based, and I mentioned some proprietary products that we have, and those are all based around performance. Thank you. Next question. The answer to that is no, that does not accelerate when prices fall. In fact, it probably is the other way around. And our feedback from our customers is that they're not -- they haven't been anticipating it and they're not -- they're interested in being aligned long term. This is not a short-term play or anything like that. So we haven't seen any uptick in bids or anything like that either.

The other thing that has impacted us is in the ag business, Florida is an example with the two hurricanes. I mean, have wiped out some seasonal crops, the Pacific Northwest has had a lot of difficulty. You've got droughts in some other places. So the ag business took a pretty big hit this year, but that will definitely bounce back and that, and that should bounce back in pretty good shape. Other than that, across all of our segments and sectors, there's all sorts of puts and takes and some are in better shape than others, and that's just -- that's kind of the normal seasonal activity that takes place anyway. Well, Mark, as you can well imagine, I mean, the $50 has just come, has come in increments, I mean, may or may not hit a rate at which the price would change based on the contracts. All these contracts are very different and very different timing mechanisms. So that's why I said it's -- there's no -- you can't say that it's going to go down faster than it went up or vice versa. I mean it's just; it is what it is. And as these things cycle in, they'll cycle in uniquely, we've got some customers who have even asked us just to hold off at the moment because they're not confident of what may be taking place in reality. So we'll just have to -- I mean, as I said, it just -- it factors in and meters in a little differently than I'd say on the way up just because of the small incremental moves that take place. I'll let Bob handle that."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'm going to be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2022 net income of $212 million or $2.31 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2022 net income was $215 million or $2.35 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 net income of $262 million or $2.76 per share. Fourth quarter net income -- fourth quarter net sales were $1.98 billion in 2022 and $2.04 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $409 million in 2022 and $463 million in 2021. Excluding special items, we also reported full year 2022 earnings of $1.04 billion or $11.14 per share compared to 2021 earnings of $894 million or $9.39 per share. Net sales were $8.5 billion in 2022 and $7.7 billion in 2021. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2022 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 net income included special items primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. Details of all the special items for the year 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.41 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2022 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lower volumes in our Packaging segment $1.14 and Paper segment $0.02. We also had higher operating costs of $0.48, primarily from inflation on energy, chemicals, labor and benefits, supplies, repair materials and services and other indirect and fixed costs. Freight and logistics expenses were unfavorable $0.13 along with higher depreciation expense, $0.09, higher converting costs, $0.06 and higher scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.01. These items were partially offset by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment of $1.18 and Packaging segment -- and Paper segment rather of $0.21. A lower share count resulting from share repurchases $0.08; lower interest expense, $0.04 and a lower tax rate, $0.01. Results were $0.13 above the fourth quarter guidance of $2.22 per share, primarily due to higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower freight and logistics expenses, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases and a lower tax rate. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $392 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $461 million and sales of $1.9 billion or a 24.5% margin. For the full year 2022, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding the special items, was $1.8 billion with sales of $7.8 billion or a 23.8% margin compared to full year 2021 EBITDA of $1.7 billion with sales of $7.1 billion or a 23.9% margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was below expectations for the quarter, causing us to run our containerboard system to these lower demand levels. Our employees did a very good job with their cost management and process optimization efforts at these lower production rates to offset the negative volume impact. Total economic-related downtime for the fourth quarter was approximately 231,000 tons. The scheduled maintenance outage and conversion work at our Jackson, Alabama mill was completed successfully during the fourth quarter, and we restarted the mill earlier this month after being down as a result of the lower demand. The number three machine achieved its first phase design capacity and is producing a very high-quality virgin linerboard. However, based on current containerboard demand levels, we decided to move the second phase of the conversion work from this spring to next year in 2024. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business. Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $39 million with sales of $154 million or a 25.7% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 EBITDA of $26 million on sales of $143 million or an 18.4% margin. For the full year 2022, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items, was $132 million with sales of $622 million or 21.3% margin compared to the full year 2021 EBITDA of $72 million with sales of $600 million or a 12% margin. Prices and mix were up 21% from last year's fourth quarter and moved 3% higher from the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. Sales volume was about 11% below last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to paper sales from the Jackson Mill's number one machine, which we included in last year's results as well as having -- we optimized our product and customer mix since that time as we transitioned away from paper volume at Jackson mill. As expected, volume was down approximately 11% versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2022 and that also included the remaining inventory from the Jackson mill. The management team and all of the employees of the Paper business have done a tremendous job over the last several quarters to optimize our inventory, product mix and cost structure in order to deliver outstanding results for 2022, and I'm confident that we can maintain this momentum through 2023. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. The hard work of our employees, along with strong relationships between us and our customers and suppliers delivered outstanding results for PCA in 2022. New annual company records were achieved for revenue, cash from operations, net income and earnings per share. And as Bob just mentioned, 91% of our net income was returned to our shareholders from dividend payments and stock repurchases. We successfully completed or substantially completed significant cost reduction and process improvement projects at our mills including a 30-megawatt steam turbine and first phase of the number three machine conversion to containerboard at the Jackson mill. This effort included fiber flexibility projects at the Wallula and Jackson Mills and many other key initiatives. We also completed numerous high return and high efficiency improvement projects in our corrugated products plants that will allow us to better optimize our entire packaging business for the future and deliver profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities for our customers and shareholders. The significant capital investments we've made during the year had complete involvement of PCA personnel from project conception, preliminary and detailed engineering, all the way through to project implementation and start-up. These projects and initiatives achieved numerous tactical and strategic benefits while improving our industry-leading return on invested capital to just under 20%. As we've discussed on these calls many times before, by the end of 2022, we would be winding down several years of significant strategic capital investments that position us very well to meet the future needs of our many customers in a very cost-effective manner. We also finalized the optimization of our paper business while delivering excellent financial results that we expect to sustain us well into the future. As economies around the world continue to deal with numerous issues and uncertainties, virtually every individual industry is being negatively impacted in some manner. At PCA, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet which provides the financial flexibility to react quickly to most situations or opportunities in the future. We will also continue our commitment of a balanced approach towards capital allocation in order to maximize our profitability and returns to our shareholders. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter in our Packaging segment, as Tom mentioned, we expect box demand on a per day basis to be similar to the fourth quarter levels, although we expect higher total volume with corrugated products plants having four additional shipping days. Prices will move lower as a result of recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices and we're assuming lower export prices as well. Paper prices should move slightly higher with sales volume fairly flat. Labor costs and certain indirect costs will increase as some containerboard mill operations were temporarily idled during the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate higher labor and benefits costs and other timing-related expenses that occurred at the beginning of a new year as well as higher prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda. However, we expect lower wood and recycled fiber prices, lower energy prices and lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses. Lastly, we expect higher interest and nonoperating pension expenses and a higher tax rate, but we will see some benefit from our recent share repurchases. Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $2.23 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions, please. Well, again, it depends on what time period you're looking at. We're living in a dynamic world right now. And if you went back to 2020, let's go back and take a look at what happened there, as the pandemic settled in, and we got into the fall of 2020, and demand picked up dramatically in that period of time, we found ourselves at, quite frankly, an unsustainably low level of inventory per our demand. And it took us the better part of 2021 to drive that inventory to a much more comfortable level. Obviously, part of that was the transportation dilemma that was taking place throughout North America between truck drivers availability and rolling stock availability with the pandemic going on. And then just the demand pressures that were in place. But through the end of 2021 into the early part of 2022, we did achieve the -- what we felt were comfortable levels of inventory to supply our system. As the year 2022 rolled on, we also anticipated certain end-of-year activities with annual outages through the year and then different marketplace conditions into the third and fourth quarter. What we saw happen, obviously, in the fourth quarter was the falloff in demand and so we were able to readjust what we didn't believe should be our new inventory targets understanding that demand was falling off faster than we had anticipated. But also, we had the capacity now with our system improvements and with the Jackson mill being completed that we had a much higher comfort level that we could supply outside sales and our own box plant needs by running to a lower level, which again was a prudent financial decision for us. Anything else, George? I'll let Tom talk about the mix question then I can talk about operations. To that point, George, in 2021, with the new organization that we put in place in 2019, and we've been doing all of these capital projects in the mills and box plants. But 2021, we worked on probably 53 of our box plants with various sized capital projects going on from big projects and -- to small projects for retooling, recapitalizing converting lines, corrugating operations, significantly improving the unit labor productivity in these facilities. Same thing in the mills we've worked for decades, and we continue to do that every day on improving the efficiencies throughout the operations. And so that was another thing. I think if you look at the cumulative benefit of what Tom just said with the projects that we put in place in the box plants, the ongoing efforts that we continue to perform in our mills, we were able to pivot during the latter part of the year. And even though we took machines down and idled the Jackson mill, we're able to really wring out some efficiencies because of how we operate day-to-day and how we understand where these opportunities are. Again, it's -- it reflects on the organization and how we look at our business 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Okay. Thanks, George. Next question please. No, the Jackson mill now is a containerboard operation. That mill, for all intents and purposes, will not make any white paper ever again. It's truly the work we just completed in terms of the scope of work that we set out has achieved everything that the first phase was supposed to. We are now running very efficiently, very effectively. We started up just the week before last, and we ran last week, and we've been producing Grade A paper converting it in our box plants, but we'll be able to take advantage now of the project's cost benefit opportunities. There's the work that was done, and we talked about this last year would help us on the input cost side of the equation with energy usage, labor-type impacts, fiber yield, and so we will see those benefits. Now it depends also on how much production we see on the big machine. We're also ramping up the machine as we speak. The machine for the last 1.5 years from when we converted it in 2021 and ran through 2022, we were producing probably 1,275 tons a day average in that range. And right now, currently, we're somewhere in that 1,300-ton a day range and just getting comfortable with all of the new equipment. Essentially, we have a new paper machine on our hands here and then the pulp mill has been significantly rebuilt and new OCC plant. So there's a lot of new infrastructure in the mill that we're getting used to running, but we're also going to look at what the opportunity is. The second phase of work that we can choose to do when the timing is right, involves 23 new additional high-pressure dryer cans, a new forset reel at the dry end of the paper machine and then a new shoe press in the press section to enhance pricing and improve the drawing. That will take place when we need the tons. So that's to be determined, but we have the luxury of deciding that when we need to decide that. But the first phase of the work has been done extremely well. We're very pleased with what we see. So now we'll take advantage of what we have in place. And as we've done for many years, we'll wring out these benefits and these efficiencies from day to day here. So I'm pretty optimistic on what we have at Jackson. The number one machine, the smaller machine is down. It's idle temporarily. It will be available if demand determines that we should run that. And so again, I think current times, we will continue to run to demand. The entire system, we also have the annual outages coming up starting next month with our DeRidder and Counce mill. So we have to think about where we need to be with inventory levels and what we have to do to supply our box plant needs. So in that regard, I think Jackson is in a good place, but a lot of opportunity there. I'm not going to talk about our competitors. We just -- we're running to demand. We'll continue to run to demand. The Jackson machine is an opportunity for us to provide low-cost, high-quality containerboard into that Southeastern region. But it also means, as you could well assume, the rest of the system will run as we need to run it. But keeping in mind what I just said that we have our big annual outages coming at our two biggest mills being DeRidder and Counce, Tennessee, so our plans were to run a little bit extra inventory build over the next couple of months to ensure that as we go through these big outages, we will supply our needs appropriately. Thanks, Mike. Next question please. Adam, if demand picked up next month and all of a sudden, we needed the tons, we could pull the plug on that project, and we could do it in the spring time if we wanted to. That's the luxury that we have. We have all the equipment in our hands sitting in the warehouse at the mill. We have all the engineering done. So when we need the tons, we will do that project, and that's the benefit that we have there. So there's no secret formula. There's no magic in terms of what's driving this decision except the marketplace and our customers. And as Tom mentioned a few minutes ago, we grow with our customers' demands, and we're in a good place to do that, but also being mindful of our uses of cash and our capital spending, there's no need to spend the remaining portion of that capital on a project that's not earning any return currently as opposed to perhaps another use of that cash this year. Adam, what Tom just said and this plays into what we've always done, our competitors typically would have done one big project, got the entire project done at one time and had all of this capacity and had all of this complexity to deal with. We determined two years ago; we would do this project in phases. And if you go back decades, go back 20 years, we've always done our projects in multi phases. Now there's reasons for that. Besides capital effectiveness and uses of cash and prudent management of our cash, there's also risk mitigation and then growing with our customers' needs. And so it all plays into our historical behavior on how we go about projects and how we grow our business. First of all, starting off for the last five or six years, we've had historically high capital spending to retool our -- primarily our box plant system and then take care of the mill big conversion projects and some of these big efficiency opportunities. But in my prepared statements, I commented that we've made clear to the investment community that this year, in particular, would be a reset down to more normalized levels of capital coming off those big highs, and so as we look at this year, we're coming down probably $350 million off of last year's $824 million capital spend. And so as we get into the $400 million area, I think for the next couple of years, that's going to be the range we're into. We've got some work to finish up in the box plants. We've got some big opportunities. We're finishing this year as an example. And then when we finish up Jackson, that will be one piece. It's not an extraordinarily large amount of capital, but it will finish up. But I think we're in a very comfortable period of time going forward now that we will be able to maintain our assets in very good condition. We'll be able to continue to take care of customer growth opportunities with capital installations on converting pieces of equipment. We have obviously the capacity in our mill system to supply that growth in a very, very cost-effective manner. So I think, again, the new capital trend going forward is significantly lower than it has been, which bodes well again for or what we do with the cash and how we deploy cash to provide return to our shareholders. And then in terms of how we look at returns on investment, we've always had probably the highest hurdle rate in the industry in terms of what we set internally as our target of acceptable returns for projects. Now some of these projects, obviously, you're growing with customers, but you're growing with valuable, high profitable added box business. But again, I'm not going to give you the return targets we set, but you can assume, and we've always said this, that we set some very high hurdle rates on our expectations on $1 spent on what we expect for that return. And that reflects itself in the return on invested capital number. It's not only the highest in the industry, but in manufacturing industrial sector alone, it ranks amongst the highest. Does that help you? Yes, I'll let Tom take care of that. Well, we never give absolute numbers. Again, we dropped down 60-some-odd thousand tons from the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter. We're going to build, again, some extra inventory in January, February period to get ready for the outages at the DeRidder, Louisiana mill and the Counce, Tennessee mill. It's not an extraordinary amount of inventory. It's just a little bit of insurance cushion here for making sure that we take care of the box plants. But I think I will say it this way. What we ended the year 2022 with, we're in a good comfortable range of where we need to be now going forward with what we're seeing in the marketplace demand and our capabilities now. So this lower inventory certainly meets the current requirements. But with just a little bit extra build to get us through these big outages. Annual outages are always an uncertainty. You never know what could happen. Obviously, we're very good at what we do, but we always plan to try to mitigate some risks and the risk mitigation comes in a little bit of an insurance policy with some extra inventory on hand to make sure the box plants are well taken care of and our outside customers. I'll let you know in April, what we did. All right. Next question. Thanks. Well, I'll go by historically what we said in the last two years. The ultimate project at Jackson would on paper, get us a 2,000 ton a day containerboard machine. It would be one of the largest machines in the Western Hemisphere in terms of productivity and if you could understand and appreciate our efficiencies, it will not only be one of the largest, most productive virgin kraft linerboard machines in the Western Hemisphere, but it will be one of the lowest cost machines. And so I said we started up last week. We're in that 1,300 ton a day rate right now. We're obviously -- we'll probably push the machine and see what we -- like having a new toy. We're going to see what it will do for us over the next month or two. What are the limitations and making sure we haven't missed anything from a process point of view. And if we missed anything, then we have ample time to correct it over the course of the months ahead of us. But ultimately, the final phase will give us the extra drying and the speed on the paper machine to take us from let's just say we could run 1,500 tons a day right now with the machine we have. the last phase of work gets us that extra 500 tons a day, just to help you with some math. I'll answer part of that, and I'll let Tom answer part of that. We talked about some of these fiber flexibility projects. The biggest ones at the Wallula Mill, we over a 2.5-year period, we added a big OCC plant out there and then did completely rebuild the woodyard and improved our chip handling, chip screening and fiber yield capability in the woodyard but now Wallula has the ultimate flexibility to push OCC at very high rates if the pricing and availability is there. And then we just finished up the big OCC project at Jackson in conjunction with the rest of the work at the mill. And so Jackson, Counce, DeRidder, Wallula in terms of our linerboard mills primarily linerboard, even though DeRidder and Jackson and Wallula can make medium, but they have incredible opportunity to flex the amount of OCC, DLK that goes into the furnish depending on pricing and opportunities to take advantage of various fiber sources. And so I think if you did the math, and I'm not -- I don't have this right now, Bob might have this, but we're probably still around 20% in total -- of our total makeup of what would be OCC, DLK and virgin fiber. But we have now improved significantly by mill, what we can use in any given day. Tom, do you want to add? Again, we'll be opportunistic as we've always been looking at these opportunities, whether it's a great acquisition came along and it made sense to us. We have the ability and the flexibility to take advantage of that type of use of cash. Same thing with share repurchase and dividends will continue to be something we keep in front of us and look at how do we provide the best return for our shareholders and also at the same time, be in a position to take care of our customer needs. So again, as I said in my prepared comments, as we go forward, we're in a great position to maintain the flexibility with our uses of cash and maintain a very strong balance sheet. And so none of that's changed. It's just part of our norm every day. Okay. I think we might have time for one more question, please. Thanks, Mark. Jamie, I think that concludes our questions. Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time and look forward to talking with you with Tom and Bob and I in the April call. Take care. Have a good day. Bye-bye."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $420 million with capital expenditures of $247 million and free cash flow of $173 million. Other cash payments during the fourth quarter included dividend payments of $116 million, cash tax payments of $56 million and net interest payments of $31 million. We also spent $380 million during the quarter to repurchase just over 3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.70 per share. That brings our total repurchases, over the last 5 quarters, to almost 5.5 million shares at an average price of $130.62 per share. Repurchases of our outstanding stock and dividend payments made during the past year, represent 63% of cash from operations or 91% of net income that was returned to shareholders in 2022. For the full year 2022, cash from operations was $1.5 billion. Capital spending was $824 million, with free cash flow of $671 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate in 2022 was 24.5%, and our final reported cash tax rate was 20%. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $475 million, and DD&A is expected to be approximately $485 million. We estimate dividend payments of $450 million and cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $53 million. Our full year interest expense in 2023 is expected to be approximately $72 million and net cash interest payments should be about $74 million. The estimate for our 2023 book effective tax rate is 25%. Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2023, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, it's expected to be in total, $0.67 per share versus $0.99 per share in 2022. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2023 is $0.11 per share in the first quarter, $0.14 in the second, $0.22 in the third and $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Adam, this is Bob. What we said in our release and in our prepared remarks is we were talking about wood prices, not necessarily wood cost. Wood cost sequentially is fairly flat because typically, as you go into the much colder months, your wood yields and so forth aren't as good. So you see some usage going the other way. But the pricing improvement that we're seeing is, it is -- it was a bit drier than normal. The weather cooperated at least as far as wood supply goes over the last few months. So we're in a good place with our inventories and the price of that wood. And demand, quite frankly, there's a lot -- there has been downtime when the industry, as everyone knows, so demands and that helps you with price. So wood typically does not jump around a lot, and it's -- but I do think overall for the year, we think it will be -- should be down slightly on a price basis and maybe costs fairly flat for the full year. Next question please. Mark, it's Bob. So I would use sort of -- as Tom was indicating, based on how these things flow through and there's obviously different timing mechanisms and so forth. But however, I'd say roughly one-thirds or so you would see in the first and then two-thirds of what's happened so far showing up in the second quarter."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Matt. Good morning and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. I\u2019m Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging Business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I\u2019ll then wrap things up and then we\u2019d be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $262 million, or $2.80 per share, excluding special items third quarter 2022 net income was $266 million, or $2.83 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2021 net income of $257 million or $2.69 per share. The third quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding the special items was $477 million in 2022 and $464 million in 2021. Third quarter net income included the special items expenses of $0.03 per share primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper to containerboard conversion related activities, details of all special items that for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.14 per share increase in third quarter 2022 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices in mix in our packaging segment of $1.60 and pay per segment $0.23 cents. Lower interest expense, $0.04, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases, $0.04, and the lower tax rate, $0.02. These items were partially offset by operating costs which were $0.70 per share higher primarily due to inflation related increases in the areas of energy, repairs, materials and supplies, chemicals, labor and benefits expenses, as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation related increases in our converting costs which were $0.04 per share higher. The negative impact of lower volume was $0.52 per share in our packaging segment, and $0.05 cents in our paper segment. Freight and logistics expenses were $0.20 above last year, and scheduled outage expenses were $0.10 higher. We also had higher depreciation expense of $0.07, and other expenses of $0.04. The results were $0.03 above the third quarter guidance of $2.80 per share primarily due to the very sound implementation processes around our previously announced price increases in the packaging and paper segments, as well as the continued benefits generated from our mills and plants through process efficiency optimization efforts and material usage initiatives. Looking at our packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter 2020 of $467 million, with sales of $1.9 billion resulted in a margin of 24.1% versus last year as EBITDA of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion and 25.5% margin. Our teams did a tremendous job of implementing our previously announced price increases. However, demand in our packaging segment was well below our expectations for the quarter. Tom will discuss this further in a moment. The containerboard mills operated in an efficient and cost-effective manner as we balanced our supply with current domestic and export demand. As part of the effort, we began the scheduled maintenance outage in the first phase of the No. 3 machine conversion to containerboard at our Jackson Alabama mill a few weeks earlier than originally planned. Total economic related downtime for the third quarter was approximately 128,000 tons. The outage and conversion work at Jackson will be completed in the fourth quarter. And we will remain committed to ramping up our internal capacity according to our customers demand requirements. Finally, although we are still experiencing historically high inflation within our operating and converting costs, our mills and plants continued to remain focused on delivering numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, and integration and optimization enhancements and capital benefit -- capital project benefits that helped minimize the impact. I'll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, we continue to get excellent realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines, domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.54 per share above the third quarter of 2021 and up $0.35 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices and mix were up $0.06 per share compared to the third quarter of 2021 and up a $1.00 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. The lower demand in our packaging segment that Mark spoke of was driven by several items, the combined impact of which resulted in our volumes being much lower than we anticipated. Corrugated product shipments were down 6% in total and per workday, compared to last year's third quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 57,000 tons below last year's third quarter and 61,000 tons below the second quarter of 2022. The ongoing inventory correction in the retail channels is larger than originally thought and significant inflation continues to negatively impact consumers purchases at both durable and non-durable goods. In addition various events and issues in 2021 and this year, including the recent hurricane in Florida, continue to have a negative effect on the agriculture and protein markets. Demand is beginning to experience headwinds from the cooler housing markets as well. These things combined with rising global interest rates, deterioration in US economic conditions, economic weakness in China and Europe. Along with China's zero tolerance COVID policy all negatively impacted domestic containerboard and box demand. As we look from the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we expect the majority of these conditions to continue. And in addition, there are four less shipping days in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Now I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Tom. Looking at the paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $33 million, with sales of $165 million or a 20% margin compared to the third quarter of 2021 EBITDA of $18 million, and sales of $150 million or a 12% margin. Prices and mix were up 21% from last year's third quarter and moved 6% higher from the second and into the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. Sales volume was about 9% below last year's third quarter primarily due to this year's scheduled outage at our International Falls mill as well as last year's third quarter that included paper sales from the Jackson mill's No. 1 machine. The outstanding efforts around implementing our latest price increase, together with optimizing the cost structure, inventory and product mix delivered excellent margins in the paper business. Now I'll turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations and free cash flows at all time quarterly records at $431 million and $251 million, respectively. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $180 million. Common stock dividends totaled $117 million, $77 million for federal and state income tax payments, pension and Other Post Employment benefit contributions of $51 million and net interest payments of $4 million. In addition, we repurchased 1,032,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $137.60 per share, for a total of $142 million. We ended the quarter with $794 million of cash including marketable securities, and our liquidity on September 30, was $1.1 billion. Lastly, our planned annual maintenance outage expense for the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $0.38 cents per share, or $0.11 cents per share higher moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter as Tom mentioned, we see most of the issues and economic conditions and higher global interest rates that impacted third quarter packaging segment demand continuing. Our box plants will have four less shipping days compared to the third quarter. And we also expect a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products as well as lower average export containerboard prices. We will run our containerboard system based on this demand outlook along with completing the Jackson, mill scheduled annual maintenance outage in the first phase of the containerboard conversion work on the No. 3 machine. In our paper segment, we will continue to implement our previously announced $60 per ton price increase on all office printing and converting grades that took effect on September 6. However, volume will be lower compared to the seasonally stronger third quarter. As Bob mentioned, scheduled annual outage expenses will be $0.11 per share higher than the third quarter. Lastly, we expect slightly higher operating costs, primarily labor and benefits expenses, along with anticipated colder weather resulting in higher energy costs. Considering all of these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.22 per share. With that we'll be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that Matt, I'd like to open up the call for questions please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Sandy Liang on behalf of George Staphos, he had a small conflict. First, can you please discuss your early 4Q booking and billing trends? And to the extent that you can share are customers continuing to destocking the supply chain? Thank you very much.\nTom Hassfurther: Sandy, this is Tom. Good morning. So far, our bookings and buildings are running about 5% below last year. The, you asked about stocking and some inventory issues. I will tell you that I think the good news is, well, first of all, we didn't predict that it would last as long as it is in terms of this inventory issue. There was obviously coming out of the pandemic retailers and other customers stocked up significantly to try to meet the record-breaking demand that they saw and wanted to o maintain that. And of course, that demand has now waned some. In addition, we find that they ordered excessive number of boxes as well to meet that kind of demand. So we are going through this period right now of pretty severe inventory adjustment. That's what we're seeing primarily in these down volume numbers. And that's going to take a while to work through the system. We thought that it was going to work through the system and about 30 or 60 days. But this looks like it's going to be probably a couple of quarters to get through this completely.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. So following up on the demand questions. Could you ballpark and I realize this is just judgment, but yours is certainly going to be as good or better than anybody else's? How much that inventory destock might have contributed to the down 6% realizing there are other factors you highlighted as well.\nTom Hassfurther: Mark, this time again, it's significant. There's no question about it. And it's the primary number. It's quite interesting that just -- as of yesterday, as a matter of fact, I mean, we had a fairly large customer at one of our plants, who sent an email in and said, I have finally run down my excessive inventory. I'm now ready to order again. So we probably lost in a lot of cases, one or two of the typical order cycles that some of these customers would go through as they went through this destocking of inventory.\nMark Weintraub: And then you mentioned you thought, where it is originally 30 to 60 days, maybe it's going to be a couple of quarters. So is that your best? Is it right to interpret that as meaning we had it in the third quarter and you're hopeful that we'll run -- we'll be done with it through the fourth quarter? Or might it go beyond there? And do you anticipate it's going to be continuing at as high level as what we saw in certainly that the latter part of that third quarter?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, obviously, I can't predict the future. But I can tell you that. I believe that when you look at our fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there are a lot of other factors going into the fourth quarter and including this destocking. So if you look at those numbers, and you think about those, you would see that the trend is probably we'll begin to work our way out of this inventory issue. But we've got some other headwinds as well, as I mentioned, especially like the ag business in the south that was impacted by the hurricane, and that those crops are either going to be delayed or in some cases lost completely. So we, I, the only -- I've never experienced this, to be honest with you in my entire career. So this severity of this building the inventories, the lead times, the box plants got to and kind of in some cases almost a panic buy boxes because they couldn't ship their products without it obviously. So it's just going to take a little while to work through this, I look back at the great recession. And it was kind of interesting there because in the Great Recession, it took a couple of quarters for the cycle to finally turn and the business to really turn up beginning it still wasn't equal to the previous year that took a few more quarters. But the first two quarters were the big jumps. So that's the only thing I've really got it to compare to. And so I think when you think about how many boxes somebody can store, or how much product they can have and get rid of, I would think that through this Christmas season, you'll see a lot of destocking take place.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks so much, everyone. Hope you're well. Tom, just one more question about that the, are you seeing it at the retail level at your customer? To your point, I just -- I wouldn't think that your customers could store would have room to store that many boxes. So I'm just a little perplexed as to where exactly that destocking is taking place and how much longer it could last for?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, let me get specific on that. Adam. I mean, what we're talking about destocking is we're talking about customers that built their own inventories of their own products, to hopefully continue to meet a demand curve, that was quite steep and quite good for them. And all of a sudden, when that demand leveled out, they're sitting on a lot of their own inventory, that coupled with the lead times that got out in boxes, they had to store more boxes as a result of those lead times. And those lead times have now come back down to a more normal level. So just be it by coming back down to a normal level you can miss a whole order cycle.\nAdam Josephson: Got it, okay. But even though they've come back to normal lead times, they're still sitting on, it seems like much too much inventory for --\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, in some cases, yes. I just told you about a big a large customer, one of our plants that is now ordering again, but they didn't order. I gave you another example, a very large account of ours, through mid-year was up about a little over 3%. And suddenly, the next month, it was down 50%. Now, this isn't lost business, this isn't anything other than just they've got --they have excessive inventory, that they're going to have to work off for a while. So we got to get through this cycle.\nAdam Josephson: Yes, no, I appreciate that. Bob, just on the guidance, can you just walk me through the implied sequential change that the $0.60 decline? I believe you said maintenance is going to be $0.11 higher sequentially so leaves another call it $0.50. Can you help me with how much is inflation? How much is lower containerboard export? How much is the Jackson conversion work, et cetera? And then within that, Bob, how much would you consider essentially onetime items, for instance, elevated maintenance relative to normal, et cetera? If you catch my drift?\nBob Mundy: Yes, Adam. I'll say as Mark mentioned in his comments, we expect to run our containerboard system similar to this -- with the same types of issues we had in the third. So when you consider that I'd say about half of that sequential movement will end up in the volume side of so in the balance of that -- the items that are probably higher versus what we would normally see going from third quarter to fourth quarter, really a couple of buckets, primarily energy for obvious reasons, and labor and benefits again, for some obvious reasons as that continues to just increase with the situation with the labor force. I'd say one other item that might be a little bit different as well is on the freight side, we certainly are seeing some improvement in the freight world right now. But when you're matching supply with demand, you're not always able to optimize your routes, and you may be shipping things more on one mode versus the other than normal or for longer distances. So that is a reason that we expect that to be up a bit going from 3Q to 4Q.\nAdam Josephson: Yes. I appreciate that. And Mark just on the buyback. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the average price of 137 was comparable to what you did in 4Q of last year. Were you doing that as demand, like before, after demand did what it did. And I'm just wondering about your thoughts about where the stock is now versus what you've been paying for buybacks in recent quarters, in light of the recent demand weakness and otherwise.\nMark Kowlzan: As we went through the third quarter, we saw an opportunity based on where the stock price was at the time that it was a good value for us to buy back. And we look at it as a conviction opportunity that we see the value there. We have the cash and took advantage of it. It is historically in line with what we did last year at this same time in the fourth quarter. And long term, I think under the circumstances, we will continue to take advantage and be opportunistic in the same manner.\nAdam Josephson: Just one last one on that. If you were to compare potential acquisitions to further buybacks, is there one, at this juncture that's looking more attractive to you than the other or not necessarily?\nMark Kowlzan: Not necessarily. Again, I think, again, we see value in terms of the stock buyback during the third quarter. And so you would have to imagine where the stock is today, we have that same type of conviction. And so we'll update you on the January earnings call on what we actually did. But I think you have to understand, if we do hit the $2.22 number that we're guiding to, we're going to have an $11 earnings year. And so it's going to be a record year for us once again. And so again, I'm going to use the term conviction, we believe strongly that there's a much higher value in the embedded in the stock valuation.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phillip Ng with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, Mark, Tom, Bob, this is John [Inaudible] on for Phil. Appreciate the color, I want to start off with your own inventory levels. I mean, they picked up sequentially ahead of the day three outages as you're planning. But obviously the demand outlook has worsened quite a bit. Can you just give us some color on how you're viewing your own internal inventory levels on the containerboard side, and is there any economic downtime baked into your guidance?\nMark Kowlzan: When we went into the third quarter, we historically, third quarter is always a robust quarter, people are getting ready for holiday activity. And so you also come out of the second quarter, which is traditionally a bigger annual outage quarter when you've taken mills down and you run your inventory down to the lower side. So you will always try to start building back up during that July-August period, which is what we did. Obviously, the demand did not materialize. So we course corrected and ran to demand. And so we will continue to do this. I think as far as inventory targets, we don't have a specific target as such, we're looking at what Tom is understanding about what the market is doing on his side of the business and what we would imagine we would need to supply that. And we will continue to run our mills in that regard to meet the demand. We got a lot of flexibility. We will be finishing up the Jackson work sometime in November. And then we will again be using the term run to our demand.\nUnidentified Analyst : Understood. I guess leading up to this quarter, you had talked about being still pretty tight on inventories. Obviously, there's of course correction, I'm sure there it's a little bit of a moving target in terms of the inventory levels. But I guess my takeaway is that you're feeling comfortable with your inventory levels. Now there isn't some big destock that you feel like you have to do yourself with the pullback on the demand side.\nMark Kowlzan: No, we're in a good place, and again, we're at a place now we can move the tons and inventories where we see we need to move. So we're in a healthy place.\nUnidentified Analyst : Great. Okay. And then just shifting over to the paper side. My expectation I thought from last quarter was that paper volumes would be about flat sequentially in the third quarter. Obviously, it came in much higher seasonally stronger quarter. Was there anything that kind of stood out on the paper side for drivers that we should expect maybe going forward?\nMark Kowlzan: No, just again it was good quarter for us. We've also right size, the business we've got International Falls, running in a manner now in terms of its split between cut size and offset converting type grades. And so we're in a good place there. We worked off the final inventory from the Jackson production that was produced last year. So we see the market is in a balanced place right now. And we're capable of supplying the nationwide demand we have.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning. Hey, we've seen a big step down in OCC over the last couple of months. And an understanding you have more of kind of a version levered system, I think you've made some investments in recent years to add flexibility there. I'm just wondering if you can remind us how much OCC, you can consume, how much you can swing into potentially to take advantage of some of these low costs. Any thoughts there?\nMark Kowlzan: I think the best way to look at it is on a percentage basis, if you think about the total capacity of our mills system would still be around at 20%, low 20% capability of fibering up our mills. And so it's whether at a point in time with pricing, you're running 15% recycled to the system, or taking advantage of opportunities on pricing availability, and ramping it up into the lower 20% recycle. I think that's how we look at it. And that's the kind of capability we have.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then there are some competitor capacity projects that maybe will come online by the end of the year or early next year. I think some of those have explicitly targeted the independent box market. You have a very high integration rate I guess, to the extent that you can, are you seeing any of that new capacity in the market? Or entering discussions, or does your integration rate kind of insulate you from that? Just any thoughts about some of these new projects and impact on the market whether you're seeing it or not?\nMark Kowlzan: I'll let Tom comment on it.\nTom Hassfurther: Anthony, we are at number one as you summarized it correctly based on our integration level. That's been a target of ours, a very high integration level. That's where we come from. What and we've said many, many times, what other people decide to do and the investments they decide to make that strictly up to them. And we've talked about what we see the independent market being or the quote, unquote, open market, and what's happened to acquisitions over the last decade or more. That's -- that market has changed quite dramatically in terms of size. So I would just say that it's really, it's, we're a little bit ambivalent to what others decide to do.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow up from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAdam Josephson: Thanks so much, everyone. Tom, I was just one more thought which is in 3Q shipments were down six and you're talking about issues, yes, in 4Q your time up, bookings and billings down about five. Can you just remind me how that compares to 2019 levels? And what you think a reasonable expectation for demand is at this juncture, relative to '19 level, there have been obviously, so many distortions at the onset of the pandemic and thereafter. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that issue?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, well, Adam we will still be quite a bit above 2019 levels. So in spite of this, and I think that a big portion of this is as I said, inventory restocking. So I haven't changed, I really haven't changed my viewpoint, even from the last call we had, in terms of that we will retain quite a bit of the gains that took place during the pandemic going forward. This isn't severe demand destruction or anything like that, obviously, inflations have taken some toll. But this is more of a couple of quarter phenomenon, I think regarding these excessive inventories.\nAdam Josephson: And what gives you confidence in that, that you would hold some of the volume you gained, post 2019, just again, given that there was this extraordinary surge with all the government stimulus, you name it, and now we're seeing the other side of that. So I guess what would give you confidence that you would hold those post 2019 gains, if you will?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, a couple things, no different from you having a discussion with me about my viewpoints, I have the same discussions with our customers about their business and about what they project going forward. And based on their forecasts, and what they see and what they expect to be doing in their business, the capital investments that are making in their businesses, et cetera. I have a high degree of confidence. The other thing that gives me some confidence is regarding the consumer themselves, consumer spending and the consumer relative to savings and other things like that is held up pretty well, in spite of this big step up in inflation. So I think some of these things, some of these phenomena we're dealing with here in the short term are going to wane, and it's going to be relatively positive going forward.\nAdam Josephson: I appreciate and just went I think you mentioned that the impact that COVID lockdowns are having, yes, COVID lockdowns in China, excuse me are having on domestic demand. Can you just talk about just give your perspective as to the impact on the US economy from what's happening in China?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, interestingly enough we set the all-time record for onshoring of manufacturing, just in the last quarter in the US. It's not talked about very much. And it's a little subtle, but certainly very impactful for our business. And I think that'll continue to be the case. I can tell you that supply chains are still a big problem. It's been -- it continues to be a problem for our customers who rely on certain parts or chips or whatever the case might be coming from China, and the continuous disruption of that supply. That's beginning to really drive more onshoring not only here in the United States, but in Mexico and other related countries that border the US, which will be much more beneficial going forward for our box business.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. Just, first of all, just a clarification, you had mentioned that outages, I think we're going to be about $0.11 higher than you had previously anticipated in the fourth quarter. Did I hear that right? What is that number kind of on a per share basis expected to be in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?\nBob Mundy: Mark, it's $0.11 going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Got it. So it was like $0.26 or so in the third quarter going to $0.37.\nBob Mundy: It was, yes, it was like 20, yes, $0.26, $0.27, yes\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Very good. And then the other question I have is, with the Jackson project, and one of the things that was also going to do was reduce your costs meaningfully? And hopefully under a certain environment that would show up in 2023. Is that dependent on demand, getting back to strong levels? Or are there ways you can run your system that benefits is going to show up regardless, do you think or, again, if it that, it'll show up? But we'll have to wait until that demand is back to stronger levels?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, you just answered your own question. When you run the mill, the way it's designed in the way we're finishing up the work that we're doing, it will be a low-cost operation for us. And so we built that capability into it, and we'll be able to take advantage of it. But as we stand by the position that we will run the entire system to demand and that means rationalizing from a nationwide point of view where we need the tons to come from.\nMark Weintraub: Okay, so basically, for the full benefit, obviously, you need demand to get stronger. That's the right conclusion.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thank you. Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to talking with you in January for the full year fourth quarter earnings event. Take care. Have a good holiday.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, we continue to get excellent realization from the implementation of our previously announced price increases across all product lines, domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.54 per share above the third quarter of 2021 and up $0.35 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices and mix were up $0.06 per share compared to the third quarter of 2021 and up a $1.00 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022.

As we look from the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we expect the majority of these conditions to continue. And in addition, there are four less shipping days in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Now I'll turn it back to Mark. Sandy, this is Tom. Good morning. So far, our bookings and buildings are running about 5% below last year. The, you asked about stocking and some inventory issues.

But this looks like it's going to be probably a couple of quarters to get through this completely. Mark, this time again, it's significant. There's no question about it. And it's the primary number. It's quite interesting that just -- as of yesterday, as a matter of fact, I mean, we had a fairly large customer at one of our plants, who sent an email in and said, I have finally run down my excessive inventory. I'm now ready to order again. So we probably lost in a lot of cases, one or two of the typical order cycles that some of these customers would go through as they went through this destocking of inventory. Well, obviously, I can't predict the future. But I can tell you that. I believe that when you look at our fourth quarter, as I mentioned, there are a lot of other factors going into the fourth quarter and including this destocking. So if you look at those numbers, and you think about those, you would see that the trend is probably we'll begin to work our way out of this inventory issue.

But the first two quarters were the big jumps. So that's the only thing I've really got it to compare to. And so I think when you think about how many boxes somebody can store, or how much product they can have and get rid of, I would think that through this Christmas season, you'll see a lot of destocking take place. Well, let me get specific on that. Adam. I mean, what we're talking about destocking is we're talking about customers that built their own inventories of their own products, to hopefully continue to meet a demand curve, that was quite steep and quite good for them. And all of a sudden, when that demand leveled out, they're sitting on a lot of their own inventory, that coupled with the lead times that got out in boxes, they had to store more boxes as a result of those lead times. And those lead times have now come back down to a more normal level. So just be it by coming back down to a normal level you can miss a whole order cycle. Yes, in some cases, yes. I just told you about a big a large customer, one of our plants that is now ordering again, but they didn't order. I gave you another example, a very large account of ours, through mid-year was up about a little over 3%. And suddenly, the next month, it was down 50%. Now, this isn't lost business, this isn't anything other than just they've got --they have excessive inventory, that they're going to have to work off for a while. So we got to get through this cycle. Anthony, we are at number one as you summarized it correctly based on our integration level. That's been a target of ours, a very high integration level. That's where we come from. What and we've said many, many times, what other people decide to do and the investments they decide to make that strictly up to them. And we've talked about what we see the independent market being or the quote, unquote, open market, and what's happened to acquisitions over the last decade or more. That's -- that market has changed quite dramatically in terms of size. So I would just say that it's really, it's, we're a little bit ambivalent to what others decide to do. Yes, well, Adam we will still be quite a bit above 2019 levels. So in spite of this, and I think that a big portion of this is as I said, inventory restocking. So I haven't changed, I really haven't changed my viewpoint, even from the last call we had, in terms of that we will retain quite a bit of the gains that took place during the pandemic going forward. This isn't severe demand destruction or anything like that, obviously, inflations have taken some toll. But this is more of a couple of quarter phenomenon, I think regarding these excessive inventories. Well, a couple things, no different from you having a discussion with me about my viewpoints, I have the same discussions with our customers about their business and about what they project going forward. And based on their forecasts, and what they see and what they expect to be doing in their business, the capital investments that are making in their businesses, et cetera. I have a high degree of confidence. The other thing that gives me some confidence is regarding the consumer themselves, consumer spending and the consumer relative to savings and other things like that is held up pretty well, in spite of this big step up in inflation. So I think some of these things, some of these phenomena we're dealing with here in the short term are going to wane, and it's going to be relatively positive going forward. Well, interestingly enough we set the all-time record for onshoring of manufacturing, just in the last quarter in the US. It's not talked about very much. And it's a little subtle, but certainly very impactful for our business. And I think that'll continue to be the case. I can tell you that supply chains are still a big problem. It's been -- it continues to be a problem for our customers who rely on certain parts or chips or whatever the case might be coming from China, and the continuous disruption of that supply. That's beginning to really drive more onshoring not only here in the United States, but in Mexico and other related countries that border the US, which will be much more beneficial going forward for our box business."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt. Good morning and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging Business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our third quarter results and then turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I'll then wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $262 million, or $2.80 per share, excluding special items third quarter 2022 net income was $266 million, or $2.83 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2021 net income of $257 million or $2.69 per share. The third quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2022 and $2.0 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding the special items was $477 million in 2022 and $464 million in 2021. Third quarter net income included the special items expenses of $0.03 per share primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper to containerboard conversion related activities, details of all special items that for the third quarter of 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.14 per share increase in third quarter 2022 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices in mix in our packaging segment of $1.60 and pay per segment $0.23 cents. Lower interest expense, $0.04, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases, $0.04, and the lower tax rate, $0.02. These items were partially offset by operating costs which were $0.70 per share higher primarily due to inflation related increases in the areas of energy, repairs, materials and supplies, chemicals, labor and benefits expenses, as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas. We also had inflation related increases in our converting costs which were $0.04 per share higher. The negative impact of lower volume was $0.52 per share in our packaging segment, and $0.05 cents in our paper segment. Freight and logistics expenses were $0.20 above last year, and scheduled outage expenses were $0.10 higher. We also had higher depreciation expense of $0.07, and other expenses of $0.04. The results were $0.03 above the third quarter guidance of $2.80 per share primarily due to the very sound implementation processes around our previously announced price increases in the packaging and paper segments, as well as the continued benefits generated from our mills and plants through process efficiency optimization efforts and material usage initiatives. Looking at our packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter 2020 of $467 million, with sales of $1.9 billion resulted in a margin of 24.1% versus last year as EBITDA of $467 million with sales of $1.8 billion and 25.5% margin. Our teams did a tremendous job of implementing our previously announced price increases. However, demand in our packaging segment was well below our expectations for the quarter. Tom will discuss this further in a moment. The containerboard mills operated in an efficient and cost-effective manner as we balanced our supply with current domestic and export demand. As part of the effort, we began the scheduled maintenance outage in the first phase of the No. 3 machine conversion to containerboard at our Jackson Alabama mill a few weeks earlier than originally planned. Total economic related downtime for the third quarter was approximately 128,000 tons. The outage and conversion work at Jackson will be completed in the fourth quarter. And we will remain committed to ramping up our internal capacity according to our customers demand requirements. Finally, although we are still experiencing historically high inflation within our operating and converting costs, our mills and plants continued to remain focused on delivering numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, and integration and optimization enhancements and capital benefit -- capital project benefits that helped minimize the impact. I'll now turn it over to Tom who will provide more details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business. Thank you, Tom. Looking at the paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $33 million, with sales of $165 million or a 20% margin compared to the third quarter of 2021 EBITDA of $18 million, and sales of $150 million or a 12% margin. Prices and mix were up 21% from last year's third quarter and moved 6% higher from the second and into the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. Sales volume was about 9% below last year's third quarter primarily due to this year's scheduled outage at our International Falls mill as well as last year's third quarter that included paper sales from the Jackson mill's No. 1 machine. The outstanding efforts around implementing our latest price increase, together with optimizing the cost structure, inventory and product mix delivered excellent margins in the paper business. Now I'll turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter as Tom mentioned, we see most of the issues and economic conditions and higher global interest rates that impacted third quarter packaging segment demand continuing. Our box plants will have four less shipping days compared to the third quarter. And we also expect a seasonally less rich mix in corrugated products as well as lower average export containerboard prices. We will run our containerboard system based on this demand outlook along with completing the Jackson, mill scheduled annual maintenance outage in the first phase of the containerboard conversion work on the No. 3 machine. In our paper segment, we will continue to implement our previously announced $60 per ton price increase on all office printing and converting grades that took effect on September 6. However, volume will be lower compared to the seasonally stronger third quarter. As Bob mentioned, scheduled annual outage expenses will be $0.11 per share higher than the third quarter. Lastly, we expect slightly higher operating costs, primarily labor and benefits expenses, along with anticipated colder weather resulting in higher energy costs. Considering all of these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings of $2.22 per share. With that we'll be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that Matt, I'd like to open up the call for questions please. As we went through the third quarter, we saw an opportunity based on where the stock price was at the time that it was a good value for us to buy back. And we look at it as a conviction opportunity that we see the value there. We have the cash and took advantage of it. It is historically in line with what we did last year at this same time in the fourth quarter. And long term, I think under the circumstances, we will continue to take advantage and be opportunistic in the same manner. Not necessarily. Again, I think, again, we see value in terms of the stock buyback during the third quarter. And so you would have to imagine where the stock is today, we have that same type of conviction. And so we'll update you on the January earnings call on what we actually did. But I think you have to understand, if we do hit the $2.22 number that we're guiding to, we're going to have an $11 earnings year. And so it's going to be a record year for us once again. And so again, I'm going to use the term conviction, we believe strongly that there's a much higher value in the embedded in the stock valuation. When we went into the third quarter, we historically, third quarter is always a robust quarter, people are getting ready for holiday activity. And so you also come out of the second quarter, which is traditionally a bigger annual outage quarter when you've taken mills down and you run your inventory down to the lower side. So you will always try to start building back up during that July-August period, which is what we did. Obviously, the demand did not materialize. So we course corrected and ran to demand. And so we will continue to do this. I think as far as inventory targets, we don't have a specific target as such, we're looking at what Tom is understanding about what the market is doing on his side of the business and what we would imagine we would need to supply that. And we will continue to run our mills in that regard to meet the demand. We got a lot of flexibility. We will be finishing up the Jackson work sometime in November. And then we will again be using the term run to our demand. No, we're in a good place, and again, we're at a place now we can move the tons and inventories where we see we need to move. So we're in a healthy place. No, just again it was good quarter for us. We've also right size, the business we've got International Falls, running in a manner now in terms of its split between cut size and offset converting type grades. And so we're in a good place there. We worked off the final inventory from the Jackson production that was produced last year. So we see the market is in a balanced place right now. And we're capable of supplying the nationwide demand we have. I think the best way to look at it is on a percentage basis, if you think about the total capacity of our mills system would still be around at 20%, low 20% capability of fibering up our mills. And so it's whether at a point in time with pricing, you're running 15% recycled to the system, or taking advantage of opportunities on pricing availability, and ramping it up into the lower 20% recycle. I think that's how we look at it. And that's the kind of capability we have. I'll let Tom comment on it. Yes, you just answered your own question. When you run the mill, the way it's designed in the way we're finishing up the work that we're doing, it will be a low-cost operation for us. And so we built that capability into it, and we'll be able to take advantage of it. But as we stand by the position that we will run the entire system to demand and that means rationalizing from a nationwide point of view where we need the tons to come from. Yes. Yes. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to talking with you in January for the full year fourth quarter earnings event. Take care. Have a good holiday."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations and free cash flows at all time quarterly records at $431 million and $251 million, respectively. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $180 million. Common stock dividends totaled $117 million, $77 million for federal and state income tax payments, pension and Other Post Employment benefit contributions of $51 million and net interest payments of $4 million. In addition, we repurchased 1,032,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $137.60 per share, for a total of $142 million. We ended the quarter with $794 million of cash including marketable securities, and our liquidity on September 30, was $1.1 billion. Lastly, our planned annual maintenance outage expense for the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $0.38 cents per share, or $0.11 cents per share higher moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yes, Adam. I'll say as Mark mentioned in his comments, we expect to run our containerboard system similar to this -- with the same types of issues we had in the third. So when you consider that I'd say about half of that sequential movement will end up in the volume side of so in the balance of that -- the items that are probably higher versus what we would normally see going from third quarter to fourth quarter, really a couple of buckets, primarily energy for obvious reasons, and labor and benefits again, for some obvious reasons as that continues to just increase with the situation with the labor force. I'd say one other item that might be a little bit different as well is on the freight side, we certainly are seeing some improvement in the freight world right now. But when you're matching supply with demand, you're not always able to optimize your routes, and you may be shipping things more on one mode versus the other than normal or for longer distances. So that is a reason that we expect that to be up a bit going from 3Q to 4Q. Mark, it's $0.11 going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. It was, yes, it was like 20, yes, $0.26, $0.27, yes"

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging Business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $301 million or $3.20 per share. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. The details of the special items for both the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied their earnings press release. Excluding special items, second quarter 2022 net income was $304 million, or $3.23 per share, compared to the second quarter 2021 net income of $207 million, or $2.17 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2.2 billion in 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding the special items, was $533 million in 2022 and $397 million in 2021. Excluding the special items, the $1.06 per share increase in second quarter of 2022 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $2.04 and volume, $0.12 in the Packaging segment, and higher prices and mix in the Paper segment of $0.18. Scheduled outage expenses were favorable by $0.08 per share. Interest expense was lower by $0.03. A lower share count resulting from 2021 repurchases was favorable by $0.03 and other items were favorable $0.03 per share. These items were partially offset by $0.95 of inflation-related operating costs, particularly with energy, fiber, chemicals, operating labor, repair labor and materials and several other indirect and fixed cost areas. Freight and logistics expenses have now moved higher for eight quarters in a row and were $0.25 per share above the second quarter of 2021. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.10 per share and depreciation expense was up $0.08 per share over last year. Volume in our Paper segment was lower by $0.06 per share compared to last year when we were still running uncoated freesheet, our number one machine, at the Jackson, Alabama mill, and our tax rate was higher by $0.01 per share. Results were $0.40 above the second quarter guidance of $2.83 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower scheduled outage expenses of $0.07 per share resulting from the postponement of the international falls outage from the second quarter to the third quarter and lower fiber and energy costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2022 of $525 million with sales of $2.1 billion, resulted in a margin of 25.4% versus last year's EBITDA of $409 million and sales of $1.7 billion or 23.8% margin. We had great execution of our previously announced price increases and demand in our Packaging segment was solid with corrugated demand about flat with last year's record second quarter, along with demand out of our containerboard mills generating new second quarter production and sales volume records. Even with record production from our mills, we still ended the quarter with weeks of containerboard inventory supply below our historical levels due to demand needs from both internal and external customers. We will be attempting to build some much needed inventory during the third quarter, ahead of the significant fourth quarter outage at the Jackson, Alabama mill for the first phase of the number three machine conversion to virgin linerboard. We're still experiencing significant inflationary headwinds in our operating costs as well as freight and logistics expenses. However, our mills and plans continue to do an outstanding job of meeting our customers' needs while delivering on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, integration and optimization enhancements and capital project benefits to maximize our returns and margins. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on the containerboard sales and our corrugating business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, total corrugated product shipments and shipments per day were essentially flat compared to last year's record second quarter, which was up 9.6% versus the previous year. Outside sales volume of containerboard was about 41,000 tons above last year's second quarter, which was our lowest outside volume quarter for 2021, but 6,000 tons below the first quarter of this year due to the lower export shipments, strong internal demand and managing through the scheduled maintenance outages at our mills. Very good implementation of our previously announced price increases, together with profitable revenue growth and mix enhancements, delivered significant value for us during the quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.89 per share above the second quarter of 2021 and up $0.76 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices were up $0.15 per share versus last year's second quarter and up slightly compared to the first quarter of 2022. As it pertains to our converting facilities, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to meet our customers' needs, help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases. Our operations improvement and capital spending strategies in the corrugated plants have been extremely successful and put us in a position to serve our customers better than ever before, even against the backdrop of unprecedented supply chain and logistical challenges. Improving the processes, technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our geographical footprint is driven by our customers' needs and improving our capabilities to grow with them. This strategy also improves our operating and converting efficiencies and delivers cost savings in several areas throughout our facilities. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items, in the second quarter was $32 million with sales of $150 million or 21% margin compared to second quarter 2021 EBITDA of $12 million and sales of $142 million or an 8.2% margin. Sales volume was about 12% below last year's second quarter when we were still producing paper on the number one machine of the Jackson, Alabama mill versus producing corrugating medium in this year's second quarter. Paper prices and mix were 19% higher than last year's second quarter and 5% above the first quarter of 2022, resulting from our previously announced paper price increases. Also, as mentioned earlier, we had to postpone the maintenance outage scheduled at the International Falls, Minnesota mill from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year due to excessive flooding in the area during the weeks prior to the outage. The outstanding efforts around implementing our latest price increase, together with optimizing the cost structure, inventory and product mix delivered excellent margins in our Paper business for this quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks, Mark. For the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $324 million and free cash flow of $135 million. Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $189 million, common stock dividends of $94 million, cash taxes of $127 million and net interest payments of $35 million. We ended the quarter with $667 million of cash on hand or $811 million, including marketable securities. Our liquidity on June 30th was $1.1 billion. Primarily due to the postponement of the International Falls scheduled outage from the second quarter to the third quarter, our scheduled outage expense will increase from $0.20 per share in the second quarter to $0.27 in the third quarter, and we are estimating $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter. This results in the total company estimated cost impact for the year totaling to $1.06 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second into the third quarter in our Packaging segment, although the majority of our previously announced price increases were recognized in the second quarter, the remaining portion will be implemented during the third quarter. In our Paper segment, we will continue implementing our previously announced price increases. And yesterday, we notified our customers of an additional $60 per ton price increase on all office printing and converting grades effective with shipments beginning September 6th. As I mentioned previously, we began the quarter with containerboard inventories below our target. So we plan to build some inventory ahead of the fourth quarter outage at the Jackson, Alabama mill when we'll begin that first phase of the number three machine conversion to virgin linerboard. With economic conditions continuing to be negatively impacted by broad-based inflation and aggressive interest rate increases, we see corrugated products growth as softening in the quarter, but demand still firm as certain end markets work through their current supply of inventory. We expect continued inflation in most all of our operating and converting costs to be primarily driven \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to be the primary driver of the third quarter results. Higher gas, purchased electricity and chemical prices, along with a very tight labor market and contractual wage increases driving labor costs higher are expected to be the key areas during the quarter. However, we also still have particularly high inflation-driven costs in repair labor and materials, pallet costs, property rents, outside services and many other indirect and fixed cost areas. Although we're beginning to see improvements in truck and driver availability as well as some moderating diesel costs, continued rail service challenges along with rail fuel surcharges that typically lag diesel fuel prices by 30 to 60 days should also result in higher freight and logistics expenses. And finally, as Bob indicated, scheduled outage costs will be $0.07 per share higher due to the International Falls mill outage that was postponed from the second to the third quarter. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $2.80 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Matt, I'd like to open the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question will come from George Staphos with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi. Thank you. Good morning everybody. Thanks for all the details, Mark, Tom and Bob. The first question I had, if you could give us a bit more color to the volume and end market trends that you're seeing. You're saying you expect growth to soften, should we take that as actually we should see lower volumes 3Q versus 3Q? How would you sort of guide us or give guardrails around that? And you mentioned some end markets working through some inventory. If you could perhaps give us some color on which end markets and which inventories are being worked down? Is it finished goods inventories for your customers at retail? Or is it their inventories of paper and perhaps boxes? And then I had a couple of quick follow-ons.\nTom Hassfurther: Hi, George. This is Tom. Let me see if I can answer that question\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, Tom. Good morning.\nTom Hassfurther: Good morning. Let me see if I can answer that question, which is going to take a little while to work through. But right now just to give you a little color on where we are, we're now billing about 2% below a year ago and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the bookings trends are starting to go up a little bit. So I think we'll be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 third quarter is going to be flattish, probably, as we said, which is maybe to down just a little bit. But we're feeling good about the amount of volume that we have and that we're basically retaining all of those gains that we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that took place during the COVID years. Right now, I think, we're going through \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we've been going through a cycle, probably the last 30 days and leading into another short-term period going forward, where our customers have excessive amounts of inventory. And this is not inventory of boxes. This is inventory of their finished products. Almost to a company, they've said that they built inventory based on the demand curve that took place during the COVID years, and that demand curve is now flattened. They're not saying that their business is going to be down, but that it's just flattening. And I think those are good \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think those are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's a good trend, quite frankly, and a good trend for our business because it was kind of fits where we were hoping to be, and that was to retain all those significant gains we had over the last couple of years. And they feel like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and they feel very confident that once they work through these inventory issues, which I think is really our short-term problem at the end of the second quarter leading into the third quarter, once they come out of that, they're going to go back to demand trends that are more equivalent to where they were last year.\nGeorge Staphos: Tom thanks for that. My two quick follow-ons and I appreciate all the color. Is there a way, Bob or Mark, to bridge 2Q to 3Q? We obviously have the outage swapping, call it, $0.07. Would it be fair to say the $0.40 in total sequential change from 2Q to 3Q that maybe volumes and the decremental margins are maybe $0.15 to $0.20, and then the higher cost that you cited are the residual in terms of getting to that $0.40? And then recognizing you don't want to give up too much color here, can you talk about what went particularly well in terms of your execution on pricing and mix such that you were better than your expectations going into the quarter? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Hey, Bob, why don't you go ahead and start that and then we can let Tom finish that.\nBob Mundy: Yes. Yes. Yes. Hi, George. Yes, you're pretty close, George. If you look at Tom's comments regarding third quarter volume and as we've indicated, we still have a little bit of a tailwind from the latest price increase that we'll work through into the third quarter. The net of that is certainly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's a positive number between those two, but it's the inflationary components. And the ones that we pointed out in the release with freight costs and logistics costs because primarily on the rail side and chemicals, starch lime, soda ash, resins, all up again this quarter. But the largest hit is that with natural gas and purchased electricity. We went up almost 30% 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q it's another like 26% higher. And then you throw in the labor, we have some contractual wage increases that are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that come through this quarter in the mills and the box plants. And then you look at supplies and materials and operating items and so forth, the suppliers we get those from they had the same issues that we're dealing with around their costs and their labor and whatnot. So, that gets priced into what we buy from them. So it becomes a rather large number that offsets that positive that we see between the price tailwind and the volume that Tom spoke to.\nGeorge Staphos: Understood. And on just pricing execution, what went better?\nBob Mundy: Yes, I think, everything across the board went very well into price execution and continues to be so. I would add in addition, when it comes to volume, when you go through a price increase, I mean, you have to be prepared to perhaps lose some volume as a result of raising prices or improving your mix or whatever the case might be, which, as we've said in the past, we've always been prepared to do, and we'll continue to be prepared to do. George, you also asked about end markets and I'll give you just a little color on where we see some of those end markets. And simply put e-commerce is still going up, not at the growth rate it was, but it's still growing. Food and beverage has held its own and has been very steady. The biggest decline has come in the durables area, which you would have expected if volumes jumped let's say 15% to 30% over the last couple of years in some of these durable markets all of those customers expected their volumes to go back down to 2019 levels and to moderate. So that's no big surprise to us. But certainly an end market that is not going to retain all of the gains and the rate going forward. But it's one of the smaller segments for us.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you very much, guys. Good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Roxland with Truist. Please go ahead.\nMike Roxland: Thanks very much. Congrats guys on a very good quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks Mike.\nMike Roxland: Just wanted to follow-up Tom, on the comment you just made in response to George's question in terms of durables and one of the smaller one of the smallest segments for PKG. Is there any way to quantify like what percentage durables represents of PKG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall mix?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, we don't really get into that kind of detail, Mike. But just trust me it's one of the smaller segments.\nMike Roxland: Got it. And then just following up on the mix, can you talk about some of the mix improvement that helped drive the beat during the quarter? And Tom you've also mentioned maybe being prepared to walk away from some business. So how much of the mix improvement was PKG being proactive and walking away from business versus customers just being upset with power prices?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think we've got an ability because of the setup of our box plants and sheet plants to make sure that we ran the business where it needed to be run. We took advantage of our entire system as opposed to just trying to focus on few plants. And listen, it was very difficult in that high demand curve business that we've been dealing with over the last few years with an incredibly tight labor market to satisfy all of our customers' needs. So, we had to be very focused on making sure that we were doing all the right things and that at the same time we were getting paid appropriately for all those things that we were doing. And so all in all, Mike, I mean, it's a very complex set of logistical challenges, scheduling challenges, et cetera, that we had to implement and the team did an incredibly good job, making sure that we were as efficient as we possibly could, satisfied all the customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs and captured those opportunities that presented themselves.\nMike Roxland: Got it. And just one final question, in the press release, you called out lower fiber and energy costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what those initiatives are and whether they have been fully deployed through the mill and the box plant system, or if there is more runway for you to deploy them to drive costs lower? And I asked this question, realizing that you've really focused on optimizing your box plant system the last few years, following the optimization of your mills. And so I'm just wondering if there is any further runway ahead in your box plants.\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. Mike, this is something we do every day. And again, over the last five years, half a dozen years we've accelerated that process across the box plants, along with the mills. And so it's something that goes on every day, seven days a week, and we'll continue to go on and we will always find opportunities to make improvements with. That's one of the advantages of the organization. We have about 150 engineers and technology specialists that are dedicated to assisting with the mills and the box plants seven days a week. And so that will be an opportunity that continues to go on forever.\nMike Roxland: Got it. Thanks very much and good luck in the quarter.\nTom Hassfurther: All right. Thanks Mike. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.\nMark Wilde: Thanks. Good morning, Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nMark Wilde: Mark, could we just start by maybe getting an update on sort of cost and cadence of the GenX and conversion efforts, because you're I think going to be doing some work in the fourth quarter you mentioned, and I think there is more work scheduled for next year. So if you could just help us with how the expenses on that are going to run and then sort of how the capacity at the mill will actually ramp up over time?\nMark Kowlzan: Just to call out the whole project, we were talking approximately $450 million of capital for not just the machine, but all of the associated work at the mill. And we're still on track with that. And I think this year we're probably somewhere in that $160 million type spend, next year we'll wrap that up with about a $100 million of final spend on the spring outage that we've got scheduled or the final phase that will take care of that machine. But we're on track for the original call out of about $450 million of total capital at the mill.\nMark Wilde: And Mark, when that's done, what will the capacity of the mill be? And what's, just in general terms, what will the fiber mix look like between kind of virgin fiber and recycle?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, we've talked that machine theoretically would have a capacity of just rounded off 700,000 ton a year type of capability under the optimal grade mix. As far as the fiber mix as we've done with all of our mills, we've built in a lot of flexibility, we're getting ready to start up the new OCC plant this summer. And so that will give us a tremendous opportunity to flex the virgin fiber to the OCC and some DLK. So I don't want to get into the specifics, it will be very similar to what we do at DeRidder and Counce mills as far as being able to move that fiber mix around and take advantage of the marketplace.\nMark Wilde: Okay. And then Tom Hassfurther, I just wanted to talk a little bit about the converting business. I'm just curious from a broad perspective the impact on kind of productivity and cost that you see from kind of new corrugators and new converting equipment going in across the industry very similar to, I think, what you've just done up at Washington, because it seems like just an unprecedented period to me when I look across the industry broadly at the amount of new investment that's going on in converting, I don't know whether you would agree with that statement.\nTom Hassfurther: I would say that it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I wouldn't call it unprecedented necessarily Mark, I think, it seems like that probably because there are so few suppliers to this industry anymore and the lead times are so far out that you are seeing announcements that are coming about, but if you really take into account, when they are actually going to go into place, you are looking at 18 to 24 months from now.\nMark Wilde: And in terms of like, just when you think about things like the project out in Washington recently, what kind of productivity or cost benefits do you get from kind of these new or bigger corrugators and also the new downstream converting equipment?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, there is no question. I mean, this equipment provides better cost structures and provides more productivity. But again, I think you have to use it based on, and you have to think of it based on what your mix is, the type of customers you're dealing with and what your expectations are to be able to service those customers. So, they are incredibly expensive investments and it's something that, I think, from PCA, I can only speak from PCA standpoint. From PCA's point of view we've consistently reinvested in our box plants and our mills obviously. We've hardly missed a beat in any given year, no matter what's happening in the economy. And I think that's served us very well. But again, our investments are all based on what our customers are telling us they need, and what they want us to do and how they need us to provide the products to them in a timely manner.\nMark Wilde: Yes, okay. And last one, does it lead you to kind of pivot away at all from the use of sheet plants that you've had over time? I mean, I think that you've probably had a higher proportion of specialty sheet plants than the rest of the industry.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, I don't see any \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for us, we're not pivoting away from that by any means. In fact, again, we're adjusting to the customer needs even in those facilities so that we can satisfy a complete array of customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 demands as opposed to just a segment of their demands. So, it's still a very critical piece to how we go-to-market.\nMark Wilde: Okay.\nMark Kowlzan: Mark thinking about the investments we've made in these sheet plants we've not only increased their productivity, but their efficiencies and their capability in terms of what Tom was talking about to satisfy whatever the customer needs and do it in a very efficient, effective fashion.\nMark Wilde: Okay. Very good. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, trying to understand the increase in sequential cost, et cetera, third quarter versus second quarter, would that be similar in magnitude to what your expectations, similar in magnitude to what you experienced first quarter to second quarter? Is there any slowing you are seeing or any specificity there you could provide?\nBob Mundy: Yes. Yes, Mark, this is Bob. It's extremely similar to what we saw first quarter to second quarter. But actually on the energy side is where it's significantly higher, because like I said, cost went up in the first to second about almost 30% and now there is another 26 plus percent on top of that. So, that's probably the main difference from a cost perspective, but freight and so on and so forth are very similar. So you are not too far off.\nMark Weintraub: And historic because if I look back last 10 years, I think, all about one year you were up third quarter versus second quarter, obviously you typically don't have this experience of as big, an increase in cost second to third quarter. Are you and would you typically be getting some seasonal tailwinds, which you are sort of not factoring in this time around?\nBob Mundy: Well, one thing that's different is and that Tom mentioned it's on the volume side, because I think, typically if you go back that many years since you referred to, you wouldn't see volume flat to down a little bit. So that's a big difference 2Q to 3Q versus what we've done historically, I would say that stands out and the inflation of course, that you mentioned.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. That makes sense. All right, thanks very much.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAdam Josephson: Mark, Bob, Tom, good morning. Thanks always.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning. \nAdam Josephson: Good morning, Mark. Tom would you mind just walking me through, so on the last call, I think, you said your bookings in April up about 3.5, for the quarter your shipments were about flat. Can you just help me with your shipment trends or your booking trends, however, whatever you want to talk about? How they trended throughout the quarter and then into July? And then I think, George asked about July and you mentioned that, I think, billings are down couple percent, but that bookings are starting to turn up. So can you just help us understand the distinction between all these terms that you are throwing out to measure demand?\nTom Hassfurther: Sure. Sure Adam, no problem. In April I believe I told you on the call that we were up about 3.5% at the time, and we ended up just shy of that at 3.2% in April. As you went through the quarter, we started to see that decline and we started to hear from those customers, as I mentioned earlier, that they were in a pretty severe inventory situation and they needed to work off some of that inventory. So, we've been seeing that and have been experiencing that over the last 90 days or so. And I think it looks as if maybe perhaps we're coming to the end of that. It's almost in timing and in concert with what some of the customers had to say. However, as you can probably well imagine are we in a recession, are we not in a recession, all these other things that are being talked about from an economic point of view, it leads us to take a fairly conservative approach to forecasting at this point in time. And in addition, we just, we came out of a price increase during that period of time as well. And we were implementing that price increase. And in some cases, as I mentioned earlier, you've got to be prepared to put some business on the line to do so. So, the price is obviously a bigger lever for us and that was an important part of our strategy to go execute. So, that's the best I can tell you is to the forecast going forward and where we are and where we've come through.\nAdam Josephson: No, I appreciate that. And just to clarify the July, so if billings are down 2% month-to-date, can you help clarify that bookings comment that you made that more recently they have started to go up, just help us understand the distinction between the two and why they might seemingly be moving in different directions in July?\nBob Mundy: Well, I think, billings are from what happened already, bookings are looking out a few weeks to even a month in some cases. And so, you start to determine what's the correlation there. And I'm talking about on a volume point of view not on a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously not revenue point of view.\nAdam Josephson: Right.\nBob Mundy: So, that's the big difference is I'm just looking at what happened already to date from the billings point of view. Yet from a booking standpoint, I can see a trend that's looking out another two and four weeks and that's getting better than the trend we saw in the billing.\nAdam Josephson: Right. And so, based on that, I think, you said in response to one of George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other question that for the quarter, you are thinking flattish to down a bit year-on-year in terms of shipments, is that right?\nBob Mundy: Right, correct.\nAdam Josephson: Got it. Okay. And also, Tom, just on the inflation, you mentioned freight, I think, having gone up for eight consecutive quarters and all other manner of costs have been highly inflationary for the last two years, for reasons we're all well aware of, if in fact we do go into a recession, what is your view as to what will happen to that inflation? How embedded do you think certain aspects of that inflation are versus energy and other costs that may be less so?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think, a lot of that inflation is embedded and I will tell you why, because we took this big jump in volume and the economy took a big jump over these last few years, unexpected, especially in our business. And I don't see us going down to 2019 levels or even 2020 levels anytime soon. I think we'll maintain a lot of that. And given what we've had and what we're dealing with right now, especially like you take labor shortages, as an example, labor shortages are impacting us. They are impacting the freight business, they are impacting every business. And I don't see that subsiding anytime soon, either. So, I think a lot of those \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think a lot of those costs are embedded now. Energy on the other hand, and some of these others, they can change on a dime, given demand and things like that. But some of these other things certainly in the box business are quite embedded.\nAdam Josephson: I appreciate that. And Tom or Bob, just 3Q to 4Q, just to make sure we're on the same page as you, can you help me with historically cost are up sequentially 3Q to 4Q as weather gets cold, or et cetera, use more energy, et cetera. And then you have the Jackson project going on. Is there anything we should keep in mind in terms of how much higher one could reasonably expect cost to be 3Q to 4Q seasonally or otherwise related to the Jackson project?\nBob Mundy: Well, yes, certainly for the Jackson project that you'll see a lot of that is in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that scheduled outage sequential movement, Adam that goes, I think I said $0.44 in the fourth quarter. So that's a lot of where you'll see the Jackson impact. But as far as the other costs, I mean, yes, we don't expect them to be the, move sequentially. Like we were seeing, we expect to see between the second and third and frankly energy actually usually gets a little better because the temperatures are a little bit milder in the fourth quarter versus the hot summer months. So you expect some of your usages and some of your chemicals and energy and some of the wood yields and things like that. It typically gets a little better actually. So we would hope that you don't see near as large a sequential movement in cost going from 3Q to 4Q, but we'll see.\nAdam Josephson: Got it. Thanks very much, Bob.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phillip Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPhillip Ng: Hey guys.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nPhillip Ng: I guess, good morning. With the macro backdrop a little less clear at this point, any change in how you're thinking about phasing in Jackson ramp and how much confidence do you have those tons being sold out effectively when it comes online next year?\nMark Kowlzan: Again, I think it's important that we get this, this phase in the fall done because it's not just a matter of incremental tons, but it's significant cost reduction opportunity. And so along with next the sec \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the final phase that will occur next year, that's another step in not only the productivity on the machine, but another big piece of the cost improvement that comes out of the mill. So it's imperative that we get these projects done and then going through the future as we always do, we will run to demand and we'll optimize our system.\nPhillip Ng: Okay. And appreciating once it's fully ramped up from a cost profile, it's much enhanced, but remind us how that all plays out just because you're taking the mill down or it's probably not operating as ideally throughout next year. But from an EBITDA contribution, should we expect it to be up year-over-year? Flat down, just want to make sure what direction we're thinking about at least the right way?\nMark Kowlzan: 2023 over 2022?\nPhillip Ng: Yes.\nMark Kowlzan: You'd expect it to be up.\nPhillip Ng: Okay. All right. That's what I thought I just wanted.\nMark Kowlzan: Just for the very reason I said that not only the productivity incremental tons, but the significant cost reduction.\nPhillip Ng: Okay, super. And if I may, energy standpoint, appreciating gas prices are really kind of perked up and that's hard to predict. Can you remind us how much gas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 nat gas and electricity you consume from a cost standpoint, any hedges that you have in place?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. We do hedge. We don't hedge all of our volume. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's a certain percentage of our volume and we constantly are monitoring that. Sometimes we're on the right side of that and sometimes you're not, and, but we've always done that and we'll continue to do that going forward. But we supply about 70 plus percent of our internal needs for energy. When the balance of that that other 30%, I'd say 80% 85% of that is tied to gas; so that's the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's how it works.\nPhillip Ng: Got it. And just one last quick one for me perhaps question for Tom. Appreciating that getting that mix gains in 2Q was very complicated, a lot of moving pieces. Should we expect those gains to be pretty sticky throughout the rest of the year?\nTom Hassfurther: Give me the second half of that. I didn't quite hear you, Phillip.\nPhillip Ng: Should we expect the mix gains that you saw in 2Q to be pretty sticky in the back half this year?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. I think the mix change will be. I mean, our mix always changes a little bit in the third and fourth quarter, again. And I think you'll see some of that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of the same issues, as I said going into the third quarter especially around inventory that's what's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's what's creating some of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of our issues at the moment, but I think that'll smooth out. So I think that'll be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that'll be a plus force in the third and fourth quarters.\nPhillip Ng: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nGabe Hajde: Mark, Tom, Bob good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nBob Mundy: Good morning.\nGabe Hajde: I had a question about kind of tightness in the freight markets. I guess both trucking and rail that that you guys have referenced. So are you still inclined kind of to carry more inventory or safety stock to maintain acceptable customer service levels? And are you running behind this level or what you've historically have considered kind of comfortable safety stock, if you will? And then maybe, I don't know, I came up with you guys kind of process call it 14,000 tons per day across your whole system, kind of quantify the inventory levels that you would expect to build in the third quarter going into this, this big out outage at Jackson?\nMark Kowlzan: Let me answer it this way, if you think about the last two years, we've been struggling to achieve an adequate level of containable inventory through the system. We hope to get through this third quarter and actually pre-build some inventory to get ready for this big outage at Jackson in the fourth quarter. But again for the last two years it's been a struggle. Now that being said even though there is some incremental improvement in truck and driver availability, the rail side of the equation it remains very inefficient. And so it behooves us to try to build more inventory. We don't have the luxury of the short transportation times that we saw prior to 2020 and so you have to think that in terms of a lead time of getting a ton of container board from a mill to a box plant remains a challenge. And so essentially that has not improved significantly from where we were. And so we continue to be very mindful of what we do with our inventories and making sure that we have adequate container board stock to satisfy what the box plants need to take care of their customers. Tom, Bob, you want to add anything?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I would just add Mark that that's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that those are the efficiency. Those are part of the efficiencies that you alluded to when you talked about the Jackson conversion. In addition to the Jackson mill operating, it also creates opportunities for us to be more cost efficient in terms of the way we're operating from a transportation point of view, and also making sure that we have the correct stock in each of our facilities to service our customers.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And I'll try to take a stab one more time, not interested in quantifying the level of inventory you're trying to build.\nMark Kowlzan: As far as inventory level, we don't generally talk about absolute numbers but if you think about the outage in November it's approximately a 30-day outage that's probably 35,000 or 40,000 tons of impact that we'll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that we'll have to deal with. So it would behoove us to try to accomplish a significant build this quarter to get through the fourth quarter. So if you think about where we've been and again not achieving the adequate levels, I think if you think about 30,000, 40,000 tons of incremental containable inventory, 3Q going into 4Q would be a desired goal. Bob, you want to add anything?\nBob Mundy: No.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. Thanks for that Mark. And then my second question and I suspect you'll probably defer, but when I look across your converting system, you do have a pretty good representation in the Northeast. But your mill system is kind of Southeast and obviously Michigan, Tennessee, et cetera. Any thought process or I don't want to say guidance, but view for potentially having a mill in the Northeast in the three to five-year planning horizon?\nMark Kowlzan: No comment.\nTom Hassfurther: Thanks. Have a good one.\nGabe Hajde: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Take care. Next question, please.\nOperator:  Our next question will come from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please give ahead.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you. There's a lot of literature about the consumer backing out of big brands because they're strapped and buying generic brands. Does it matter to PKG which brands the consumer buys because you sell the containerboard anyway?\nMark Kowlzan: Generally speaking it doesn't matter. Certainly to some individual customers, it might matter but as far as we're concerned we've got 16,000 plus customers we're dealing with from very large to, to quite small. Somewhere along the way those \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that customer base is supplying those brands you mentioned. So for us and the broad base of customers we have it doesn't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it doesn't really impact us that much.\nJohn Tumazos: Thank you for the good results.\nMark Kowlzan: You're welcome.\nTom Hassfurther: You're welcome.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Cleve Rueckert with UBS. Please go ahead.\nCleve Rueckert: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, everybody, and nice job in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nCleve Rueckert: Very strong performance, it's impressive. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the comments about maybe being willing to give up some business while you're trying to push a price hike through. I'm just curious if you're seeing competition increasing in the domestic U.S. market for your containerboard products?\nMark Kowlzan: We generally don't. We generally don't talk much about competition or some of the things that are going on in the market. Let's just put it this way that the market, as you can tell the volume and the market place in total remains very strong. In spite of the fact that I mentioned a little bit of pullback, because if you look at the gains we had over the last few years that put tremendous strains on the entire industry. So the entire industry is remains in my opinion very healthy and that's pretty much all I'm going to comment on.\nCleve Rueckert: Okay. Yes, that's fair enough. I just wanted to follow-up. And then we were talking about sort of the order book and bookings and Adam, asked several questions about it. I'm just curious about what the lead time is on your order book and those bookings? Not necessarily for containerboard to box plants, but for use of inbox customers. How much visibility do you have there and maybe how is that different versus what you saw in Q1 and in Q2?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, our lead times have come down, which is actually good because they got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they got way too far out as a result of the demand that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that we suddenly incurred along with the labor shortages we had the freight issues, other supply chain issues, as you can well imagine. So lead times \u00e2\u0080\u0093 lead times had gotten out there quite a ways. We typically \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we typically operate on very short lead times based on whatever our customer's needs and we're not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we're not back to that yet. We're working to get back there, but again we are still dealing with a lot of those same issues labor related, freight related, whatever it might happen to be we're still dealing with a lot of those issues and those are still impacting those lead times, but they have come down.\nCleve Rueckert: Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. That makes sense. And maybe, finally, sorry if I missed it earlier, but could you just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 could you tell us again what the incremental capacity that you expect to get out of Jackson is, and when that comes on. Is that going to be sort of in the middle of next year after the spring outage? I'm just wondering what the ramp-up schedule is there?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, if you think about the production currently on the machine, the work that's being done in November will provide an opportunity, but it's probably about 125,000 tons of a year of extra opportunity on a machine from its current situation.\nCleve Rueckert: That's total once you're finished, its 125...\nMark Kowlzan: No. No, that's, that's this November's project. Again, so from where we are today and going through the project in November, we'd get about 125,000 tons of annualized opportunity on the machine. And then the final project next year you get about 140,000 tons more of productivity opportunity on the final phase, because you're talking about dryer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 additional dryer cans and drying capacity in particular.\nCleve Rueckert: Got it. Got it. And you get...\nMark Kowlzan: But keep in mind again that's significant cost reduction that goes along with that.\nCleve Rueckert: Right, right.\nMark Kowlzan: Which falls right to the bottom line.\nCleve Rueckert: Exactly. Okay. That does it for me. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. You're welcome. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKyle White: Hey, good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nKyle White: Thanks for taking the questions. Yes, good morning. I want to go back to Phil's question on energy. Just curious, has the dynamics in the energy markets this year caused you to make any changes to your energy policy and how you manage this cost. I recognize you're not as exposed to nat gas, some other producers, but curious what levers you have to manage this risk?\nMark Kowlzan: No. Again we've the box plants essentially use natural gas across the board. The mills have the advantage of burning black liquor wood waste, and minimal amount of natural gas. It would be primarily used in a lime kiln as an example. But we don't have a lot of flexibility in that regard. You're tied to natural gas in the box plants and then a certain minimal amount in the mill. So it is what it is. So you have to buy that whether you hedge a portion or all or how you manage that. But no, the balance hasn't changed and again how we manage it quite frankly is the same today as we've looked at it probably over the last 10 years.\nKyle White: Got it. And then, and I think I missed this in the prepared remarks, but did you repurchase any shares during the quarter? And just think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how are you thinking about buybacks with the recent authorization you announced at the beginning of this year, and then also given the full back and equity value since the end of last quarter?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. No, we didn't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 did not buy back any shares this recent quarter. And as far as how we look at it, the keyword is opportunistic and so amongst ourselves, we know where we would be choosing to buy at any given time and we'll just leave it at that.\nKyle White: All right. It sounds good. I'll hand it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator:  Mr. Kowlzan, I see that there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today on the call and I look forward to speaking with you in the latter part of October with the third quarter results. Have a nice day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, total corrugated product shipments and shipments per day were essentially flat compared to last year's record second quarter, which was up 9.6% versus the previous year. Outside sales volume of containerboard was about 41,000 tons above last year's second quarter, which was our lowest outside volume quarter for 2021, but 6,000 tons below the first quarter of this year due to the lower export shipments, strong internal demand and managing through the scheduled maintenance outages at our mills. Very good implementation of our previously announced price increases, together with profitable revenue growth and mix enhancements, delivered significant value for us during the quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.89 per share above the second quarter of 2021 and up $0.76 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices were up $0.15 per share versus last year's second quarter and up slightly compared to the first quarter of 2022. As it pertains to our converting facilities, I'd like to reemphasize some of what Mark was pointing out regarding the many things we do to meet our customers' needs, help offset inflation and improve our margins beyond just price increases. Our operations improvement and capital spending strategies in the corrugated plants have been extremely successful and put us in a position to serve our customers better than ever before, even against the backdrop of unprecedented supply chain and logistical challenges. Improving the processes, technology and equipment in our plants and optimizing our geographical footprint is driven by our customers' needs and improving our capabilities to grow with them. This strategy also improves our operating and converting efficiencies and delivers cost savings in several areas throughout our facilities. I'll now turn it back to Mark. Hi, George. This is Tom. Let me see if I can answer that questiona\u0302\u0080\u00a6 Good morning. Let me see if I can answer that question, which is going to take a little while to work through. But right now just to give you a little color on where we are, we're now billing about 2% below a year ago and a\u0302\u0080\u0093 but the bookings trends are starting to go up a little bit. So I think we'll be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 third quarter is going to be flattish, probably, as we said, which is maybe to down just a little bit. But we're feeling good about the amount of volume that we have and that we're basically retaining all of those gains that we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that took place during the COVID years. Right now, I think, we're going through a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we've been going through a cycle, probably the last 30 days and leading into another short-term period going forward, where our customers have excessive amounts of inventory. And this is not inventory of boxes. This is inventory of their finished products. Almost to a company, they've said that they built inventory based on the demand curve that took place during the COVID years, and that demand curve is now flattened. They're not saying that their business is going to be down, but that it's just flattening. And I think those are good a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I think those are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that's a good trend, quite frankly, and a good trend for our business because it was kind of fits where we were hoping to be, and that was to retain all those significant gains we had over the last couple of years. And they feel like a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and they feel very confident that once they work through these inventory issues, which I think is really our short-term problem at the end of the second quarter leading into the third quarter, once they come out of that, they're going to go back to demand trends that are more equivalent to where they were last year. Well, we don't really get into that kind of detail, Mike. But just trust me it's one of the smaller segments. Well, I think we've got an ability because of the setup of our box plants and sheet plants to make sure that we ran the business where it needed to be run. We took advantage of our entire system as opposed to just trying to focus on few plants. And listen, it was very difficult in that high demand curve business that we've been dealing with over the last few years with an incredibly tight labor market to satisfy all of our customers' needs. So, we had to be very focused on making sure that we were doing all the right things and that at the same time we were getting paid appropriately for all those things that we were doing. And so all in all, Mike, I mean, it's a very complex set of logistical challenges, scheduling challenges, et cetera, that we had to implement and the team did an incredibly good job, making sure that we were as efficient as we possibly could, satisfied all the customersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 needs and captured those opportunities that presented themselves. Yes. Mike, this is something we do every day. And again, over the last five years, half a dozen years we've accelerated that process across the box plants, along with the mills. And so it's something that goes on every day, seven days a week, and we'll continue to go on and we will always find opportunities to make improvements with. That's one of the advantages of the organization. We have about 150 engineers and technology specialists that are dedicated to assisting with the mills and the box plants seven days a week. And so that will be an opportunity that continues to go on forever. All right. Thanks Mike. Next question, please. I would say that it's a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I wouldn't call it unprecedented necessarily Mark, I think, it seems like that probably because there are so few suppliers to this industry anymore and the lead times are so far out that you are seeing announcements that are coming about, but if you really take into account, when they are actually going to go into place, you are looking at 18 to 24 months from now. Well, there is no question. I mean, this equipment provides better cost structures and provides more productivity. But again, I think you have to use it based on, and you have to think of it based on what your mix is, the type of customers you're dealing with and what your expectations are to be able to service those customers. So, they are incredibly expensive investments and it's something that, I think, from PCA, I can only speak from PCA standpoint. From PCA's point of view we've consistently reinvested in our box plants and our mills obviously. We've hardly missed a beat in any given year, no matter what's happening in the economy. And I think that's served us very well. But again, our investments are all based on what our customers are telling us they need, and what they want us to do and how they need us to provide the products to them in a timely manner. Sure. Sure Adam, no problem. In April I believe I told you on the call that we were up about 3.5% at the time, and we ended up just shy of that at 3.2% in April. As you went through the quarter, we started to see that decline and we started to hear from those customers, as I mentioned earlier, that they were in a pretty severe inventory situation and they needed to work off some of that inventory. So, we've been seeing that and have been experiencing that over the last 90 days or so. And I think it looks as if maybe perhaps we're coming to the end of that. It's almost in timing and in concert with what some of the customers had to say. However, as you can probably well imagine are we in a recession, are we not in a recession, all these other things that are being talked about from an economic point of view, it leads us to take a fairly conservative approach to forecasting at this point in time. And in addition, we just, we came out of a price increase during that period of time as well. And we were implementing that price increase. And in some cases, as I mentioned earlier, you've got to be prepared to put some business on the line to do so. So, the price is obviously a bigger lever for us and that was an important part of our strategy to go execute. So, that's the best I can tell you is to the forecast going forward and where we are and where we've come through. Well, I think, a lot of that inflation is embedded and I will tell you why, because we took this big jump in volume and the economy took a big jump over these last few years, unexpected, especially in our business. And I don't see us going down to 2019 levels or even 2020 levels anytime soon. I think we'll maintain a lot of that. And given what we've had and what we're dealing with right now, especially like you take labor shortages, as an example, labor shortages are impacting us. They are impacting the freight business, they are impacting every business. And I don't see that subsiding anytime soon, either. So, I think a lot of those a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I think a lot of those costs are embedded now. Energy on the other hand, and some of these others, they can change on a dime, given demand and things like that. But some of these other things certainly in the box business are quite embedded. Give me the second half of that. I didn't quite hear you, Phillip. Yes. I think the mix change will be. I mean, our mix always changes a little bit in the third and fourth quarter, again. And I think you'll see some of that a\u0302\u0080\u0093 some of the same issues, as I said going into the third quarter especially around inventory that's what's a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that's what's creating some of a\u0302\u0080\u0093 some of our issues at the moment, but I think that'll smooth out. So I think that'll be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that'll be a plus force in the third and fourth quarters. Well, I would just add Mark that that's a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that those are the efficiency. Those are part of the efficiencies that you alluded to when you talked about the Jackson conversion. In addition to the Jackson mill operating, it also creates opportunities for us to be more cost efficient in terms of the way we're operating from a transportation point of view, and also making sure that we have the correct stock in each of our facilities to service our customers. Thanks. Have a good one. You're welcome."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, the Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging Business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide more details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $301 million or $3.20 per share. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. The details of the special items for both the second quarter of 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied their earnings press release. Excluding special items, second quarter 2022 net income was $304 million, or $3.23 per share, compared to the second quarter 2021 net income of $207 million, or $2.17 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2.2 billion in 2022 and $1.9 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding the special items, was $533 million in 2022 and $397 million in 2021. Excluding the special items, the $1.06 per share increase in second quarter of 2022 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $2.04 and volume, $0.12 in the Packaging segment, and higher prices and mix in the Paper segment of $0.18. Scheduled outage expenses were favorable by $0.08 per share. Interest expense was lower by $0.03. A lower share count resulting from 2021 repurchases was favorable by $0.03 and other items were favorable $0.03 per share. These items were partially offset by $0.95 of inflation-related operating costs, particularly with energy, fiber, chemicals, operating labor, repair labor and materials and several other indirect and fixed cost areas. Freight and logistics expenses have now moved higher for eight quarters in a row and were $0.25 per share above the second quarter of 2021. We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were higher by $0.10 per share and depreciation expense was up $0.08 per share over last year. Volume in our Paper segment was lower by $0.06 per share compared to last year when we were still running uncoated freesheet, our number one machine, at the Jackson, Alabama mill, and our tax rate was higher by $0.01 per share. Results were $0.40 above the second quarter guidance of $2.83 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower scheduled outage expenses of $0.07 per share resulting from the postponement of the international falls outage from the second quarter to the third quarter and lower fiber and energy costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2022 of $525 million with sales of $2.1 billion, resulted in a margin of 25.4% versus last year's EBITDA of $409 million and sales of $1.7 billion or 23.8% margin. We had great execution of our previously announced price increases and demand in our Packaging segment was solid with corrugated demand about flat with last year's record second quarter, along with demand out of our containerboard mills generating new second quarter production and sales volume records. Even with record production from our mills, we still ended the quarter with weeks of containerboard inventory supply below our historical levels due to demand needs from both internal and external customers. We will be attempting to build some much needed inventory during the third quarter, ahead of the significant fourth quarter outage at the Jackson, Alabama mill for the first phase of the number three machine conversion to virgin linerboard. We're still experiencing significant inflationary headwinds in our operating costs as well as freight and logistics expenses. However, our mills and plans continue to do an outstanding job of meeting our customers' needs while delivering on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, integration and optimization enhancements and capital project benefits to maximize our returns and margins. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on the containerboard sales and our corrugating business. Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items, in the second quarter was $32 million with sales of $150 million or 21% margin compared to second quarter 2021 EBITDA of $12 million and sales of $142 million or an 8.2% margin. Sales volume was about 12% below last year's second quarter when we were still producing paper on the number one machine of the Jackson, Alabama mill versus producing corrugating medium in this year's second quarter. Paper prices and mix were 19% higher than last year's second quarter and 5% above the first quarter of 2022, resulting from our previously announced paper price increases. Also, as mentioned earlier, we had to postpone the maintenance outage scheduled at the International Falls, Minnesota mill from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year due to excessive flooding in the area during the weeks prior to the outage. The outstanding efforts around implementing our latest price increase, together with optimizing the cost structure, inventory and product mix delivered excellent margins in our Paper business for this quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second into the third quarter in our Packaging segment, although the majority of our previously announced price increases were recognized in the second quarter, the remaining portion will be implemented during the third quarter. In our Paper segment, we will continue implementing our previously announced price increases. And yesterday, we notified our customers of an additional $60 per ton price increase on all office printing and converting grades effective with shipments beginning September 6th. As I mentioned previously, we began the quarter with containerboard inventories below our target. So we plan to build some inventory ahead of the fourth quarter outage at the Jackson, Alabama mill when we'll begin that first phase of the number three machine conversion to virgin linerboard. With economic conditions continuing to be negatively impacted by broad-based inflation and aggressive interest rate increases, we see corrugated products growth as softening in the quarter, but demand still firm as certain end markets work through their current supply of inventory. We expect continued inflation in most all of our operating and converting costs to be primarily driven a\u0302\u0080\u0093 to be the primary driver of the third quarter results. Higher gas, purchased electricity and chemical prices, along with a very tight labor market and contractual wage increases driving labor costs higher are expected to be the key areas during the quarter. However, we also still have particularly high inflation-driven costs in repair labor and materials, pallet costs, property rents, outside services and many other indirect and fixed cost areas. Although we're beginning to see improvements in truck and driver availability as well as some moderating diesel costs, continued rail service challenges along with rail fuel surcharges that typically lag diesel fuel prices by 30 to 60 days should also result in higher freight and logistics expenses. And finally, as Bob indicated, scheduled outage costs will be $0.07 per share higher due to the International Falls mill outage that was postponed from the second to the third quarter. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $2.80 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions. But I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Matt, I'd like to open the call for questions, please. Yes. Hey, Bob, why don't you go ahead and start that and then we can let Tom finish that. Thank you. Next question, please. Thanks Mike. Good morning. Just to call out the whole project, we were talking approximately $450 million of capital for not just the machine, but all of the associated work at the mill. And we're still on track with that. And I think this year we're probably somewhere in that $160 million type spend, next year we'll wrap that up with about a $100 million of final spend on the spring outage that we've got scheduled or the final phase that will take care of that machine. But we're on track for the original call out of about $450 million of total capital at the mill. Well, again, we've talked that machine theoretically would have a capacity of just rounded off 700,000 ton a year type of capability under the optimal grade mix. As far as the fiber mix as we've done with all of our mills, we've built in a lot of flexibility, we're getting ready to start up the new OCC plant this summer. And so that will give us a tremendous opportunity to flex the virgin fiber to the OCC and some DLK. So I don't want to get into the specifics, it will be very similar to what we do at DeRidder and Counce mills as far as being able to move that fiber mix around and take advantage of the marketplace. Well, I don't see any a\u0302\u0080\u0093 for us, we're not pivoting away from that by any means. In fact, again, we're adjusting to the customer needs even in those facilities so that we can satisfy a complete array of customersa\u0302\u0080\u0099 demands as opposed to just a segment of their demands. So, it's still a very critical piece to how we go-to-market. Mark thinking about the investments we've made in these sheet plants we've not only increased their productivity, but their efficiencies and their capability in terms of what Tom was talking about to satisfy whatever the customer needs and do it in a very efficient, effective fashion. Thank you. Next question, please. Okay. Next question, please. Good morning. Thank you. Next question. Good morning. Again, I think it's important that we get this, this phase in the fall done because it's not just a matter of incremental tons, but it's significant cost reduction opportunity. And so along with next the sec a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the final phase that will occur next year, that's another step in not only the productivity on the machine, but another big piece of the cost improvement that comes out of the mill. So it's imperative that we get these projects done and then going through the future as we always do, we will run to demand and we'll optimize our system. 2023 over 2022? You'd expect it to be up. Just for the very reason I said that not only the productivity incremental tons, but the significant cost reduction. Yes. We do hedge. We don't hedge all of our volume. We a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it's a certain percentage of our volume and we constantly are monitoring that. Sometimes we're on the right side of that and sometimes you're not, and, but we've always done that and we'll continue to do that going forward. But we supply about 70 plus percent of our internal needs for energy. When the balance of that that other 30%, I'd say 80% 85% of that is tied to gas; so that's the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that's how it works. Okay, next question, please. Good morning. Let me answer it this way, if you think about the last two years, we've been struggling to achieve an adequate level of containable inventory through the system. We hope to get through this third quarter and actually pre-build some inventory to get ready for this big outage at Jackson in the fourth quarter. But again for the last two years it's been a struggle. Now that being said even though there is some incremental improvement in truck and driver availability, the rail side of the equation it remains very inefficient. And so it behooves us to try to build more inventory. We don't have the luxury of the short transportation times that we saw prior to 2020 and so you have to think that in terms of a lead time of getting a ton of container board from a mill to a box plant remains a challenge. And so essentially that has not improved significantly from where we were. And so we continue to be very mindful of what we do with our inventories and making sure that we have adequate container board stock to satisfy what the box plants need to take care of their customers. Tom, Bob, you want to add anything? As far as inventory level, we don't generally talk about absolute numbers but if you think about the outage in November it's approximately a 30-day outage that's probably 35,000 or 40,000 tons of impact that we'll a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that we'll have to deal with. So it would behoove us to try to accomplish a significant build this quarter to get through the fourth quarter. So if you think about where we've been and again not achieving the adequate levels, I think if you think about 30,000, 40,000 tons of incremental containable inventory, 3Q going into 4Q would be a desired goal. Bob, you want to add anything? No comment. Take care. Next question, please. Generally speaking it doesn't matter. Certainly to some individual customers, it might matter but as far as we're concerned we've got 16,000 plus customers we're dealing with from very large to, to quite small. Somewhere along the way those a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that customer base is supplying those brands you mentioned. So for us and the broad base of customers we have it doesn't a\u0302\u0080\u0093 it doesn't really impact us that much. You're welcome. Next question please. Good morning. We generally don't. We generally don't talk much about competition or some of the things that are going on in the market. Let's just put it this way that the market, as you can tell the volume and the market place in total remains very strong. In spite of the fact that I mentioned a little bit of pullback, because if you look at the gains we had over the last few years that put tremendous strains on the entire industry. So the entire industry is remains in my opinion very healthy and that's pretty much all I'm going to comment on. Well, our lead times have come down, which is actually good because they got a\u0302\u0080\u0093 they got way too far out as a result of the demand that a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that we suddenly incurred along with the labor shortages we had the freight issues, other supply chain issues, as you can well imagine. So lead times a\u0302\u0080\u0093 lead times had gotten out there quite a ways. We typically a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we typically operate on very short lead times based on whatever our customer's needs and we're not a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we're not back to that yet. We're working to get back there, but again we are still dealing with a lot of those same issues labor related, freight related, whatever it might happen to be we're still dealing with a lot of those issues and those are still impacting those lead times, but they have come down. Well, if you think about the production currently on the machine, the work that's being done in November will provide an opportunity, but it's probably about 125,000 tons of a year of extra opportunity on a machine from its current situation. No. No, that's, that's this November's project. Again, so from where we are today and going through the project in November, we'd get about 125,000 tons of annualized opportunity on the machine. And then the final project next year you get about 140,000 tons more of productivity opportunity on the final phase, because you're talking about dryer a\u0302\u0080\u0093 additional dryer cans and drying capacity in particular. But keep in mind again that's significant cost reduction that goes along with that. Which falls right to the bottom line. Okay. You're welcome. Next question, please. Good morning. No. Again we've the box plants essentially use natural gas across the board. The mills have the advantage of burning black liquor wood waste, and minimal amount of natural gas. It would be primarily used in a lime kiln as an example. But we don't have a lot of flexibility in that regard. You're tied to natural gas in the box plants and then a certain minimal amount in the mill. So it is what it is. So you have to buy that whether you hedge a portion or all or how you manage that. But no, the balance hasn't changed and again how we manage it quite frankly is the same today as we've looked at it probably over the last 10 years. Yes. No, we didn't a\u0302\u0080\u0093 did not buy back any shares this recent quarter. And as far as how we look at it, the keyword is opportunistic and so amongst ourselves, we know where we would be choosing to buy at any given time and we'll just leave it at that. Okay. Next question, please. Yes. I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today on the call and I look forward to speaking with you in the latter part of October with the third quarter results. Have a nice day."

            "name": "Bob Mundy",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. For the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $324 million and free cash flow of $135 million. Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $189 million, common stock dividends of $94 million, cash taxes of $127 million and net interest payments of $35 million. We ended the quarter with $667 million of cash on hand or $811 million, including marketable securities. Our liquidity on June 30th was $1.1 billion. Primarily due to the postponement of the International Falls scheduled outage from the second quarter to the third quarter, our scheduled outage expense will increase from $0.20 per share in the second quarter to $0.27 in the third quarter, and we are estimating $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter. This results in the total company estimated cost impact for the year totaling to $1.06 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hi, George. Yes, you're pretty close, George. If you look at Tom's comments regarding third quarter volume and as we've indicated, we still have a little bit of a tailwind from the latest price increase that we'll work through into the third quarter. The net of that is certainly a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that's a positive number between those two, but it's the inflationary components. And the ones that we pointed out in the release with freight costs and logistics costs because primarily on the rail side and chemicals, starch lime, soda ash, resins, all up again this quarter. But the largest hit is that with natural gas and purchased electricity. We went up almost 30% 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q it's another like 26% higher. And then you throw in the labor, we have some contractual wage increases that are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that come through this quarter in the mills and the box plants. And then you look at supplies and materials and operating items and so forth, the suppliers we get those from they had the same issues that we're dealing with around their costs and their labor and whatnot. So, that gets priced into what we buy from them. So it becomes a rather large number that offsets that positive that we see between the price tailwind and the volume that Tom spoke to. Yes, I think, everything across the board went very well into price execution and continues to be so. I would add in addition, when it comes to volume, when you go through a price increase, I mean, you have to be prepared to perhaps lose some volume as a result of raising prices or improving your mix or whatever the case might be, which, as we've said in the past, we've always been prepared to do, and we'll continue to be prepared to do. George, you also asked about end markets and I'll give you just a little color on where we see some of those end markets. And simply put e-commerce is still going up, not at the growth rate it was, but it's still growing. Food and beverage has held its own and has been very steady. The biggest decline has come in the durables area, which you would have expected if volumes jumped let's say 15% to 30% over the last couple of years in some of these durable markets all of those customers expected their volumes to go back down to 2019 levels and to moderate. So that's no big surprise to us. But certainly an end market that is not going to retain all of the gains and the rate going forward. But it's one of the smaller segments for us. Yes. Yes, Mark, this is Bob. It's extremely similar to what we saw first quarter to second quarter. But actually on the energy side is where it's significantly higher, because like I said, cost went up in the first to second about almost 30% and now there is another 26 plus percent on top of that. So, that's probably the main difference from a cost perspective, but freight and so on and so forth are very similar. So you are not too far off. Well, one thing that's different is and that Tom mentioned it's on the volume side, because I think, typically if you go back that many years since you referred to, you wouldn't see volume flat to down a little bit. So that's a big difference 2Q to 3Q versus what we've done historically, I would say that stands out and the inflation of course, that you mentioned. Well, I think, billings are from what happened already, bookings are looking out a few weeks to even a month in some cases. And so, you start to determine what's the correlation there. And I'm talking about on a volume point of view not on a a\u0302\u0080\u0093 obviously not revenue point of view. So, that's the big difference is I'm just looking at what happened already to date from the billings point of view. Yet from a booking standpoint, I can see a trend that's looking out another two and four weeks and that's getting better than the trend we saw in the billing. Right, correct. Well, yes, certainly for the Jackson project that you'll see a lot of that is in the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 that scheduled outage sequential movement, Adam that goes, I think I said $0.44 in the fourth quarter. So that's a lot of where you'll see the Jackson impact. But as far as the other costs, I mean, yes, we don't expect them to be the, move sequentially. Like we were seeing, we expect to see between the second and third and frankly energy actually usually gets a little better because the temperatures are a little bit milder in the fourth quarter versus the hot summer months. So you expect some of your usages and some of your chemicals and energy and some of the wood yields and things like that. It typically gets a little better actually. So we would hope that you don't see near as large a sequential movement in cost going from 3Q to 4Q, but we'll see. Good morning. No."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kowlzan and please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Patricia. Good morning, everyone and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs the packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.  I'll begin the call with an overview of the first quarter results and then I am going to be turning the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide further details. And then I will wrap things up and we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $254 million or $2.70 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share primarily for certain cost at the Jackson Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities. Details of the special items for both the first quarter of 2022 and 202 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.  Excluding the special items, first quarter 2022 net income was $256 million or $2.72 per share, compared to first quarter 2021 net income of $169 million or $1.77 per share. First quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2022 and $1.8 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter excluding special items was $467 million in 2022 and $342 million in 2021.  Excluding the special items, the $0.95 per share increase in first quarter 2022 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.83 and volume of $0.23 in the packaging segment; higher prices and mix in our paper segment for $0.15, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases for $0.03; and lower interest expenses of $0.02.  These items were partially offset by $0.71 of inflation-related operating cost increases, particularly with energy, fiber, chemicals, operating labor, and repair labor and materials. Freight and logistics expenses have now moved higher for seven quarters in a row and were $0.27 per share above the first quarter of 2021 and converting costs were higher by $0.11 per share driven by labor and materials expenses.  We also had higher depreciation expenses of $0.07, lower volume in our paper segment were $0.06, higher scheduled outage expenses, $0.05, a higher tax rate resulting from some favorable items in the last year\u2019s tax rate of $0.03 and other costs $0.01. The results were $0.22 above our first quarter guidance of $2.50 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix and higher volumes in both our packaging and paper segments, operating cost improvements from efficiency and usage initiatives and favorable weather conditions.  Looking at the packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter of 2022 was $464 million with sales of $1,960 million, which resulted in a 23.6% margin versus last year\u2019s EBITDA of $352 million and sales of $1.62 billion or a 21.7% margin.  Demand in the packaging segment remained very strong as sales volume in both our containerboard mills and our corrugated products plants had record-setting performances. The scheduled maintenance outages in our mills went very well and both machines at our Jackson, Alabama mill produced containerboard the entire quarter.  However, with strong internal and external demand, we ended the quarter once again with containerboard inventory levels below our targeted and historical levels. Although we still face unprecedented inflationary headwinds in our manufacturing costs as well as freight and logistics expenses, our facilities continue to deliver on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, integration and optimization enhancements and capital project benefits to maximize our returns and their margins.  I\u2019ll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on the containerboard sales and corrugated products business. \nThomas Hassfurther: Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned, corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. We set a new all time total box shipments record, as well as a new first quarter shipments per day record. Total volume in our corrugated products plants was up 2.9% and shipments per day were up 1.3% versus a very strong comp in last year\u2019s first quarter, which for us was up approximately 8% over the prior year.  In addition to supplying to record internal needs of our box plants are outside sales volume of containerboard was 46,000 tons above the first quarter of 2021 owing to continued strong domestic and export demand. Outside volume was 26,000 tons below the fourth quarter of 2021 in order to help supply our strong internal demand while managing through the scheduled maintenance outages at our mills.  Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix contributed $1.60 per share above the first quarter of 2021 and were up $0.23 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.23 per share versus last year\u2019s first quarter and up a penny per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  The benefits of our disciplined approach for the implementation of price increases across our customer mix last year was a significant contributor to this year\u2019s first quarter results. Very good execution of the initial implementation of our recent March price increase contributed to results in the first quarter, as well. I\u2019d also like to point out that the capital spending and optimization strategy within our box plant system that we have been focused on over the last few years also plays a key role in our successful implementation process.  The investments from this strategy provide the products and service needs that our customers\u2019 desire and allows them to grow, while focusing on the mix of customers we want to align and partner with.  I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark. \nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at the paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter was $0.29 with sales of $153 million or an 18.9% margin, compared to the first quarter 2021 EBITDA of $0.16 million and sales of $165 million for a 9.6% margin. As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, volume from our paper segment this year is expected to be fairly representative of the capacity at our International Falls mill.  Accordingly, sales volume was about 19% below last year\u2019s first quarter when we were producing paper on the number one machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. Paper prices and mix were 14% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter and 6% above the fourth quarter of 2021 resulting from our previously announced paper price increases.  Also, in late March, we notified customers of $100 per ton price increase effective with shipments beginning May the 2nd for all office printing and converting papers. The efforts of our employees to optimize the cost structure, inventory and product mix in the paper business helped minimize the inflationary increases we are seeing and deliver solid returns in the quarter.  I\u2019ll now turn it over to Bob. \nRobert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. For the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $339 million and free cash flow of $113 million. Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $226 million and common stock dividends of $94 million. We ended the quarter with $629 million of cash on hand or $778 million including marketable securities. Our liquidity on March 31 was $1.1 billion.  I want to update you on a revision to the scheduled mill maintenance outage guidance that we provided on last quarter\u2019s call. Current plans and the scope of work has changed resulting at a revised total company estimated cost impact for the year of $1.04 per share versus the $1.13 per share previously. The actual impact in first quarter was $15 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.26 per share in the second quarter, $0.22 in the third and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter.  I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Mark. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter, we expect demand in our packaging segment to remain very strong and we will continue implementing the previously announced price increases in both our packaging and paper segments. Volume in the paper segment will be lower with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill and as Bob pointed out, total scheduled outage cost will be $0.11 higher than the first quarter.  We also anticipate continuing inflation with freight, logistics expenses as well as most of our operating costs although recycled fiber prices should be slightly lower. Considering all of these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $2.83 per share.  With that, we\u2019d be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  And with that, Patricia, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator:  Your first quarter comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. Your line is open. \nJohn Babcock: Hey, good morning. It\u2019s actually John Babcock on the line for George. Appreciate for taking the time to answer my questions. I guess just first of all, I was wondering if you might be able to talk about the cadence on the price increase implementation this time and if there is any reason to believe it might be different relative to some of the hikes last year, that\u2019ll be great. \nMark Kowlzan: Go ahead, Tom. \nThomas Hassfurther: Yeah, the implementation is right on track just like the others. We have a very disciplined approach. We usually get the pass through over about a 90 day period. So, as I mentioned, we had some that was in the month of March. But the majority of the price increase will be in the second quarter. \nJohn Babcock: Okay. Thank you. And the next question, just as it pertains to trucking, I was wondering, if you could talk about what you are seeing in terms of spot rates for that? Also some of our contacts they just said prices might be dropping here. So just want to get any color that you might have.\nMark Kowlzan: Bob, do you want to add a little to that? \nRobert Mundy: Yeah, John, I\u2019ll just say that, we are seeing a little bit of that relative to the spot market. There are various factors going on that showed a little improvement in the first quarter, but I think as most people would agree, that\u2019s still far from being in an ideal situation and our guidance for the second quarter again we have our freight costs are going up probably another 5% or so. So, still a lot to be done there. \nMark Kowlzan: I think you need to consider again that diesel still sitting at over $5 a gallon and that\u2019s one of the predominant cost factors and although some of the drivers in the spot market will become more available, the cost remain at exceptional high levels. \nJohn Babcock: Gotcha. And then a last question before I turn it over. With I Falls downtime, maintenance downtime that you have this upcoming quarter, could you just talk about the normal steps that you would take to ensure the customers get the product they need and ultimately anything that you\u2019ll do around inventory build, just to make sure that you are able to serve their needs. \nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, that\u2019s a shutdown that\u2019s been planned for the last six months. And so, it\u2019s a weeklong outage that will take place in June. And so, you have to assume that we\u2019ve already preplanned to have a necessary inventory and how we\u2019ll take care of customers and so it\u2019s really not an issue to our part of the shutdown planning. \nJohn Babcock: Okay, okay. Thanks, again. \nMark Kowlzan: Next question please? \nOperator: We have your next question from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. \nMark Wilde : Thanks. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Tom. Good morning, Bob. \nThomas Hassfurther: Good morning. \nMark Kowlzan: Hey, Mark. \nMark Wilde : Mark, just to start up, it seems like there is some awful lot of new investment in corrugating capacity including new wider corrugators kind of coming into the industry because we\u2019ve been with very tight for box capacity. What impact is this having on mills and machine efficiency if any? \nMark Kowlzan: Well, speaking for us, it\u2019s really not a factor. We continue to invest in our own box plants over at least the half dozen years now. We\u2019ve added new corrugators. There are certain optimal size corrugators that we prefer that some \u2013 a few have gone to the very large 130 inch type corrugators. Again, there is certain optimal levels. I don\u2019t think there is a real strong relationship to mill efficiency and corrugator size necessarily. Tom, do you want to add a little further?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, I would just say that if you got some narrow machines, that can create some issues relative to the wider corrugators. So that\u2019s \u2013 that to me would be the largest impact you probably see in the mills is just some scheduling issues on narrow machines. \nMark Kowlzan: From the old machines, yes.\nMark Wilde : Okay. Tom, and I am curious, it seems like over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve been getting more reports about sort of subcontracting out of corrugated volumes during the pandemic. I think this is because of strong demand and the labor shortages. Have you guys seen any impact from this in your system that you have that subcontract out more? \nThomas Hassfurther: I think, Mark, we have kind of a unique system from the standpoint of we have a lot of corrugated plants and we have a lot of sheet plants. So, I think in terms of flexibility, sometimes we have a little bit more than some of our competitors might. And that\u2019s where I see a lot of this subcontracting as you call it is probably more in the independent sheet network as opposed to anywhere else. And like I said, we are able to handle that type of business. So, for us, now we are cutting up everything that we \u2013 all our demand internally. \nMark Wilde : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Finally, Mark, I wonder if you could give us some updated timeline and ultimate capacity on the conversion to two machines at Jackson. \nMark Kowlzan: Well, the primary emphasis at Jackson is that\u2019s the number three machine and as we called out earlier this year, we pushed that outage off to October period because of supply chain issues. When that last phase is completed a year from now, we anticipate that the Jackson number three machine should have 700,000 ton a year capacity built into it. Right now, the number one machine, we are not planning on any significant upgrades at this time. We\u2019ve got studies done as you would imagine. That would be an opportunity for the future if we choose to move in that direction. But we will have a good opportunity to absorb the full production of number three machine through later next year and into 2024. \nMark Wilde : What was the capacity at number one be without the upgrade and then potentially what could that go to if you put some capital into in ballpark terms? \nMark Kowlzan: Today, if you think about number one machine at Jackson with no capital investment, it\u2019s somewhere under 25,000 tons a year type of runrate with the basis which we are running, which is a pretty good place to be considering we haven\u2019t invested any capital in. \nMark Wilde : Okay. Very good. I\u2019ll turn it over. \nMark Kowlzan: It\u2019s like any other machine we talked about over the decades, it\u2019s all a matter of capital, how much capital do you want to spend for on which capacity, because once you reach a certain critical point, you really get into diminishing returns, because now you are getting into the bigger pieces of capital required for back end infrastructure pulping and all of the related pulp capacity requirements. So, there is certainly an economic analysis that takes place that you quickly reach a peak return and then diminish. So, I think where we are with what we are looking at, if you are producing 700,000 tons a year on number three machine, and 120,000, 140,000 tons a year on number one machine, that\u2019s a very good place for Jackson, Alabama to be on a cost and a profit curve. \nMark Wilde : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over, Mark. Thank you. \nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question please? \nOperator: Okay. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research. Your line is open. \nMark Weintraub : Thank you. Congrats on another well executed quarter. First two follow-ups, one, you mentioned that it normally takes about 90 days to fully implement from board into box. So, can we conclude that a portion of the pricing will show up on an average basis in the third quarter as well that there will be some additional we\u2019ll see a lot of that in the second quarter and then we should see some incremental as we average the numbers from quarter-to-quarter in the third quarter? \nThomas Hassfurther: Hey Mark. This is Tom, yeah, that would be a good read in. \nMark Weintraub : Okay. \nThomas Hassfurther: Go ahead, Mark. \nMark Weintraub : And can you give us any sense if we look back historically what percentage might typically show up in that period within this case would be the third quarter? \nThomas Hassfurther: No, it\u2019s \u2013 I think, as I said, I mean, these things rolled in over a 90 day period. I mean, there are few accounts that have certain contracts that may go even beyond that, but for the most part it\u2019s the 90 day period and we have indicated that there is some in March and that the bulk will be in the second quarter and yeah, there might be a little rollover into the third quarter. That\u2019s the only guidance I can give you. \nMark Weintraub : Okay. So, just a little up. Okay, thank you. And you mentioned the Jackson machine going to 700, but is it about 500,000 that \u2013 what\u2019s the production capacity currently at Jackson?\nThomas Hassfurther: You are in that, probably 440,000 tons a year, 450,000 tons a year on that machine and again it\u2019s just tons on the Grade Metro running and then the 125,000 tons. If you look at last year, running the machine for one quarter we produced 459,000 tons for the year for the first quarter we just produced 136,000 tons. So you are talking about for the full year runrate with which we continue to run at this pace somewhere 550,000 tons for the year expected out of Jackson. \nMark Weintraub : Okay. Thank you. And then, lastly, you mentioned the packaging demand looking good into the second quarter, can you update us on what you are looking for in the first part of August \u2013 sorry, April?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yeah, from \u2013 so far in April, we are up 3.5% over and so, keep in mind though that last April, we were up 12%. So, this is a big, big jump on top of last April. So demand still remains very good. \nMark Weintraub : I appreciate all the color. Thank you. \nOperator: We have your next question from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open. Phil Ng, your line is open. Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Your line is open. \nAnthony Pettinari : Good morning. \nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Anthony. \nAnthony Pettinari : Can you maybe talk a little bit more about inventory levels in terms of where you are versus where you\u2019d like to be and maybe potential timeline for getting there. And then, given the supply chain constraints, I mean, do you think just structurally you might hold a higher level of inventory than in the pre-pandemic period? And then, I guess, finally, anything that your customers have said about their inventories that\u2019s maybe worsened or gotten better or any kind of read from them? \nMark Kowlzan: As we called out, we are still below where we would want to be. We are still below our historical target levels and a lot of it obviously has to do with the pandemic related supply chain, transportation matters. And so, we are into the heavy shutdown periods of a year as we come out of that. Things generally improve. But I think also part of your question, we would anticipate for the time being trying to hold a higher level than we had historically hold prior to the pandemic. But again with this volume continuing to grow with the rate it\u2019s growing and logistics, supply chain issues, railroad trucking doing what they\u2019ve been doing, it\u2019s very difficult to build to the necessary inventory levels. \nAnthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just on the very strong demand that you\u2019ve seen, is there any finer point you\u2019d put on customer groups or end-markets that are seeing, especially stronger demand or maybe some demand that\u2019s softening a little bit? And then just broadly, I mean, are your local accounts, are they maybe outperforming national accounts or just any color you can give on what has been extremely strong demand, it seems like it\u2019s continuing into April. \nThomas Hassfurther: Anthony, this is Tom. I\u2019ll handle the demand piece. Demand is, as I said, is very strong, I think representative of that strength is, if you just look at our top 50 accounts in the first quarter, they were up 7% on average, now that includes some that were up double-digits, that includes some that were down slightly, but depending on the business that they are in. But if you just look kind of broadly across just, like I said, those 50 accounts, you see that they are in lots of different businesses and demand remains very strong across all of those businesses. Relative to local versus national, I mean, you\u2019ve got the puts and the takes as I just talked about, but generally speaking, I think that the larger accounts have a little bit more of an ability to work through some of the issues that are going on. Perhaps, more so than some of the smaller accounts, but again, it\u2019s \u2013 everybody says that can grow a lot more than what they are currently able to grow. They are just held up by all these supply chain issues primarily and the labor issues that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. \nAnthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s great color. I\u2019ll turn it over. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: We have your next question from Cleve Rueckert from UBS. Your line is open. \nCleve Rueckert: Great. Thanks everybody for taking my questions. Good morning. \nMark Kowlzan: Good morning. \nCleve Rueckert: I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but just a follow-up quickly on demand. I mean, PCA has done, I mean, frankly very impressive job of taking market share in this business over the last 12 to 18 months, call it. Do you have a sense of, whether the growth you are seeing is like end demand market growth or are you just continuing to execute well and take market share? \nMark Kowlzan: Well, I would say, I would say that, our long-term strategy and I just mentioned it in the commentary too, is to really spend a lot of time making sure we align with the right kind of customers. And we\u2019ve been doing that for decades. So, most \u2013 the great majority of our growth comes from our existing accounts and their ability to grow and our ability to help them growing whatever way we possibly can. So, that\u2019s the majority of where PCA\u2019s growth comes from. And we\u2019ve demonstrated that not just in the recent past but certainly over the long term. \nCleve Rueckert: Okay. That\u2019s clear. And then, just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, I want to follow-up on John\u2019s question about freight and trucking. We are seeing the same things about spot pricing, but we\u2019ve also heard the \u2013 some of the logistics is moving out of the spot market and into the contract market. I\u2019d just be curious if you are changing your strategy at all, especially as it relates to the trucking market? \nMark Kowlzan: No, we are not necessarily changing strategy or taking advantage of some of the availability improving, but there is no major change in strategy. Tom, do you want to add anything? \nThomas Hassfurther: No. We\u2019ve been under contracts for the most part and we don\u2019t use that much spot trade through. \nCleve Rueckert: Yeah, okay. That\u2019s clear. And then, just on labor productivity, I think we heard pretty broadly last quarter that the labor, especially in the box system was kind of a constraint to production and constrained productivity. I mean, you guys obviously burned inventory this quarter, but I\u2019d just be curious if that\u2019s easing at all or if there is any sort of bottleneck on the labor side that\u2019s holding you back on the productivity side?\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, again, keep in mind, if you think about a commentary we\u2019ve made over the last year with our capital investment in the last few years, we\u2019ve been able to make significant improvements in the productivity in our box plants and then continue to grow our capability in terms of productivity per unit, man hour employed. With that being said, with the labor market there, there is still an incredible amount of stress on the labor pool in the converting side and the mill side. Tom, do you want to add a little color to it?\nThomas Hassfurther: Yeah, there is no question. I mean, our labor situation improved as a result of the COVID, especially the omicron variant going down some. So, that was a help to our labor situation. But on the other hand, trying to hire new people and replace retirees et cetera is still a bit of a challenge and will remain so. If you just look at any of the statistics and the 8 million jobs that are sitting there open, the highest labor participation rate in decades, we\u2019ve got certainly I think everybody in any industry would attest to the fact that labor is a real challenge. \nCleve Rueckert: That\u2019s all very clear. Thanks for answering the questions. I appreciate you guys. \nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question please? \nOperator: Thank you.  We have your next question from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. \nMark Wilde : Thanks. Start with a couple of follow-ups. One, is it possible for you to just to help us differentiate the level of inflation you are seeing at the mill level versus what you are seeing at the converting level? It does seem like converting plants are seeing more cost pressure than I have ever seen in my career between labor, starches, pallets, energy, other issues? \nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, I think, again, it\u2019s relative, Mark, across the board you have to understand that everything is under tremendous inflationary pressure. What you just said is correct. Tom, do you want to go ahead and add some detail for that last point?\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, I am just going to agree wholeheartedly with you, Mark. I have never seen anything like the across the board inflation we are dealing with in box plants. We can talk about some of the big numbers, transportation, those sorts of things. But when you start talking about all the things you just mentioned, the labor, the starch, the pallets, the ink, the dyes, any equipment repairs, any of those sorts of things, it\u2019s just, these are numbers that I\u2019ve never seen before upwards of as much as 200% in some cases. \nMark Wilde : Okay. And then, Mark, the other question I had is, you\u2019ve created a lot of incremental benefits by taking advantage of conversion opportunities at DeRidder, at Wallula, at Ala, Jackson, is there anything at International Falls that would prevent you from building the same kind of thing there at some point in time? \nMark Kowlzan: No, as a matter of fact, the I Falls is another example of a mill that it\u2019s a market dictated, we could take advantage of in a very, very good way as far as paper market and then how that plays into our growth in our corrugated products business. Again, as you heard us talk about, we are always studying and planning and looking at opportunities and we\u2019ve got the plants, putting the file on what we want to do some day if the market conditions were such that it dictated we needed to make a decision about I Falls.  But keep in mind that the big machine at I Falls, the I1 machine is quite frankly a better version of what we have at Jackson on J3. They were both essentially sister machines installed at a similar timeframe few decades ago and they have tremendous capability. The mill infrastructure at I Falls has tremendous capability to support conversion.  But again, it\u2019s all about box demand versus paper demand and profitability. So, we have that opportunity, but I Falls is another one of the opportunity that\u2019s sitting there that could be taken advantage of some day. \nMark Wilde : Okay. And would it just be fair to assume, Mark, given that it\u2019s primarily a hardwood mill right now that you\u2019d be more likely to take that towards corrugating medium rather than line of borders, is that not a good assumption? \nMark Kowlzan: That\u2019s a bad assumption. \nMark Wilde : Okay. Good enough. Thanks. \nMark Kowlzan: Yeah. Next question please?\nOperator: Mr. Kowlzan, I am not seeing any more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Again, thanks everybody for joining us today on the call and we look forward to talking with you at the latter part of July. Have a good day everybody. Thanks. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. ",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned, corrugated products and containerboard demand were very strong during the quarter. We set a new all time total box shipments record, as well as a new first quarter shipments per day record. Total volume in our corrugated products plants was up 2.9% and shipments per day were up 1.3% versus a very strong comp in last year's first quarter, which for us was up approximately 8% over the prior year.  In addition to supplying to record internal needs of our box plants are outside sales volume of containerboard was 46,000 tons above the first quarter of 2021 owing to continued strong domestic and export demand. Outside volume was 26,000 tons below the fourth quarter of 2021 in order to help supply our strong internal demand while managing through the scheduled maintenance outages at our mills.  Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix contributed $1.60 per share above the first quarter of 2021 and were up $0.23 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Export containerboard prices were up $0.23 per share versus last year's first quarter and up a penny per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  The benefits of our disciplined approach for the implementation of price increases across our customer mix last year was a significant contributor to this year's first quarter results. Very good execution of the initial implementation of our recent March price increase contributed to results in the first quarter, as well. I'd also like to point out that the capital spending and optimization strategy within our box plant system that we have been focused on over the last few years also plays a key role in our successful implementation process.  The investments from this strategy provide the products and service needs that our customers' desire and allows them to grow, while focusing on the mix of customers we want to align and partner with.  I'll now turn it back to Mark. Yeah, the implementation is right on track just like the others. We have a very disciplined approach. We usually get the pass through over about a 90 day period. So, as I mentioned, we had some that was in the month of March. But the majority of the price increase will be in the second quarter. Good morning. Well, I would just say that if you got some narrow machines, that can create some issues relative to the wider corrugators. So that's \u2013 that to me would be the largest impact you probably see in the mills is just some scheduling issues on narrow machines. I think, Mark, we have kind of a unique system from the standpoint of we have a lot of corrugated plants and we have a lot of sheet plants. So, I think in terms of flexibility, sometimes we have a little bit more than some of our competitors might. And that's where I see a lot of this subcontracting as you call it is probably more in the independent sheet network as opposed to anywhere else. And like I said, we are able to handle that type of business. So, for us, now we are cutting up everything that we \u2013 all our demand internally. Hey Mark. This is Tom, yeah, that would be a good read in. Go ahead, Mark. No, it's \u2013 I think, as I said, I mean, these things rolled in over a 90 day period. I mean, there are few accounts that have certain contracts that may go even beyond that, but for the most part it's the 90 day period and we have indicated that there is some in March and that the bulk will be in the second quarter and yeah, there might be a little rollover into the third quarter. That's the only guidance I can give you. You are in that, probably 440,000 tons a year, 450,000 tons a year on that machine and again it's just tons on the Grade Metro running and then the 125,000 tons. If you look at last year, running the machine for one quarter we produced 459,000 tons for the year for the first quarter we just produced 136,000 tons. So you are talking about for the full year runrate with which we continue to run at this pace somewhere 550,000 tons for the year expected out of Jackson. Yeah, from \u2013 so far in April, we are up 3.5% over and so, keep in mind though that last April, we were up 12%. So, this is a big, big jump on top of last April. So demand still remains very good. Anthony, this is Tom. I'll handle the demand piece. Demand is, as I said, is very strong, I think representative of that strength is, if you just look at our top 50 accounts in the first quarter, they were up 7% on average, now that includes some that were up double-digits, that includes some that were down slightly, but depending on the business that they are in. But if you just look kind of broadly across just, like I said, those 50 accounts, you see that they are in lots of different businesses and demand remains very strong across all of those businesses. Relative to local versus national, I mean, you've got the puts and the takes as I just talked about, but generally speaking, I think that the larger accounts have a little bit more of an ability to work through some of the issues that are going on. Perhaps, more so than some of the smaller accounts, but again, it's \u2013 everybody says that can grow a lot more than what they are currently able to grow. They are just held up by all these supply chain issues primarily and the labor issues that we've talked about in the past. No. We've been under contracts for the most part and we don't use that much spot trade through. Yeah, there is no question. I mean, our labor situation improved as a result of the COVID, especially the omicron variant going down some. So, that was a help to our labor situation. But on the other hand, trying to hire new people and replace retirees et cetera is still a bit of a challenge and will remain so. If you just look at any of the statistics and the 8 million jobs that are sitting there open, the highest labor participation rate in decades, we've got certainly I think everybody in any industry would attest to the fact that labor is a real challenge. Well, I am just going to agree wholeheartedly with you, Mark. I have never seen anything like the across the board inflation we are dealing with in box plants. We can talk about some of the big numbers, transportation, those sorts of things. But when you start talking about all the things you just mentioned, the labor, the starch, the pallets, the ink, the dyes, any equipment repairs, any of those sorts of things, it's just, these are numbers that I've never seen before upwards of as much as 200% in some cases."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Patricia. Good morning, everyone and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. I am Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs the packaging business and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer.  I'll begin the call with an overview of the first quarter results and then I am going to be turning the call over to Tom and Bob who will provide further details. And then I will wrap things up and we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $254 million or $2.70 per share. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share primarily for certain cost at the Jackson Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion related activities. Details of the special items for both the first quarter of 2022 and 202 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.  Excluding the special items, first quarter 2022 net income was $256 million or $2.72 per share, compared to first quarter 2021 net income of $169 million or $1.77 per share. First quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2022 and $1.8 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter excluding special items was $467 million in 2022 and $342 million in 2021.  Excluding the special items, the $0.95 per share increase in first quarter 2022 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by higher prices and mix of $1.83 and volume of $0.23 in the packaging segment; higher prices and mix in our paper segment for $0.15, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases for $0.03; and lower interest expenses of $0.02.  These items were partially offset by $0.71 of inflation-related operating cost increases, particularly with energy, fiber, chemicals, operating labor, and repair labor and materials. Freight and logistics expenses have now moved higher for seven quarters in a row and were $0.27 per share above the first quarter of 2021 and converting costs were higher by $0.11 per share driven by labor and materials expenses.  We also had higher depreciation expenses of $0.07, lower volume in our paper segment were $0.06, higher scheduled outage expenses, $0.05, a higher tax rate resulting from some favorable items in the last year's tax rate of $0.03 and other costs $0.01. The results were $0.22 above our first quarter guidance of $2.50 per share primarily due to higher prices and mix and higher volumes in both our packaging and paper segments, operating cost improvements from efficiency and usage initiatives and favorable weather conditions.  Looking at the packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter of 2022 was $464 million with sales of $1,960 million, which resulted in a 23.6% margin versus last year's EBITDA of $352 million and sales of $1.62 billion or a 21.7% margin.  Demand in the packaging segment remained very strong as sales volume in both our containerboard mills and our corrugated products plants had record-setting performances. The scheduled maintenance outages in our mills went very well and both machines at our Jackson, Alabama mill produced containerboard the entire quarter.  However, with strong internal and external demand, we ended the quarter once again with containerboard inventory levels below our targeted and historical levels. Although we still face unprecedented inflationary headwinds in our manufacturing costs as well as freight and logistics expenses, our facilities continue to deliver on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, integration and optimization enhancements and capital project benefits to maximize our returns and their margins.  I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on the containerboard sales and corrugated products business. Thanks, Tom. Looking at the paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter was $0.29 with sales of $153 million or an 18.9% margin, compared to the first quarter 2021 EBITDA of $0.16 million and sales of $165 million for a 9.6% margin. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, volume from our paper segment this year is expected to be fairly representative of the capacity at our International Falls mill.  Accordingly, sales volume was about 19% below last year's first quarter when we were producing paper on the number one machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. Paper prices and mix were 14% higher than last year's first quarter and 6% above the fourth quarter of 2021 resulting from our previously announced paper price increases.  Also, in late March, we notified customers of $100 per ton price increase effective with shipments beginning May the 2nd for all office printing and converting papers. The efforts of our employees to optimize the cost structure, inventory and product mix in the paper business helped minimize the inflationary increases we are seeing and deliver solid returns in the quarter.  I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter, we expect demand in our packaging segment to remain very strong and we will continue implementing the previously announced price increases in both our packaging and paper segments. Volume in the paper segment will be lower with the scheduled outage at our International Falls mill and as Bob pointed out, total scheduled outage cost will be $0.11 higher than the first quarter.  We also anticipate continuing inflation with freight, logistics expenses as well as most of our operating costs although recycled fiber prices should be slightly lower. Considering all of these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $2.83 per share.  With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.  And with that, Patricia, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please. Go ahead, Tom. Bob, do you want to add a little to that? I think you need to consider again that diesel still sitting at over $5 a gallon and that's one of the predominant cost factors and although some of the drivers in the spot market will become more available, the cost remain at exceptional high levels. Yeah, that's a shutdown that's been planned for the last six months. And so, it's a weeklong outage that will take place in June. And so, you have to assume that we've already preplanned to have a necessary inventory and how we'll take care of customers and so it's really not an issue to our part of the shutdown planning. Next question please? Hey, Mark. Well, speaking for us, it's really not a factor. We continue to invest in our own box plants over at least the half dozen years now. We've added new corrugators. There are certain optimal size corrugators that we prefer that some \u2013 a few have gone to the very large 130 inch type corrugators. Again, there is certain optimal levels. I don't think there is a real strong relationship to mill efficiency and corrugator size necessarily. Tom, do you want to add a little further? From the old machines, yes. Well, the primary emphasis at Jackson is that's the number three machine and as we called out earlier this year, we pushed that outage off to October period because of supply chain issues. When that last phase is completed a year from now, we anticipate that the Jackson number three machine should have 700,000 ton a year capacity built into it. Right now, the number one machine, we are not planning on any significant upgrades at this time. We've got studies done as you would imagine. That would be an opportunity for the future if we choose to move in that direction. But we will have a good opportunity to absorb the full production of number three machine through later next year and into 2024. Today, if you think about number one machine at Jackson with no capital investment, it's somewhere under 25,000 tons a year type of runrate with the basis which we are running, which is a pretty good place to be considering we haven't invested any capital in. It's like any other machine we talked about over the decades, it's all a matter of capital, how much capital do you want to spend for on which capacity, because once you reach a certain critical point, you really get into diminishing returns, because now you are getting into the bigger pieces of capital required for back end infrastructure pulping and all of the related pulp capacity requirements. So, there is certainly an economic analysis that takes place that you quickly reach a peak return and then diminish. So, I think where we are with what we are looking at, if you are producing 700,000 tons a year on number three machine, and 120,000, 140,000 tons a year on number one machine, that's a very good place for Jackson, Alabama to be on a cost and a profit curve. Okay. Next question please? Good morning, Anthony. As we called out, we are still below where we would want to be. We are still below our historical target levels and a lot of it obviously has to do with the pandemic related supply chain, transportation matters. And so, we are into the heavy shutdown periods of a year as we come out of that. Things generally improve. But I think also part of your question, we would anticipate for the time being trying to hold a higher level than we had historically hold prior to the pandemic. But again with this volume continuing to grow with the rate it's growing and logistics, supply chain issues, railroad trucking doing what they've been doing, it's very difficult to build to the necessary inventory levels. Thank you. Next question please? Good morning. Well, I would say, I would say that, our long-term strategy and I just mentioned it in the commentary too, is to really spend a lot of time making sure we align with the right kind of customers. And we've been doing that for decades. So, most \u2013 the great majority of our growth comes from our existing accounts and their ability to grow and our ability to help them growing whatever way we possibly can. So, that's the majority of where PCA's growth comes from. And we've demonstrated that not just in the recent past but certainly over the long term. No, we are not necessarily changing strategy or taking advantage of some of the availability improving, but there is no major change in strategy. Tom, do you want to add anything? Yeah, again, keep in mind, if you think about a commentary we've made over the last year with our capital investment in the last few years, we've been able to make significant improvements in the productivity in our box plants and then continue to grow our capability in terms of productivity per unit, man hour employed. With that being said, with the labor market there, there is still an incredible amount of stress on the labor pool in the converting side and the mill side. Tom, do you want to add a little color to it? Okay. Next question please? Yeah, I think, again, it's relative, Mark, across the board you have to understand that everything is under tremendous inflationary pressure. What you just said is correct. Tom, do you want to go ahead and add some detail for that last point? No, as a matter of fact, the I Falls is another example of a mill that it's a market dictated, we could take advantage of in a very, very good way as far as paper market and then how that plays into our growth in our corrugated products business. Again, as you heard us talk about, we are always studying and planning and looking at opportunities and we've got the plants, putting the file on what we want to do some day if the market conditions were such that it dictated we needed to make a decision about I Falls.  But keep in mind that the big machine at I Falls, the I1 machine is quite frankly a better version of what we have at Jackson on J3. They were both essentially sister machines installed at a similar timeframe few decades ago and they have tremendous capability. The mill infrastructure at I Falls has tremendous capability to support conversion.  But again, it's all about box demand versus paper demand and profitability. So, we have that opportunity, but I Falls is another one of the opportunity that's sitting there that could be taken advantage of some day. That's a bad assumption. Yeah. Next question please? Again, thanks everybody for joining us today on the call and we look forward to talking with you at the latter part of July. Have a good day everybody. Thanks."

Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $226 million and common stock dividends of $94 million. We ended the quarter with $629 million of cash on hand or $778 million including marketable securities. Our liquidity on March 31 was $1.1 billion.  I want to update you on a revision to the scheduled mill maintenance outage guidance that we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and the scope of work has changed resulting at a revised total company estimated cost impact for the year of $1.04 per share versus the $1.13 per share previously. The actual impact in first quarter was $15 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.26 per share in the second quarter, $0.22 in the third and $0.41 per share in the fourth quarter.  I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yeah, John, I'll just say that, we are seeing a little bit of that relative to the spot market. There are various factors going on that showed a little improvement in the first quarter, but I think as most people would agree, that's still far from being in an ideal situation and our guidance for the second quarter again we have our freight costs are going up probably another 5% or so. So, still a lot to be done there."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I will begin the call with an overview of the fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. After they're done, I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2023 net income of $189 million or $2.10 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2023 net income was $192 million or $2.13 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022\u2019s net income of $215 million or $2.35 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.94 billion in 2023 and $1.98 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items was $394 million in 2023 and $409 million in 2022. Excluding the special items, we also reported full year 2023 earnings of $784 million or $8.70 per share compared to the 2022 earnings of $1.04 billion or $11.14 per share. Net sales were $7.8 billion in 2023 and $8.5 billion in 2022. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2023 was $1.6 billion compared to the $1.9 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income included special items primarily for certain costs at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper-to-containerboard conversion-related activities and the closure and other costs related to corrugated products facilities and design center. Details of all special items for the year 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.22 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2023 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix of $1.93 in the Packaging segment, lower prices and mix $0.04, and volume $0.03 in the Paper segment and higher depreciation expense $0.10. These items were partially offset by very good volume in the Packaging segment of $1.07 per share. We also had lower operating and converting costs of $0.51 driven by very good process efficiencies and control over other usages of fiber, chemicals, energy, materials and labor as well as lower energy and wood fiber prices. In addition, we had lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.19, lower freight and logistics expenses $0.03, lower other expenses $0.04 and a lower share count resulting from share repurchases $0.04. The results were $0.37 above the fourth quarter guidance of $1.76 per share, primarily due to higher volumes in our Packaging segment, lower operating and converting costs, lower freight and logistics expenses. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $385 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $392 million and sales of $1.8 billion and also a 21.7% margin. For the full year 2023, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding special items was $1.6 billion with sales of $7.1 billion or 21.8% margin compared to the full year 2022 EBITDA of $1.8 billion with sales of $7.8 billion or a 23.8% margin. Throughout the quarter, demand in the Packaging segment was stronger than our expectations. This higher volume along with the operational benefits of our capital spending program and continued emphasis on cost management and process efficiencies across the entire manufacturing and converting facility system drove operating and converting costs lower as well. We had an excellent restart of the Wallula, Washington mill and the No. 3 machine during the latter part of October and ran exceptionally well during the November, December period. And that helped us meet the stronger demand and build some needed inventory during the quarter to ensure the customers \u2013 that our customers were supplied with their needs. We plan to restart the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill in this first quarter to help manage our expectations in the first half of 2024 for continued strong demand together with scheduled mill maintenance outages and the final phase of the containerboard conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 5.1% and total shipments with one additional shipping day were up 6.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Versus the third quarter of 2023, shipments per day were up 5.2% and total shipments were up 3.4%, even though there was one less shipping day. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 88,000 tons above last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 tons above the third quarter of 2023. Our order backlog and containerboard cut-up remained incredibly strong throughout the quarter. Although demand continues to be challenged by persistent inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, we expect our shipments to continue this positive momentum as we enter the first half of 2024. Relative to the published reductions in the industry benchmark grades that occurred in 2023, Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.73 per share below the fourth quarter of 2022 and down $0.40 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2023, which included a richer mix of graphics and point-of-purchase display business. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.20 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and down $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2023. Beginning January 1, 2024, we began invoicing a $70 per ton price increase for linerboard and $100 per ton increase for medium according to our recent price announcement. As you are probably aware, this past Friday, the RISI Pulp and Paper Week publication did not recognize any increase in the industry's benchmark prices for either linerboard or medium. I'm sure you will have some questions for us on this topic, and we'll be happy to discuss them with you shortly. I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $35 million with sales of $144 million or a 24.5% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2022's EBITDA of $39 million and sales of $154 million or 25.7% margin. For the full year 2023, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items was $151 million with sales of $595 million or a record 25.3% margin compared to the full year 2022 EBITDA of $132 million with sales of $622 million or a 21.3% margin. Prices and mix were down 3% from last year's fourth quarter and from the third quarter of 2023, driven by the declines in the index prices that occurred during the year. Although, slightly better than our fourth quarter guidance, sales volume was 3% below last year's fourth quarter and down approximately 6% versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2023. The management team and all the employees of our paper business have done a tremendous job over the last several quarters to optimize our inventory and product mix, and remain focused on efficient and cost-effective operations in order to continue delivering outstanding results during 2023. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $335 million and free cash flow was $194 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $141 million, dividend payments of $112 million, cash tax payments of $59 million and net interest payments of $26 million. For the full year 2023, cash from operations was $1.3 billion with capital spending of $470 million and free cash flow, a record $845 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2023 was 24.5%. During the fourth quarter, we issued $400 million of new 10-year notes. The proceeds from these notes will be used to redeem our $400 million notes that mature in September of 2024. Our net debt is not affected by this transaction and the proceeds from this issuance will be invested in marketable securities at an interest rate exceeding that of the new notes. The new bonds raised our overall fixed interest rate by approximately 30 basis points and extended the overall average maturity of our debt portfolio from 14.1 years to 15.6 years. Excluding the proceeds from this transaction, our year-end cash on-hand balance, including marketable securities, was just over $800 million, with liquidity of $1.1 billion. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $470 million to $490 million. And DD&A is expected to be approximately $530 million. We estimate dividend payments of $450 million and cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $27 million. Our full year interest expense in 2024 is expected to be approximately $53 million and net cash interest payments should be about $60 million. The estimate for our 2024 book effective tax rate is 25%. Currently, planned annual outages at our mills in 2024 including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs is expected to total $0.96 per share. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2024 is $0.26 per share in the first quarter, $0.16 in the second, $0.19 in the third and $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter. These expenses include the volume and cost impact that will be incurred during the completion of the final phase of converting the No. 3 machine at the Jackson mill to containerboard during the first and second quarters. This will negatively impact our first quarter results by approximately $0.16 per share and our second quarter results by $0.08 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. I'm very proud of the outstanding results PCA delivered in 2023 under very challenging demand conditions. We successfully completed numerous cost reduction and process improvement projects along with other key strategic initiatives at the containerboard mills and corrugated products plants. Our dedicated sales and customer service organizations continue to be extremely motivated and understanding the business of our customers. They were very responsive to our customers' needs and works proactively to help them with their solutions to their opportunities and their challenges. These combined efforts allowed us to enhance our entire packaging business and deliver profitable growth opportunities for our customers and shareholders now and into the future. 2023 also saw our paper business deliver record margins reflecting the capabilities of our employees to optimize our product mix, inventory, distribution channels and overhead structure, along with running very efficient manufacturing operations. These accomplishments helped us to achieve a new all-time annual record free cash flow. We ended the year with over $1.1 billion of liquidity and extended the overall average debt maturity to almost 16 years. We continued our commitment to a strong balance sheet and a balanced approach towards capital allocation. This allows us to profitably grow the company and to maximize returns for our shareholders, while maintaining the financial flexibility to react quickly to situations and opportunities. None of these things would be possible without the hard work of the talented employees and strong partnerships we\u2019ve built with our customers and suppliers over many, many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, as Tom indicated in our Packaging segment, we expect continued positive momentum in demand, along with two additional shipping days in the first quarter to drive higher total corrugated product shipments. Despite restarting the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill, containerboard volume will be lower due to the downtime associated with the conversion of the No. 3 machine at the Jackson mill and a scheduled maintenance outage at the Counce, Tennessee mill. Prices and mix should be slightly higher with the implementation of our announced January price increases partially offset by a decrease in the published benchmark prices that occurred late in 2023 with export prices fairly flat. In our Paper segment, we expect an improved mix to move prices slightly higher with flat sales volume. Recycled fiber and energy prices will be higher and unusually cold seasonal weather will negatively impact usages and yields for energy, wood and chemicals, along with higher operating costs associated with the restart of the full operations at the Wallula mill compared to the fourth quarter operations. Labor and benefits costs will have seasonal timing related increases that occur at the beginning of a new year related to annual wage and benefit increases, the restart of payroll taxes and share-based compensation expenses. And finally, as Bob mentioned, scheduled outage expenses will include the significant first quarter impact of the conversion outage at the Jackson mill, which is estimated to be $0.16 per share. Considering these items, we expect the first quarter earnings of $1.54 per share. And with that, Jamie, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. And we can proceed as you call it out. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, congrats on another really strong year in a challenging environment. So you say in the press release that that you are expecting a little slightly higher pricing despite the $20 decrease in November. And obviously you\u2019re including some from the January increase, which as you mentioned, we\u2019re going to have questions undoubtedly. Is that fair to say that you\u2019re including a little bit more than $20 on average in the 1Q? How should we think about that?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, Mark, this Tom. Yes, it\u2019s slightly above the $20. We\u2019ve got the follow through on that published $20 down. And as I said, we put the linerboard of medium price increase into effect January 1. And we\u2019re invoicing accordingly and getting paid accordingly. And I might also add that as a net buyer, we also have accepted the $70 increase on the buy side and have been paying invoices accordingly.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. And sorry, just to clarify, so when you said net $20, was that the increase minus the impact of the $20, or was that that you\u2019re effectively, because of the way the lags work, et cetera, as you push it through into box prices, that the impact of the $70 that\u2019s been announced is slightly more than $20 in the first quarter? I apologize for the question, but just clarify.\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, you\u2019re pretty much right. And you got to also think about it is, is the $20 is factoring into the box business right now given contract triggers.\nMark Weintraub: Got it. Understood. And lastly and I\u2019ll turn over. Could you sense of how demand is shaping up in January so far for the business?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, demand remains very strong. We\u2019re currently booking and billing about 8% above a year ago, and we see that trend continuing through the quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Mark. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sandra Liang from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Sandra, your line is live. Is it possible your phone may be on mute?\nMark Kowlzan: Jamie, let\u2019s move to the next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Roxland from Truist. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Roxland: Yes. Thank you, Mark, Bob, Bob and Tom for taking my questions. Congrats on a really good quarter.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you.\nBob Mundy: Thanks.\nMike Roxland: Just wanted to get a sense from you regarding the mix in 4Q. Box prices looked like they were notably down sequentially year-over-year. Now, aside from lower price, were there any one-time mix issues as well? And I recall that in 3Q, you called out weaker building products, lower graphics from softer retail, UAW strike. I\u2019m wondering if that had an impact in 4Q as well, and whether you expect that to fade in 2024.\nTom Hassfurther: Mike, our fourth Q mix was about what we expected it to be. At the end of the third quarter we had a little more graphics business that came in, which was positive. But our mix in the fourth quarter followed pretty much true to form. And going into this year, I think that with some of those headwinds that you talked about behind us, especially the destocking, which was very unpredictable that we incurred during 2023, it\u2019s kind of steady as she goes in 2024.\nMike Roxland: Got it. Thank you, Tom. So would it be fair to say that in 4Q, some of those issues you mentioned in 3Q last time continued a little bit in 4Q and that\u2026\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, they did a little bit into 4Q. They did. But then they began to settle out towards the end of the year.\nMike Roxland: Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then just of the $1.93 in lower prices and mix, is there anyway to parse how much was price versus mix? And then in terms of your \u2013 the $1.54 guide, what\u2019s embedded for price and mix separately?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s mostly price, obviously, but then it does get impacted by mix and that kind of varies back and forth. So we try to do the best we can to forecast that.\nMike Roxland: Got it. So Tom, would it be fair to say you\u2019re expecting \u2013 given destocking coming to an end, given some of these issues mentioned previously in my question. Probably you expect a better quality, a high quality mix in 2024 versus 2023.\nTom Hassfurther: I think our mix will be traditional to what we typically have.\nMike Roxland: Got it. And last question just before turning it over. Can you help us just think about what\u2019s next for PKG from a growth perspective? Obviously, you\u2019re finishing up Jackson here. And you still have I Falls. Now realizing that I Falls is a great asset, it\u2019s modern, generates a lot of cash, [indiscernible] paper. Do you expect to run I Falls as is? What\u2019s really the next leg of the growth trajectory for PKG after this?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Mike, you know, obviously you don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold. But we\u2019ve got a lot of optionality in what we\u2019re doing. All of the capital spending that we continue to do in the box plants, as an example, continues to create incredible opportunity to grow with our customers. Just this year alone, for 2024, we planned over 30 strategic projects at 26 of our box plants. And this is major converting equipment installations, corrugators, corrugator rebuilds and upgrades of significant magnitude. This past year it was the same situation. Number of evolves, rotary die cutters, corrugators, new plant in Pennsylvania, the start of a new plant out in Salt Lake City. And so we will continue to build in the internal organic capability to grow with the marketplace. Mills have the runway to continue providing that over the next few years. And then you have to assume, as we have always done, we can grow the containerboard supply as we need to, whether it\u2019s adding capacity in an existing mill or if we had to go out and buy a mill or build a mill. There\u2019s a lot of optionality in the future that we have the ability to proceed with. But that\u2019s never been an issue for us. And I don\u2019t expect it to be an issue in the future. But right now, the key is that we have tremendous capability within the converting side of the packaging unit and the mill system to provide the containerboard to grow for the next number of years. So I\u2019m very, very encouraged by where we are.\nMike Roxland: That\u2019s great, Mark and very good call. I really appreciate it. And best of luck in 2024.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Mike. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nCashen Keeler: Yes. Hi, good morning. This is actually Cashen Keeler sitting in for George. He had an internal conflict this morning. So I guess just back to the pricing discussion. Are you able to comment at all in terms of what percent of your customer base you\u2019re invoicing at those higher prices in both containerboard and boxes?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, with regard to linerboard and medium, I\u2019m talking about linerboard of medium here. It\u2019s 100% of our customers, outside customers on linerboard of medium and trade partners as well. So that\u2019s where that stands. And I just like to add, we\u2019re having no customer dispute us on these price increases or anything. And obviously we\u2019re disappointed that it didn\u2019t show up in the trade publication, as I mentioned earlier. And right now we have customers that are incredibly frustrated with the mechanism right now and feel that there\u2019s a disconnect between what they see going on in the market and what\u2019s being reported. Now maybe some of that is because the outside market has shrunk so severely that it\u2019s quite small now. And we don\u2019t want the tail wagging the dog here, but we\u2019ve got customers now both on the liner and the box side that are asking us to look for alternatives. And we\u2019ll be exploring any and all alternatives going forward, including maybe not even using an index, but we\u2019ll kind of give you some color on that going forward as that progresses. But I just wanted to make you aware of where our customer base is and how they feel about certain things at the moment.\nCashen Keeler: Okay. Appreciate that color. And then in terms of production, was the cost of production in 4Q where you had anticipated in packaging? I know you commented that you had lower operating converting costs year-over-year. But just interested if there were any items that were higher than you expected kind of in there? And as you look out for the rest of 1Q, any kind of cost items or lines that might give you pause. I know you commented the fiber and energy and chemist, but since shutdown those items.\nBob Mundy: Yes. This is Bob. I would just say, relative to 4Q, maybe OCC prices that was probably a little higher than what we had baked in. But maybe there were some, what we call, other fixed type costs around some services and equipment rentals, some outside, things like that, maybe just a touch higher. But all in, it was certainly a very good quarter from a cost perspective relative to what we had guided to. As far as the first \u2013 going to the first quarter from the fourth, there are some moving parts there. Some of them are just not what we normally see. Obviously, we pointed out the big significant change that we\u2019re being impacted by relative to the Jackson conversion, which is on a sequential basis, is $0.16 per share. But outside of that, if you look at all of our other costs, there\u2019s probably 60% or so of those are what we call seasonal or timing type cost increases. Those would be weather-related, which are actually a little more severe going 4Q to 1Q this year, because of so much cold weather down in the southern mills and the box plants, which typically we don\u2019t see much of a change relative to usages and things that get impacted by cold weather down there. And then the wages and benefits. The base \u2013 that base gets larger every year. You never have deflation with your wages and benefits. So the annual increases that we experienced going from 4Q and to start a new year in 1Q, it just gets higher and higher, the dollar impact of that. Plus this year, our medical costs alone, they were up probably over 12% to 15%. However, on a sequential basis, the weather-related items should flip back the other way as we move from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q, as should about half of the \u2013 those wage-related timing items. Those start to flip back the other way on a sequential basis. You have to sort of keep that in mind going forward. And I\u2019d say the balance of well, I guess one other item is we talked about bringing Wallula on in the first quarter and taking Jackson down, so we\u2019re replacing low-cost tons with very high cost tons. That\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s probably a $0.10 hit in and of itself right there, exclusive of the outage impact that $0.16. And then the balance of that is just inflation related things that don\u2019t get talked about a lot. For all these cost increases we incur, believe me, anyone who provides a part, a good product service to us, they\u2019re experiencing those same increases. So there\u2019s a lot of outside services, equipment rentals, rents, property taxes even. You can go on and on and on. All that is \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of money that we have to absorb especially on \u2013 you see it mostly in a sequential nature going from 4Q to 1Q. So, I hope that gives you a little color about what\u2019s in those numbers for the \u2013 for our guidance.\nCashen Keeler: Great. Thanks for the details.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabrial Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nGabrial Hajde: Mark, Tom, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nMark Kowlzan: Morning, Gabe.\nGabrial Hajde: I wanted to ask a little bit on the demand side. Historically speaking, you guys have done a good job of kind of outperforming the industry or even exceeding that kind of the GDP type growth. But this quarter was seemingly pretty pronounced relative to what we\u2019re reading maybe in the green markets report or REFI [ph]. So, I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything that you can talk about, I mean, I know historically, you guys haven\u2019t talked about like a vitality index or something like that. But just maybe new business wins that you all are excited about or change incentive structure for your sales folks to go out and win new business.\nTom Hassfurther: Gabe, the majority of our increase in volume came from our existing customers. As we\u2019ve said many, many times, I mean, that\u2019s our main growth engine. And we tried to align with the right kind of customers who, over the long haul, will grow. And I think that\u2019s been a big plus for us. Are we winning any new business? Yes. We win some new business, some other business goes the other way. It\u2019s over the \u2013 over time, we do come out ahead. But as you mentioned, I mean, historically, we have outperformed the industry, and we plan to do so going forward. But we did lag as you probably know, for a number of quarters. Over the last couple of years, there were times when we did lag. And it\u2019s because of some of the segments that we were in. And I mentioned before, as an example, I mean, building products went crazy during COVID and then suddenly that came to a screeching halt. And so some of these segments that we\u2019re in did hold us back, but they\u2019re coming back now nicely and that\u2019s a big part of our growth.\nGabrial Hajde: Okay. Thank you. And then maybe two questions on the Jackson conversion. It sounds like \u2013 I know sometimes that they\u2019re not always directly linked in terms of when the costs flow through and the guidance that you gave us, Bob, in terms of the $0.26 and the $0.16. But is that happening? Is it straddling in March, April from a timing standpoint? And then I\u2019ll ask a question. I don\u2019t know if you guys will answer, but on a sequential basis, if the $70 and $100 a ton is going through, and by our math, that\u2019s, to your point, Mark, maybe $25 a ton is being reflected in Q1, then is it fair that the extra $50 a ton incremental should be on a sequential basis embedded into the second quarter? Thank you.\nUnidentified Company Representative: [Technical Difficulty]\nTom Hassfurther: Right. Well, we\u2019re in the midst of discussing all that with our customers, especially on the box side and what the roll through will be, et cetera. So, as I mentioned, we got the increase in place for the linerboard medium. And we\u2019ll see where things roll through, but we expect it to be a traditional roll through.\nGabrial Hajde: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi Good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hey, following up on your earlier comments, I\u2019m wondering, is there some percentage of your box contracts that are not on Pulp and Paper Week? And I guess, looking at other paper grades, there were some boxboard producers we didn\u2019t feel like the index was really reflecting what was really happening in the market, and they were able to move some customers off a Pulp and Paper Week. Is that something that you potentially could do? Or you think some customers might welcome? Just wondering if you \u2013 to the extent you can discuss how you think about that?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Anthony, as I mentioned, I mean, we do have a high level of frustration both with customers, both on the liner and on the box side. With Pulp and Paper and feel that there\u2019s a disconnect there to what they see in the market and what\u2019s being reported. As I\u2019ve said for a number of years now, as this independent market continues to shrink and what we really consider to be a real open market gets into the mid-single digits. And if that\u2019s all that\u2019s being reported on, that becomes quite a \u2013 can cause that disconnect, in my opinion. So our customers have asked us to look at a lot of different alternatives in which we are doing, along with them, and we\u2019ll see where we end up. Have we moved some people off of that? We don\u2019t really like to get into those kind of details just because that\u2019s between us and our customers. So, I\u2019ll leave that one aside, because we\u2019re not going to really get into those discussions other than I just will tell you, we are looking at any and all alternatives.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just switching gears on the CapEx guidance for 2024. I think you said $470 million to $490 million CapEx. Is it possible to break that down between maintenance, discretionary and then Jackson. And is there any kind of finer point in terms of the run rate capacity add from Jackson when that conversion is completed?\nBob Mundy: Yes. As far as I would say Jackson will be $30 million to $40 million of that amount. The balance, I\u2019d say 65% or so would be sort of that nondiscretionary must-do type maintenance-type capital spending. And Mark, you talked about?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, I mean we\u2019re probably spending close to $250 million just in the box plants alone this year. And that\u2019s all of the 30 strategic projects we\u2019re working on the box plants and building the new plant out in Salt Lake City and finishing that up. And then the rest will be just in the smaller one-off projects in the mills. And then obviously, we\u2019ve got the maintenance-type capital that goes on. But the bulk of its \u2013 quite frankly, the bulk of its in the box plants. And then finish up the Jackson conversion.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. And is there a final number on the Jackson capacity add in terms of how much \u2013 how many tons that you would expect that to add when it\u2019s completed?\nMark Kowlzan: The machine certainly ought to be able to add approximately 175,000 to 200,000 more incremental tons a year when we\u2019re done with this phase of work. I believe the number for 2023 is production of that machine was somewhere around 537,000 tons of production for 2023. So if you add 200,000 more tons that you\u2019re up in that 700,000 tons capability. But again, it all depends on our demand. And so we\u2019re going to run to demand, as we always have, but that\u2019s the necessity of being able to build this runway that our customers can depend on and they know they can grow with us and we can supply them the product and the value they need. And so the Jackson machine is going to have that capability to ramp up and ramp down, and provide all the grades we need at an incredibly attractive cost position.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhil Ng: Hey guys, congrats on a really strong quarter. Your business is relatively a shorter cycle business, but it certainly seem pretty confident on the demand outlook for the first half with capacity bringing back online. What are your customers selling? Are there any pockets of end markets that kind of really stand out where you\u2019re seeing demand kind of bounce back in a bigger way? And are you seeing any restocking after a year\u2019s worth of destocking effectively?\nTom Hassfurther: Phil, I think the demand outlook obviously remains good. It\u2019s pretty much across the board. There\u2019s no one industry that stands out more than the other, other than maybe e-commerce. Because you still see the brick-and-mortar stores continue to struggle a little bit, but that\u2019s more than offset by the e-commerce side of the business. So that remains quite good. And I think relative to restocking, I would say that the restocking has been quite conservative to date. Nobody jumped up and said, \"I\u2019m going back to where I was during COVID\" or anything like that, they\u2019re trying to be reasonably conservative going forward. And \u2013 but \u2013 so I think we saw a little bit \u2013 we probably saw a little bit of a jump as a result of that, but nothing like we saw on the destocking side.\nPhil Ng: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess a question for Bob. If I look at your last two quarters, operational and converting costs were down pretty sharply, which is impressive especially with Wallula come back on. Preaching the first half of the year you\u2019re going to have some outage expense of Jackson. But some of the gains you saw in the back half, is that pretty sticky, and that\u2019s still to come? And I know you guys talked about all these different projects you guys are working on the box side of things. So kind of help us think through that driver potentially good or bad this year.\nBob Mundy: I\u2019m sorry, what did you say was sticky feel? I didn\u2019t catch that part.\nPhil Ng: The operational and converting cost, that came down pretty nicely in the back half of 2023. I\u2019m just trying to gauge should we expect follow-through in 2024, especially with some of the investments you\u2019re making in the box plants? Is that a good guy as well?\nBob Mundy: No, absolutely. I mean, as we\u2019ve said many times, that never stops. It\u2019s not just capital projects. It\u2019s things that don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s just changing behavior, a technique, a process. It doesn\u2019t cost money comparing to others new things, new technologies, new ideas, and those thousands of those things are going on every year. And that is really what drives those reductions that we\u2019ve talked about historically, and that certainly will continue in the future.\nMark Kowlzan: One good example of that, and we don\u2019t talk about a lot, our transportation capability. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve built an incredibly strong transportation logistics group within the company, and it\u2019s nationwide now. We\u2019ve got a very large fleet of tractors and trailers running the country, taking care of not only containerboard, but a lot of our packaging to the customer. And so that capability of having our own trucking in-house has provided enormous flexibility in cost management on the transportation side of the equation. So that\u2019s just one example of how we go about looking at our business and then executing.\nPhil Ng: Super. Just one last one for me. I think on the prepared remarks, you called about $1.1 billion of liquidity. Mark, you highlighted being balanced in terms of capital deployment. Any opportunities perhaps to play a little offense in a market that\u2019s a little more distressed, especially some of the capacity that\u2019s come on. Is that an opportunity? You guys are obviously growing pretty nicely and generate a ton of free cash flow here.\nMark Kowlzan: I\u2019ll let you know when it happens. That\u2019s the beauty of having that firepower. We can not only continue to look at share buyback and dividends. But if an opportunity comes up on a one-off on the packaging side to buy an existing business, we can easily move into that. If something on the mill side came up that we found attractive, we can move into that and not worry about how we finance it or how it affects the balance sheet. And so the other thing I want to remind everybody, back when we called out the 2023s capital, and we \u2013 the 2022 capital up over $800 million. And we reminded everybody that the 2022 capital would be going down into a much more manageable level, much more reasonable level in that $400 million range. Just keep in mind, we did that, and we accomplished an incredible amount of high-return projects and impact projects that benefit our customers and our shareholders alike. But also this year, we continued that trend. The $400 million range of high-return, high-impact projects affords us again an incredible opportunity with the balance sheet because all that operating cash that we\u2019re generating goes into free cash and can be deployed appropriately. And so we\u2019re in a very good place. Over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve done all the heavy lifting to get the mills and the box plants in very, very efficient condition. And so now it\u2019s much more manageable about how we go about with these projects. And so with the fact that we have the internal capability with the engineering and technology organization to manage the bulk of all this work. We\u2019re in a much better position than we\u2019ve ever been and we\u2019ll continue that. But again, all optionality is open for us on how we look at the world.\nPhil Ng: Okay. Appreciate that\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your follow up. \nMark Weintraub: Thank you. So can you share with us the types of alternatives on pricing structures that might be contemplated? Would they be more cost tied? Would they be more macro or data tied? Would it be more just going and negotiating with counterparties, some combination? Or any color as to kind of where the bias might be from your perspective?\nTom Hassfurther: Mark, it\u2019s nice that you\u2019re thinking about it, and I appreciate all your options that you just presented, but I\u2019m not going to get into that at all because, as I told you before, that\u2019s between us and our customers. And we\u2019ll work those out as we go forward. So, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t give you anything, but that\u2019s the way we do business.\nMark Weintraub: Totally understood. Is there anything that may have been missing that would have been in the list recognizing there\u2019s going to be a whole bunch of things that you\u2019re going to be talking about with your customers\u2026\nTom Hassfurther: Nice try, but I\u2019m going ditto again. Okay.\nMark Weintraub: Yes. I did try. And then Bob, you had mentioned about 60% of the costs increased from 4Q to 1Q seasonal or timing. Could you sort of put a number on that? Would that be like $0.20 per share? And if it we were just \u2013 had that 6% come back in the second quarter?\nBob Mundy: Mark, it\u2019d be closer to 35%, maybe a little more per share.\nMark Weintraub: Right. Okay. Thank you so much.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Thank you, Mark. Any other questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is also a follow-up from Gabrial Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your follow-up.\nGabrial Hajde: Tom, Mark, I\u2019m going to try one more time. So, I apologize in advance, but it\u2019s more trying to understand the thought process. And I think the price discovery process that we\u2019ve seen over the past 25 years, what we\u2019re hearing is maybe is not as bulletproof or as useful as it maybe once was. And so maybe really what we\u2019re hearing is and something I think is misunderstood in the industry, is that you guys sell boxes that are made to a spec that service a customer\u2019s needs as opposed to selling a customer a parent roll of paper. And so is it fair that maybe what\u2019s going on behind the scenes is the value that you\u2019re bringing to your customers is really what you\u2019re trying to understand and work with them to help them understand ultimately and move the pricing structure to something like that.\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Gabe, you described it very well. I got to be honest with you. There is a linerboard and medium market, and then there\u2019s a box market. And the box market is all custom-made. Lots of different things go into it, and there\u2019s a value created accordingly. So you \u2013 as I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019m not going to get into all the optionality and all those other sorts of things, those things we\u2019ll discuss with our customers. But you do describe it accurately, I think, especially from our customers\u2019 point of view, that what gets reported is quite different than what they see in the marketplace. And just as an example, I mean, even when the prices went down, over the past 18 months or so. There isn\u2019t a customer who said, I see that there\u2019s a need for that or that they saw that in the marketplace. So we\u2019ve got \u2013 what we\u2019re hearing from our customers is very different than what\u2019s getting published. And that disconnect, we\u2019ve got to figure out how to solve that disconnect, I guess, is probably the best way to put it.\nGabrial Hajde: Very much appreciated. Thank you and good luck. \nTom Hassfurther: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other questions, Jamie?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Muir-Sands from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\nCharlie Muir-Sands: Hi, Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for all the good answers so far given us a lot to think about. Just had one question on the Jackson mill. You\u2019ve obviously very helpfully quantified the temporary cost drag that we should expect in Q1 and Q2. But can you just talk about the cost benefit that we should see from the mill once it fully ramps up and perhaps contextualize how much more efficient this mill is compared with the rest of your network?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. We talked about this for the last couple of years and that when we were done with all of this work because the work that\u2019s going on that will start next month and then finish up. It\u2019s about a 58-day outage at the mill, but it involves more than just the paper machine. Once again, in and of itself is a lot of work with dryer cans real press section rebuild, but it\u2019s also power plant work. We\u2019re going to be reconfiguring a lot of the power plant steam flows, steam pressures will be \u2013 ultimately, we\u2019ll be producing more megawatts off the power plant in the back end of the mill and providing more high pressure, higher efficient steam into the paper machine. And so net-net, the mill when it\u2019s done, will have the capability to produce linerboard and be at or amongst our lowest cost in the system. So if you think about Valdosta, DeRidder and Counce, Jackson should be as good or better, quite frankly, than Counce and DeRidder. And probably get Valdosta run for its money. And so the huge opportunity is in the, in the cost savings as we go forward, that will flow through in the future. Bob, do you want to add to that?\nBob Mundy: Yes, Charlie. And what Mark is describing, if you sort of quantify that, we\u2019re looking somewhere between $35, $40 a ton once all that work is completed, and that machine is fully operational.\nCharlie Muir-Sands: Many Thanks. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other questions, please?\nOperator: And we have an additional question from Richard Bourke from Bloomberg Intelligence. Please go ahead with your question.\nRichard Bourke: Thank you for taking the time to answer my question, gentlemen. I was just wondering with your announced price increase, to be effective January 1, if you maybe saw some demand get pulled forward into the fourth quarter by customers attempting to get that price increase?\nTom Hassfurther: No, we did not see that, Richard.\nRichard Bourke: Okay. Thank you. \nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any other follow-up questions, Jamie?\nOperator: And sir at this time, I\u2019m showing no additional questions.\nMark Kowlzan: All right. Why don\u2019t we go ahead and conclude this. If there are no questions, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us on the call, and we look forward to talking with you in April. Thank you. Everybody, have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. As Mark mentioned, Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 5.1% and total shipments with one additional shipping day were up 6.9% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Versus the third quarter of 2023, shipments per day were up 5.2% and total shipments were up 3.4%, even though there was one less shipping day. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 88,000 tons above last year's fourth quarter and 17,000 tons above the third quarter of 2023. Our order backlog and containerboard cut-up remained incredibly strong throughout the quarter. Although demand continues to be challenged by persistent inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, we expect our shipments to continue this positive momentum as we enter the first half of 2024. Relative to the published reductions in the industry benchmark grades that occurred in 2023, Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.73 per share below the fourth quarter of 2022 and down $0.40 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2023, which included a richer mix of graphics and point-of-purchase display business. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.20 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and down $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2023. Beginning January 1, 2024, we began invoicing a $70 per ton price increase for linerboard and $100 per ton increase for medium according to our recent price announcement. As you are probably aware, this past Friday, the RISI Pulp and Paper Week publication did not recognize any increase in the industry's benchmark prices for either linerboard or medium. I'm sure you will have some questions for us on this topic, and we'll be happy to discuss them with you shortly. I'll turn it back to Mark. Yes, Mark, this Tom. Yes, it's slightly above the $20. We've got the follow through on that published $20 down. And as I said, we put the linerboard of medium price increase into effect January 1. And we're invoicing accordingly and getting paid accordingly. And I might also add that as a net buyer, we also have accepted the $70 increase on the buy side and have been paying invoices accordingly. Yes, you're pretty much right. And you got to also think about it is, is the $20 is factoring into the box business right now given contract triggers. Yes, demand remains very strong. We're currently booking and billing about 8% above a year ago, and we see that trend continuing through the quarter. Thank you. Mike, our fourth Q mix was about what we expected it to be. At the end of the third quarter we had a little more graphics business that came in, which was positive. But our mix in the fourth quarter followed pretty much true to form. And going into this year, I think that with some of those headwinds that you talked about behind us, especially the destocking, which was very unpredictable that we incurred during 2023, it's kind of steady as she goes in 2024. Yes, they did a little bit into 4Q. They did. But then they began to settle out towards the end of the year. Well, I think it's \u2013 I mean, it's mostly price, obviously, but then it does get impacted by mix and that kind of varies back and forth. So we try to do the best we can to forecast that. I think our mix will be traditional to what we typically have. Well, with regard to linerboard and medium, I'm talking about linerboard of medium here. It's 100% of our customers, outside customers on linerboard of medium and trade partners as well. So that's where that stands. And I just like to add, we're having no customer dispute us on these price increases or anything. And obviously we're disappointed that it didn't show up in the trade publication, as I mentioned earlier. And right now we have customers that are incredibly frustrated with the mechanism right now and feel that there's a disconnect between what they see going on in the market and what's being reported. Now maybe some of that is because the outside market has shrunk so severely that it's quite small now. And we don't want the tail wagging the dog here, but we've got customers now both on the liner and the box side that are asking us to look for alternatives. And we'll be exploring any and all alternatives going forward, including maybe not even using an index, but we'll kind of give you some color on that going forward as that progresses. But I just wanted to make you aware of where our customer base is and how they feel about certain things at the moment. Gabe, the majority of our increase in volume came from our existing customers. As we've said many, many times, I mean, that's our main growth engine. And we tried to align with the right kind of customers who, over the long haul, will grow. And I think that's been a big plus for us. Are we winning any new business? Yes. We win some new business, some other business goes the other way. It's over the \u2013 over time, we do come out ahead. But as you mentioned, I mean, historically, we have outperformed the industry, and we plan to do so going forward. But we did lag as you probably know, for a number of quarters. Over the last couple of years, there were times when we did lag. And it's because of some of the segments that we were in. And I mentioned before, as an example, I mean, building products went crazy during COVID and then suddenly that came to a screeching halt. And so some of these segments that we're in did hold us back, but they're coming back now nicely and that's a big part of our growth. Right. Well, we're in the midst of discussing all that with our customers, especially on the box side and what the roll through will be, et cetera. So, as I mentioned, we got the increase in place for the linerboard medium. And we'll see where things roll through, but we expect it to be a traditional roll through. Well, Anthony, as I mentioned, I mean, we do have a high level of frustration both with customers, both on the liner and on the box side. With Pulp and Paper and feel that there's a disconnect there to what they see in the market and what's being reported. As I've said for a number of years now, as this independent market continues to shrink and what we really consider to be a real open market gets into the mid-single digits. And if that's all that's being reported on, that becomes quite a \u2013 can cause that disconnect, in my opinion. So our customers have asked us to look at a lot of different alternatives in which we are doing, along with them, and we'll see where we end up. Have we moved some people off of that? We don't really like to get into those kind of details just because that's between us and our customers. So, I'll leave that one aside, because we're not going to really get into those discussions other than I just will tell you, we are looking at any and all alternatives. Phil, I think the demand outlook obviously remains good. It's pretty much across the board. There's no one industry that stands out more than the other, other than maybe e-commerce. Because you still see the brick-and-mortar stores continue to struggle a little bit, but that's more than offset by the e-commerce side of the business. So that remains quite good. And I think relative to restocking, I would say that the restocking has been quite conservative to date. Nobody jumped up and said, \"I'm going back to where I was during COVID\" or anything like that, they're trying to be reasonably conservative going forward. And \u2013 but \u2013 so I think we saw a little bit \u2013 we probably saw a little bit of a jump as a result of that, but nothing like we saw on the destocking side. Mark, it's nice that you're thinking about it, and I appreciate all your options that you just presented, but I'm not going to get into that at all because, as I told you before, that's between us and our customers. And we'll work those out as we go forward. So, I'm sorry, I can't give you anything, but that's the way we do business. Nice try, but I'm going ditto again. Okay. Well, Gabe, you described it very well. I got to be honest with you. There is a linerboard and medium market, and then there's a box market. And the box market is all custom-made. Lots of different things go into it, and there's a value created accordingly. So you \u2013 as I've said before, I'm not going to get into all the optionality and all those other sorts of things, those things we'll discuss with our customers. But you do describe it accurately, I think, especially from our customers' point of view, that what gets reported is quite different than what they see in the marketplace. And just as an example, I mean, even when the prices went down, over the past 18 months or so. There isn't a customer who said, I see that there's a need for that or that they saw that in the marketplace. So we've got \u2013 what we're hearing from our customers is very different than what's getting published. And that disconnect, we've got to figure out how to solve that disconnect, I guess, is probably the best way to put it. Thank you. No, we did not see that, Richard."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I will begin the call with an overview of the fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. After they're done, I'll wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2023 net income of $189 million or $2.10 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2023 net income was $192 million or $2.13 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022's net income of $215 million or $2.35 per share. Fourth quarter net sales were $1.94 billion in 2023 and $1.98 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items was $394 million in 2023 and $409 million in 2022. Excluding the special items, we also reported full year 2023 earnings of $784 million or $8.70 per share compared to the 2022 earnings of $1.04 billion or $11.14 per share. Net sales were $7.8 billion in 2023 and $8.5 billion in 2022. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2023 was $1.6 billion compared to the $1.9 billion in 2022. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income included special items primarily for certain costs at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper-to-containerboard conversion-related activities and the closure and other costs related to corrugated products facilities and design center. Details of all special items for the year 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.22 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2023 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix of $1.93 in the Packaging segment, lower prices and mix $0.04, and volume $0.03 in the Paper segment and higher depreciation expense $0.10. These items were partially offset by very good volume in the Packaging segment of $1.07 per share. We also had lower operating and converting costs of $0.51 driven by very good process efficiencies and control over other usages of fiber, chemicals, energy, materials and labor as well as lower energy and wood fiber prices. In addition, we had lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.19, lower freight and logistics expenses $0.03, lower other expenses $0.04 and a lower share count resulting from share repurchases $0.04. The results were $0.37 above the fourth quarter guidance of $1.76 per share, primarily due to higher volumes in our Packaging segment, lower operating and converting costs, lower freight and logistics expenses. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2023 of $385 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $392 million and sales of $1.8 billion and also a 21.7% margin. For the full year 2023, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding special items was $1.6 billion with sales of $7.1 billion or 21.8% margin compared to the full year 2022 EBITDA of $1.8 billion with sales of $7.8 billion or a 23.8% margin. Throughout the quarter, demand in the Packaging segment was stronger than our expectations. This higher volume along with the operational benefits of our capital spending program and continued emphasis on cost management and process efficiencies across the entire manufacturing and converting facility system drove operating and converting costs lower as well. We had an excellent restart of the Wallula, Washington mill and the No. 3 machine during the latter part of October and ran exceptionally well during the November, December period. And that helped us meet the stronger demand and build some needed inventory during the quarter to ensure the customers \u2013 that our customers were supplied with their needs. We plan to restart the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill in this first quarter to help manage our expectations in the first half of 2024 for continued strong demand together with scheduled mill maintenance outages and the final phase of the containerboard conversion of the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business. Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $35 million with sales of $144 million or a 24.5% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2022's EBITDA of $39 million and sales of $154 million or 25.7% margin. For the full year 2023, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items was $151 million with sales of $595 million or a record 25.3% margin compared to the full year 2022 EBITDA of $132 million with sales of $622 million or a 21.3% margin. Prices and mix were down 3% from last year's fourth quarter and from the third quarter of 2023, driven by the declines in the index prices that occurred during the year. Although, slightly better than our fourth quarter guidance, sales volume was 3% below last year's fourth quarter and down approximately 6% versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2023. The management team and all the employees of our paper business have done a tremendous job over the last several quarters to optimize our inventory and product mix, and remain focused on efficient and cost-effective operations in order to continue delivering outstanding results during 2023. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. I'm very proud of the outstanding results PCA delivered in 2023 under very challenging demand conditions. We successfully completed numerous cost reduction and process improvement projects along with other key strategic initiatives at the containerboard mills and corrugated products plants. Our dedicated sales and customer service organizations continue to be extremely motivated and understanding the business of our customers. They were very responsive to our customers' needs and works proactively to help them with their solutions to their opportunities and their challenges. These combined efforts allowed us to enhance our entire packaging business and deliver profitable growth opportunities for our customers and shareholders now and into the future. 2023 also saw our paper business deliver record margins reflecting the capabilities of our employees to optimize our product mix, inventory, distribution channels and overhead structure, along with running very efficient manufacturing operations. These accomplishments helped us to achieve a new all-time annual record free cash flow. We ended the year with over $1.1 billion of liquidity and extended the overall average debt maturity to almost 16 years. We continued our commitment to a strong balance sheet and a balanced approach towards capital allocation. This allows us to profitably grow the company and to maximize returns for our shareholders, while maintaining the financial flexibility to react quickly to situations and opportunities. None of these things would be possible without the hard work of the talented employees and strong partnerships we've built with our customers and suppliers over many, many years. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter, as Tom indicated in our Packaging segment, we expect continued positive momentum in demand, along with two additional shipping days in the first quarter to drive higher total corrugated product shipments. Despite restarting the No. 2 machine at the Wallula mill, containerboard volume will be lower due to the downtime associated with the conversion of the No. 3 machine at the Jackson mill and a scheduled maintenance outage at the Counce, Tennessee mill. Prices and mix should be slightly higher with the implementation of our announced January price increases partially offset by a decrease in the published benchmark prices that occurred late in 2023 with export prices fairly flat. In our Paper segment, we expect an improved mix to move prices slightly higher with flat sales volume. Recycled fiber and energy prices will be higher and unusually cold seasonal weather will negatively impact usages and yields for energy, wood and chemicals, along with higher operating costs associated with the restart of the full operations at the Wallula mill compared to the fourth quarter operations. Labor and benefits costs will have seasonal timing related increases that occur at the beginning of a new year related to annual wage and benefit increases, the restart of payroll taxes and share-based compensation expenses. And finally, as Bob mentioned, scheduled outage expenses will include the significant first quarter impact of the conversion outage at the Jackson mill, which is estimated to be $0.16 per share. Considering these items, we expect the first quarter earnings of $1.54 per share. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions. And we can proceed as you call it out. Thanks, Jamie. Thank you, Mark. Next question. Jamie, let's move to the next question. Yes. Mike, you know, obviously you don't know what the future is going to hold. But we've got a lot of optionality in what we're doing. All of the capital spending that we continue to do in the box plants, as an example, continues to create incredible opportunity to grow with our customers. Just this year alone, for 2024, we planned over 30 strategic projects at 26 of our box plants. And this is major converting equipment installations, corrugators, corrugator rebuilds and upgrades of significant magnitude. This past year it was the same situation. Number of evolves, rotary die cutters, corrugators, new plant in Pennsylvania, the start of a new plant out in Salt Lake City. And so we will continue to build in the internal organic capability to grow with the marketplace. Mills have the runway to continue providing that over the next few years. And then you have to assume, as we have always done, we can grow the containerboard supply as we need to, whether it's adding capacity in an existing mill or if we had to go out and buy a mill or build a mill. There's a lot of optionality in the future that we have the ability to proceed with. But that's never been an issue for us. And I don't expect it to be an issue in the future. But right now, the key is that we have tremendous capability within the converting side of the packaging unit and the mill system to provide the containerboard to grow for the next number of years. So I'm very, very encouraged by where we are. Thanks, Mike. Next question. Next question please. Morning, Gabe. Thank you. Next question please. Good morning, Anthony. Yes, I mean we're probably spending close to $250 million just in the box plants alone this year. And that's all of the 30 strategic projects we're working on the box plants and building the new plant out in Salt Lake City and finishing that up. And then the rest will be just in the smaller one-off projects in the mills. And then obviously, we've got the maintenance-type capital that goes on. But the bulk of its \u2013 quite frankly, the bulk of its in the box plants. And then finish up the Jackson conversion. The machine certainly ought to be able to add approximately 175,000 to 200,000 more incremental tons a year when we're done with this phase of work. I believe the number for 2023 is production of that machine was somewhere around 537,000 tons of production for 2023. So if you add 200,000 more tons that you're up in that 700,000 tons capability. But again, it all depends on our demand. And so we're going to run to demand, as we always have, but that's the necessity of being able to build this runway that our customers can depend on and they know they can grow with us and we can supply them the product and the value they need. And so the Jackson machine is going to have that capability to ramp up and ramp down, and provide all the grades we need at an incredibly attractive cost position. Okay. Next question please. One good example of that, and we don't talk about a lot, our transportation capability. Over the last decade, we've built an incredibly strong transportation logistics group within the company, and it's nationwide now. We've got a very large fleet of tractors and trailers running the country, taking care of not only containerboard, but a lot of our packaging to the customer. And so that capability of having our own trucking in-house has provided enormous flexibility in cost management on the transportation side of the equation. So that's just one example of how we go about looking at our business and then executing. I'll let you know when it happens. That's the beauty of having that firepower. We can not only continue to look at share buyback and dividends. But if an opportunity comes up on a one-off on the packaging side to buy an existing business, we can easily move into that. If something on the mill side came up that we found attractive, we can move into that and not worry about how we finance it or how it affects the balance sheet. And so the other thing I want to remind everybody, back when we called out the 2023s capital, and we \u2013 the 2022 capital up over $800 million. And we reminded everybody that the 2022 capital would be going down into a much more manageable level, much more reasonable level in that $400 million range. Just keep in mind, we did that, and we accomplished an incredible amount of high-return projects and impact projects that benefit our customers and our shareholders alike. But also this year, we continued that trend. The $400 million range of high-return, high-impact projects affords us again an incredible opportunity with the balance sheet because all that operating cash that we're generating goes into free cash and can be deployed appropriately. And so we're in a very good place. Over the last 10 years, we've done all the heavy lifting to get the mills and the box plants in very, very efficient condition. And so now it's much more manageable about how we go about with these projects. And so with the fact that we have the internal capability with the engineering and technology organization to manage the bulk of all this work. We're in a much better position than we've ever been and we'll continue that. But again, all optionality is open for us on how we look at the world. Thank you. Next question? Okay. Thank you, Mark. Any other questions, please? Thank you. Any other questions, Jamie? Yes. We talked about this for the last couple of years and that when we were done with all of this work because the work that's going on that will start next month and then finish up. It's about a 58-day outage at the mill, but it involves more than just the paper machine. Once again, in and of itself is a lot of work with dryer cans real press section rebuild, but it's also power plant work. We're going to be reconfiguring a lot of the power plant steam flows, steam pressures will be \u2013 ultimately, we'll be producing more megawatts off the power plant in the back end of the mill and providing more high pressure, higher efficient steam into the paper machine. And so net-net, the mill when it's done, will have the capability to produce linerboard and be at or amongst our lowest cost in the system. So if you think about Valdosta, DeRidder and Counce, Jackson should be as good or better, quite frankly, than Counce and DeRidder. And probably get Valdosta run for its money. And so the huge opportunity is in the, in the cost savings as we go forward, that will flow through in the future. Bob, do you want to add to that? Thank you. Any other questions, please? Thank you. Any other follow-up questions, Jamie? All right. Why don't we go ahead and conclude this. If there are no questions, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us on the call, and we look forward to talking with you in April. Thank you. Everybody, have a good day."

            "content": "Thanks Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $335 million and free cash flow was $194 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $141 million, dividend payments of $112 million, cash tax payments of $59 million and net interest payments of $26 million. For the full year 2023, cash from operations was $1.3 billion with capital spending of $470 million and free cash flow, a record $845 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate for 2023 was 24.5%. During the fourth quarter, we issued $400 million of new 10-year notes. The proceeds from these notes will be used to redeem our $400 million notes that mature in September of 2024. Our net debt is not affected by this transaction and the proceeds from this issuance will be invested in marketable securities at an interest rate exceeding that of the new notes. The new bonds raised our overall fixed interest rate by approximately 30 basis points and extended the overall average maturity of our debt portfolio from 14.1 years to 15.6 years. Excluding the proceeds from this transaction, our year-end cash on-hand balance, including marketable securities, was just over $800 million, with liquidity of $1.1 billion. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be in the range of $470 million to $490 million. And DD&A is expected to be approximately $530 million. We estimate dividend payments of $450 million and cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $27 million. Our full year interest expense in 2024 is expected to be approximately $53 million and net cash interest payments should be about $60 million. The estimate for our 2024 book effective tax rate is 25%. Currently, planned annual outages at our mills in 2024 including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs is expected to total $0.96 per share. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2024 is $0.26 per share in the first quarter, $0.16 in the second, $0.19 in the third and $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter. These expenses include the volume and cost impact that will be incurred during the completion of the final phase of converting the No. 3 machine at the Jackson mill to containerboard during the first and second quarters. This will negatively impact our first quarter results by approximately $0.16 per share and our second quarter results by $0.08 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Thanks. Yes. This is Bob. I would just say, relative to 4Q, maybe OCC prices that was probably a little higher than what we had baked in. But maybe there were some, what we call, other fixed type costs around some services and equipment rentals, some outside, things like that, maybe just a touch higher. But all in, it was certainly a very good quarter from a cost perspective relative to what we had guided to. As far as the first \u2013 going to the first quarter from the fourth, there are some moving parts there. Some of them are just not what we normally see. Obviously, we pointed out the big significant change that we're being impacted by relative to the Jackson conversion, which is on a sequential basis, is $0.16 per share. But outside of that, if you look at all of our other costs, there's probably 60% or so of those are what we call seasonal or timing type cost increases. Those would be weather-related, which are actually a little more severe going 4Q to 1Q this year, because of so much cold weather down in the southern mills and the box plants, which typically we don't see much of a change relative to usages and things that get impacted by cold weather down there. And then the wages and benefits. The base \u2013 that base gets larger every year. You never have deflation with your wages and benefits. So the annual increases that we experienced going from 4Q and to start a new year in 1Q, it just gets higher and higher, the dollar impact of that. Plus this year, our medical costs alone, they were up probably over 12% to 15%. However, on a sequential basis, the weather-related items should flip back the other way as we move from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q, as should about half of the \u2013 those wage-related timing items. Those start to flip back the other way on a sequential basis. You have to sort of keep that in mind going forward. And I'd say the balance of well, I guess one other item is we talked about bringing Wallula on in the first quarter and taking Jackson down, so we're replacing low-cost tons with very high cost tons. That's a \u2013 that's probably a $0.10 hit in and of itself right there, exclusive of the outage impact that $0.16. And then the balance of that is just inflation related things that don't get talked about a lot. For all these cost increases we incur, believe me, anyone who provides a part, a good product service to us, they're experiencing those same increases. So there's a lot of outside services, equipment rentals, rents, property taxes even. You can go on and on and on. All that is \u2013 it's a lot of money that we have to absorb especially on \u2013 you see it mostly in a sequential nature going from 4Q to 1Q. So, I hope that gives you a little color about what's in those numbers for the \u2013 for our guidance. Yes. As far as I would say Jackson will be $30 million to $40 million of that amount. The balance, I'd say 65% or so would be sort of that nondiscretionary must-do type maintenance-type capital spending. And Mark, you talked about? I'm sorry, what did you say was sticky feel? I didn't catch that part. No, absolutely. I mean, as we've said many times, that never stops. It's not just capital projects. It's things that don't \u2013 it's just changing behavior, a technique, a process. It doesn't cost money comparing to others new things, new technologies, new ideas, and those thousands of those things are going on every year. And that is really what drives those reductions that we've talked about historically, and that certainly will continue in the future. Mark, it'd be closer to 35%, maybe a little more per share. Yes, Charlie. And what Mark is describing, if you sort of quantify that, we're looking somewhere between $35, $40 a ton once all that work is completed, and that machine is fully operational."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Packaging Corporation of America's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. Your host for today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. Please note that this call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you're ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO, PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business, and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details and then I'll wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday we reported third quarter net income of $183 million or $2.03 per share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2023 net income was $185 million or $2.05 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2022's net income of $266 million or $2.83 per share. Third quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2023 and $2.1 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding special items was $388 million in 2023 and $477 million in 2022. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to container board conversion related activities. Details of all special items for the third quarter of 2023, as well as 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.78 per share decrease in third quarter 2023 earnings, compared to the third quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower price and mix of $1.33 and volume $0.09 in the packaging segments. Higher depreciation expense $0.11; lower volume in the paper segment $0.04; higher tax $0.02; and other expenses $0.02 cents. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.58, primarily resulting from lower recycled fiber and energy prices along with outstanding mill and plant operational execution. Other favorable items included a lower share count resulting from share repurchases in the second half of 2022 were $0.11, higher prices and mix in the paper segment $0.04, lower converting costs $0.04, lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.04, and lower freight and logistics expenses $0.02. The results were $0.17 above our third quarter guidance of $1.88 per share primarily due to higher volume in the packaging and paper segments and lower operating and converting costs. Looking at our packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter of 2023 of $374 million, with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 21.3% versus last year's EBITDA of $467 million, with sales of $1.9 billion, and a 24.1% margin. The operational benefits of our capital spending program and the continued great focus and execution of our mills and corrugated products facilities on numerous process improvement initiatives once again delivered impressive results. This included areas such as machine and equipment efficiencies, fiber, chemical and material usages, internal energy generation and usage, and labor costs. Our approach to cost-effective management of container board supply with demand also delivered the benefits we were anticipating. This was primarily achieved by idling the Wallula mill for the entire quarter, which resulted in a market-related downtime of approximately 174,000 tons. However, with the stronger demand in our packaging segment, we ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than anticipated. Based on our current outlook for improved demand, together with current plans for the first quarter of 2024 for the scheduled mill maintenance outages and completing the final phase of the container board conversion on the number three machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. We are planning to restart the number three machine at the Wallula, Washington mill during the fourth quarter in order to bring our inventories to desired levels. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on container board sales in the corrugated business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 1.9% and total shipments with two less shipping days were down 1.3%, compared to last year's third quarter. Versus the second quarter of 2023, shipments per day were up 3.9% and total shipments were up 2.3% even though there was one less shipping day. Outside sales volume of container board was 33,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 5,000 tons above the second quarter of 2023. Demand headwinds from a shift of consumer buying preferences towards more service-oriented spending, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and non-durable goods. However, we mentioned last quarter that many customers were telling us the inventory de-stocking of boxes and their products was behind them and we were hopeful that, that would translate to improving volume throughout the second-half of the year. We saw that occurring during the third quarter and we expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter although there is one less shipping day, compared to the third quarter. Relative to the published reductions in the industry benchmark grades that occurred late last year and earlier this year, domestic container board and corrugated products prices and mixed together were $1.12 per share below the third quarter of 2022, and down $0.45 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Export container board prices and mix were down $0.21 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2022 and down $0.03 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2023. And now I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Tom. Looking at our paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $35 million with sales of $158 million or a 22.4% margin, compared to the third quarter of 2022\u2019s EBITDA of $33 million and sales of $165 million or a 19.7% margin. Seasonally stronger cut size and printing and converting volumes were 13% higher than the second quarter levels and down almost 8% versus the third quarter \u201822 with about 40% of the decline being driven by no paper sales from our Jackson mill in this year's third quarter. Prices and mix were up about 3.5% from last year's third quarter and down 2% from the second quarter of 2023, due to the declines in the index prices that occurred earlier in the year. Our International Falls mill managed their nine-day planned maintenance outage very well, and similar to the packaging facilities, the mill remained focused on efficient and cost-effective operations, delivering great results for the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $339 million, with free cash flow of $250 million. The more significant cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $90 million, common stock dividends totaled $112 million, $63 million for federal and state income tax payments, and $51 million for pension and other post-employment benefit contributions. In addition, we repurchased just over 286,000 shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $144.81 per share for a total of about $42 million. We ended the quarter with $726 million of cash, including marketable securities and our liquidity on September 30th was approximately $1.1 billion. Lastly, our planned annual maintenance outage expense for the third quarter was just over $0.22 per share and the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $0.19, bringing the 2023 full year total to $0.72 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead as we move forward into the -- from the third into the fourth quarter, in our packaging segment we expect less market-related downtime as we build our inventories back to appropriate levels, along with higher shipments per day in our corrugated products facilities, although our plans will have one less shipping day, compared to the third quarter. We also expect lower average prices primarily due to the majority of the May decrease in the published benchmark index grades being realized throughout the third quarter, as well as a seasonally less rich mix. In our paper segment, volume will be lower compared to the seasonally stronger third quarter and prices and mix are assumed to trend lower with declines in the index prices. Operating and converting costs will increase -- driven by higher recycled fiber prices, seasonal energy costs, and the restart of the wool of the mill. Depreciation expense is estimated to be slightly higher and scheduled maintenance outage expenses will be lower. Considering all of these items, we expect the fourth quarter earnings of $1.76 per share. With that, I would be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K and the subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to go ahead and open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Garrison Keillor from Bank of America securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, it's George Staphos. How are you everybody? Congratulations on the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, George.\nGeorge Staphos: I just -- how are you doing? Doing dueling conference calls today at this time. So again, congratulations on the performance. Can you talk to the -- you enumerated a number of factors in terms of the lower operating and converting costs. I know, Mark, it's always a number of projects, but were there any in particular that were sources of the improved performance? Yes, there's going to be some pickup in the fourth quarter seasonally and you have OCC higher, but how much do you carry forward and what's the room for further improvement on both operating and converting costs as we look out to \u201824 from where we're at right now. If you can talk a little bit to that.\nMark Kowlzan: You know, it's the benefit of the year-after-year continuous improvement that we've had in place. And as we've said over the years, we're constantly doing hundreds and hundreds of projects a year. Some are small, some are large, but nevertheless it's an ongoing, continuous process across the board. And if you think about the box plants and the mills, there's a daily activity with the technology organization in concert with the local operational management focused clearly on cost takeout and just operational excellence. And this has been going on for a number of years and will continue to go on. Tom, I think, you know, you've got great examples in the box plants that we just continue to execute.\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, I think George, this is really, you know, an effort to really realize the deployment of the capital that we've done in the -- in all the box plants and to streamline those box plants and to really get those box plants, you know, right-sized for the growth we've got coming and what the existing volume is right now. So we're very pleased. We're very, very pleased with the results.\nMark Kowlzan: You know, George, as far as next year, you know, as you could expect, we're already and have been talking about, you know, what's on the horizon for next year, what are the opportunities. And so we've got a very good, solid plan in place on where we're going after these cost takeouts and continued operational improvements, along with just being able to look at what the market requirements are going to be in terms of customer needs and addressing that. And while we address that, we're always looking at how we're deploying that capital and how that impacts the operation in terms of labor cost and energy and input conversion cost. So we've got a good plan for next year also.\nGeorge Staphos: Sounds like it wouldn't be surprised by that Mark. So to Wallula, and again I know it's hard to talk about some of this live mic. But the restart for the fourth quarter, what does it mean about what your customers are saying for \u201824? I realize you need to rebuild inventories and we know PM3 at Jackson's going to be down for the last part of the conversion. But what does it mean in terms of your demand outlook, what your customers are saying? And hopefully this isn't the case, but if things wind up being from a macro standpoint a little bit softer, how quickly could you maybe pull back on Wallula if need be? And then my last question I'll turn over. Can you talk to us a bit about how your early fourth quarter bookings and billings are? And how we should again think about how those map to actual volumes. Thanks and good luck in the quarter, guys.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, George. Yes, you know, as far as Wallula, as we've always said, we're going to run to demand. And Wallula is just one of the opportunities we have to move the needle on our needs. And so by getting number three started up, you know, over the course of the next couple of weeks, it will fulfill our current needs. And we'll anticipate that through next year. If demand just holds on the trajectory that it is right now, we'll need Wallula running through the year and so we will look at the opportunity to supply the marketplace. We've got our own internal targets on what we want our inventories to be to minimize transportation and logistics issues. But we can flex the system up and down and as we always have, we will always run to demand. So that's how I'll answer that. And then Tom, why don't you go into the current box cut-up?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, let me first just kind of tag along with what Mark just said relative to running to demand. You know, that is what we do. And if we didn't have the demand, we wouldn't be talking about restarting Wallula, pure and simple. Now to calibrate that a little bit, George, I think you need to really look at our low point was the first quarter of 2023 in terms of demand. Our demand currently is, you know, just in a couple of quarters is now 8% higher than that number and going higher going forward. So, you know, that's the real reason why we need the, you know, the cut up in -- at Wallula. It's really being driven on the box side of the business more so than anything else. And relative to the bookings and the billings, again, our bookings are up 14% for this at the beginning. And again that\u2019s, you know, you've got to take that number, because we've had high numbers and then we come in a little low, you know, we come in significantly lower for the actual quarter, because a lot of these bookings are for quite a ways out. But I think the key here is that the backlog remains incredibly strong, and our cut-up demand is also very strong. So we feel very good about where we are on the fourth quarter and certainly entering into next year.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you very much.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. Tom, just following up, you mentioned an 8% reference to your demand now versus, I think, first quarter. So is that sort of what you're expecting in the fourth quarter on an average day basis? Because I was sort of trying to do a little bit math and again, is that how to think what that number you just mentioned?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, Mark. I mean, our trend still remains positive. So we'll be up. And again, I think it's really important to get calibrated kind of the correct way to some extent. And because when we look at the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201822, in \u201822 we had an extra day in there given the way the FBA holidays fell. So we were actually up a couple of percent in the fourth quarter of \u201822 over the third quarter of \u201822. And -- but then, of course, in the first quarter of \u201823 is when we really hit what I call rock bottom in terms of demand. And as I said, so we're up just in a couple of quarters, 8%, and we look at that number going up again in the fourth quarter.\nMark Weintraub: Got it. Okay, thank you. And just on the Jackson project, could you just remind us what the end result is going to be? Is it happening in the fourth quarter and the first quarter? And, okay just color on that would be great?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, no, you know, the work will be done next year, late first quarter into the second quarter. It's a longer outage, but it will be the final phase of the completion work necessary to take care of the big machine. But you're talking about \u201823 additional high-pressure dryer cans, modifying the press section, we\u2019re removing the fourth press, installing the new shoe press, a number of modifications in that regard to enhance the speed, the drying capability. But it's that final phase that gets the productivity up, but also some of the work in the back end of the mill is related to the cost position of the mill. So when this work is done, depending on the demand coming out of that mill, that mill will be, as far as cost competitive position, it will be right in there with the DeRidder and Counce in Valdosta.\nMark Weintraub: Great. And if you just remind, I think it was like a 265,000 ton per year, this part, or correct me what that number was and if there's a way for it to calibrate the amount of cost per ton or whatever the best way to look at it, what you're expecting to achieve with this last phase would be helpful too?\nMark Kowlzan: You know, I'm not going to answer that right now, because I don't want to say the wrong thing. I'm going to let Bob, if he recalls, but at the end of the day, the machine, you know, if you think about where we've been running the machine on a daily basis, you know, the machine's been flexing anywhere from 1,200 tons a day to 1,800 tons a day, depending on what we needed. But when we're done with this project, the capability of that machine will be well over 2,000 tons a day. The target is 2,400 tons a day when we're done with this. So if you use a 352 day a year, you'll get your annual tons.\nBob Mundy: Yes, Mark, and the improvement from where we are today versus where we will be when we hit that run rate after the completion of the second phase, it's close to $40 a ton. That benefit coming from most of your direct variable type costs and you're getting all this additional volume with no increases in your, obviously indirect costs or any fixed costs. So you get a nice, huge benefit once this project is completed.\nMark Weintraub: Great. And so we can just take the 2,400 times 350 or whatever, or 360.\nMark Kowlzan: Just for simple math, you can, whether you use 2,000 or 2,200, but the ultimate goal between myself and some of the people around me is that machine will be a 2,400 ton a day machine someday when we're done fine tuning it. But it would be -- to my knowledge, it would be the most productive, low-cost, linerboard machine in the Western Hemisphere.\nMark Weintraub: Super. One last quick one. I'm curious, was mix much of a factor in terms of the 133, I guess, is 112 domestic. But was mix much of a factor in the corrugated? Or was that just mostly price?\nTom Hassfurther: No. Mix is a big factor in there, both in end uses and in basis weights. So it's there's a heck of a lot that goes into what the final pricing is. And as I mentioned last time, and I'll just mention it again, building products, that's still -- that segment, which is a good segment for us, still remains underwater as housing starts have been affected by higher interest rates. The graphics mix and the effect of what's going on and the changes that are taking place in brick-and-mortar stores, that's been impacted. And of course, our automotive segment with the UAW strike is now really starting to get impacted. Now all of those segments tend to be on the higher price side. However, we've got a lot of other segments that are doing quite well. And we're -- and we've been -- and we haven't been impacted much at all other than what you've seen in the publications in terms of price.\nMark Weintraub: Okay, super. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Roxland from Truist. Please go ahead with your question.\nMike Roxland: Thank you, Mark, and Bob for taking my questions. Congrats on another solid quarter despite tough environment.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Roxland: Just kind of a little bit more -- I wonder if you could provide a little more color just about the cadence of shipments during the quarter. Just a little more color on laboring upon, I should say. Some of the different end markets, some good color before on the prior question on building products in the automotive segment, but anything you could provide as to you maybe some the cadence during the quarter? And what end markets really showed some significant growth as the quarter progressed?\nTom Hassfurther: End markets. And then when things started picking up. Yes, yes. Okay, well. Mike, I kind of -- I think, I got most of what you're asking here, but outside of those markets that I mentioned, one other market that I had mentioned prior was the ag business and told you that we had a lot of headwinds in ag, especially weather-related, those have pretty much dissipated, and we're looking for a very good ag season coming up, so that's going to be a lift. Of course, e-com has continues to kind of take a little bit of a larger share of the corrugated business, and that looks very good. And in general, I mean, we're selling a lot of food and beverage and all sorts of other segments. And those segments either remain very steady or have look good going forward. And I think the best news is it's becoming more predictable now given the fact that we've gotten all of this inventory and destocking out of the way, and our customers are operating quite lean at the moment. And so it's a lot easier to predict what's happening in a number of these segments. I hope that answers your question.\nMike Roxland: It does. Very helpful. Thank you. And as you think about bringing back Wallula, can you talk about any headwinds that any of your other mills might face? I recall that last quarter, you mentioned -- now because of Wallula being down, you were able to optimize production at your remaining mills achieving $150 per ton benefit. So any headwinds that you could expect or anticipate or your other mills once fully up and running?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, no, again, currently, because of the inventory situation, we'll have to run the entire mill system to capacity. And so the six mills that ran during the third quarter, we'll have to continue running full out, and then Wallula number three, we'll have to come up and perform equally as efficiently.\nMike Roxland: One final question, I guess, squeezing in here. Mark, can you help us think about how you're thinking of growing the business once you're past the phase, the conversion of number three in Jackson next year, where does growth come from mix? Is the conversion of I Falls, the resumption of M&A? How should we think about you growing the business, let's say, post 2024.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, if you look at over the decades, we've always grown with our customers. And we still have the most diverse, broad book of business nationwide with local accounts and we'll continue to grow with those accounts and help enhance their business. And so that's where a lot of the opportunity always comes from. Tom, do you want to elaborate on that?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think in addition, I think that as I mentioned, these segments that are down, those segments are going to come back. So they're going to show back up. And we'll continue to -- what we think is operate, you know, demonstrate the best value in the marketplace to an entire customer base and be able to grow our business accordingly as well. So we'll -- we're constantly looking outward to see what's possible and what those demands look like and working very closely with our customers, and we want to make sure we're well aligned. That's what's driving the whole Wallula project at the moment.\nMike Roxland: Got it. Thank you very much and good luck for the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is [Alex] (ph) on for Gabe. Thanks for taking my question. So just thinking about the inventory level, can you maybe just kind of comment on what your targeted inventory looks like for year-end or when thinking about the Jackson outage.\nMark Kowlzan: We never give absolute numbers, but I can tell you, when we started out the third quarter, we -- the targets we had in mind, we far under -- we were dramatically lower than what our goals were for the ending inventory, and that's a positive situation to be in especially when we have the opportunity to get Wallula started back up and satisfy that demand. But we have a number in mind and what will influence that number, of course, is the shutdown schedule we have in plans for the Jackson conversion and then the other annual shutdowns that will take place in the first six months of the year in the rest of the containerboard system. And so the -- without giving you an absolute number, we have some work to do to get our inventory up where it needs to be get us into the new year and then get us through the first six months of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And just thinking about Wallula. Is there anything -- does anything change with the cost structure that we see, [Indiscernible] of as the mill restarts in variable or fixed?\nMark Kowlzan: Again, Wallula, it's no surprise, is our higher cost mill because of the fiber basket and the energy situation in the Pacific Northwest. But it remains a critical mill to us because of the local with our Pacific Northwest box plants. And so in that regard, the cost position won't change. We're taking advantage of running the big machine. We don't currently need the number two machine running, but that could change. So again, we will run to demand. we will satisfy what we need. Tom, do you want to add?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. I would just add that with Wallula mill operating in a very large market for us, it certainly gives us a lot more flexibility in a box plant to react and respond quicker to the marketplace as that continues to rebound. And of course, that's heavy ag up there as well. So this will be -- this will give us some advantage in terms of flexibility in that marketplace.\nBob Mundy: Yes. Alex, I'll just add that when we bring Wallula back on in the fourth quarter, again, we're doing our comparisons to the third. As Mark said, it is our highest cost mill. And we are -- as we get things ready so that we can restart the machine the first of November, we have been incurring labor costs and other things, obviously, with no production. So -- but there are no significant cash cost to restart. There may be some non-cash, some raw material write-off type obsolescence type things, but nothing significant there. But it does, if you're comparing to the third quarter, it accounts for -- as far as our cost increase, if you look at our operating costs, it's almost half of the increase is just coming from restarting Wallula and bringing those costs back online.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Okay. That's good. And I guess, my last question is just thinking about 2024, maybe can you just kind of maybe frame how you're thinking about \u201924, I understand we still have another quarter to-date, but just for the high levels of percentages, how you are thinking about '24? Thanks.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, just on a macro level, we're going to continue to do what we do run to demand. But the other thing is if I were an investor, which I am, but I would be looking at this on how we use our cash and where we're deploying cash. And we talked about this a little bit at the July call for next year, and we would anticipate the capital spending discipline to continue in the trend that it's been, we'll be in that $400 million level this year and plans call for next year to continue that pace of capital deployment, which if you then think about the excess cash being generated, where that goes. There are other opportunities to take advantage of that and bring value to the shareholders. And so we'll, again, continue to take advantage of the benefits of all the capital spending that we've been bringing to bear, get Jackson completed and then continue to look at more opportunities and execute and work with our customer base and taking care of our customers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Okay, I\u2019ll turn it over. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Alright. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning.\nTom Hassfurther: Good morning.\nAnthony Pettinari: We've seen a large amount of new recycled capacity being added to the market this year. I guess some integrated, some nonintegrated. And I just had two questions. I guess, first, could you talk about the impact on the market that you've seen or maybe haven't seen? And then second, maybe for more a big picture perspective, how should we think about PCA's mix? Historically, you've been a virgin board producer. Are there some opportunities to add recycled capacity? I guess, what we look and process OCC? Or do you still see Virgin playing this kind of unique role in the U.S. market? How do you think about that maybe over the next decade?\nMark Kowlzan: We've always been primarily a virgin linerboard medium producer, we have the capability of flexing a number of our mills. I think most people understand that we've invested heavily over the last decade. And in these conversion opportunities, DeRidder, Wallula, now the Jackson mill, Counce, the Northern Mills all have recycled capacity. But again, we're not going to put all our eggs in one basket and go all into recycle. We take advantage of it. And it does give us some opportunity to flex the fiber cost and time of year and availability. But again, I think -- if you look at us 10-years from now, we'll still look the same that we do today in terms of our fiber balance. Tom?\nTom Hassfurther: Anthony, the impact in the marketplace of the -- let's say, the one-offs, even having some integration in some of these mills is bearing out exactly like I had told you it would, with the very limited open market, we have seen virtually no impact at all from these mills. They're going to have to find a home somewhere else. Now the ones that are integrated and we'll be running to demand, I'm sure, and they're not even attempting to sell into the open market. Those that are the one-offs might attempt to sell into the open market. But again, it's -- we're finding that our domestic customers want to stick with PCA for the fact that we've got a great quality linerboard and medium. And we take care of our customers. Our service is very good. And they've shown absolutely zero interest in moving to any other supplier. And I think that's probably true across the board. So that -- hopefully, that answers that. And just to tag on with what Mark was saying, we value our fiber flexibility, and I can tell you that our mills if you go back -- you can go back in history and find PCA was a heavyweight mill system, and we've completely adapted to whatever the market is today. And we've got this ability to basically tailor our liners to whatever the needs of our customers are, and that's a huge competitive advantage we have.\nMark Kowlzan: One of the factors, if you think about recycled versus virgin fiber, virgin fiber prices and input costs, conversion costs have been very stable over the decades, relatively speaking, if you're solely dependent on OCC, DLK, the price and cost input swings have been wild high, low, high, low. And so trying to anticipate what your conversion cost is not a good place to be if you're 100% recycled. So we like where we are. We will continue with this model.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Dunigan: Good morning. Mark, Bob, Tom. This is John diving on for Phil. I wanted to start off with the implied 4Q guide box shipments. I mean, I know you said so far, bookings are up 14%, but bookings aren't actually billed. So if I'm just reading your press release being up on a per day basis in 4Q quarter-over-quarter on the shipping day. It seems to imply that 4Q, at least for the guide is up about 14.5% or so, 15%. Is that the right way to think about it? Any kind of extra color you could give on that?\nTom Hassfurther: No, that's not the right way to think about it, Phil. But I'm going to turn it over to Bob and see if he can walk you through this just a little bit, maybe if you calibrated.\nBob Mundy: Well, I'm not sure I can, Tom. No, Phil. That\u2019s -- I\u2019m not sure maybe we'd talk afterwards, but it's not sure how you're arriving at that certainly from anything that we said we put out. But that obviously would be a tremendous thing if that were to happen, but I just don't see how you're getting there. Maybe if you could just talk off-line.\nJohn Dunigan: Sounds good. And then just in terms of expectations going to the fourth quarter, obviously, it sounds like things are -- even if not mid-teens, they're still going pretty good and get more visibility. It seems a little bit in contrast to what [Indiscernible] said with just generally expectations for softer holiday demand. And I know it's customer-by-customer, and they're obviously not serving the whole market. But are you seeing the holiday demand here in the fourth quarter actually coming through pretty good?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes. I would say the holiday demand is going to be strong, yes.\nJohn Dunigan: Great. And just one last quick clarification. The 174,000 tons of economic downtime that you called out, was that just for Wallula or the whole company is incorporated to that for the economic downtime?\nMark Kowlzan: That was the Wallula downtime.\nJohn Dunigan: Okay. All right. Appreciate it. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Thank you, next question. Jamie, anybody left on the queue? I guess we will conclude. I think we've lost our moderator on the call, but for those of you that joined us today, I want to thank you for taking the time, and I look forward to having you join us at the end of January for our full-year and fourth quarter call. With that, have a good day. Take care.",

            "name": "Tom Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 1.9% and total shipments with two less shipping days were down 1.3%, compared to last year's third quarter. Versus the second quarter of 2023, shipments per day were up 3.9% and total shipments were up 2.3% even though there was one less shipping day. Outside sales volume of container board was 33,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 5,000 tons above the second quarter of 2023. Demand headwinds from a shift of consumer buying preferences towards more service-oriented spending, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and non-durable goods. However, we mentioned last quarter that many customers were telling us the inventory de-stocking of boxes and their products was behind them and we were hopeful that, that would translate to improving volume throughout the second-half of the year. We saw that occurring during the third quarter and we expect that momentum to continue into the fourth quarter although there is one less shipping day, compared to the third quarter. Relative to the published reductions in the industry benchmark grades that occurred late last year and earlier this year, domestic container board and corrugated products prices and mixed together were $1.12 per share below the third quarter of 2022, and down $0.45 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Export container board prices and mix were down $0.21 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2022 and down $0.03 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2023. And now I'll turn it back to Mark. Yes, I think George, this is really, you know, an effort to really realize the deployment of the capital that we've done in the -- in all the box plants and to streamline those box plants and to really get those box plants, you know, right-sized for the growth we've got coming and what the existing volume is right now. So we're very pleased. We're very, very pleased with the results. Yes, let me first just kind of tag along with what Mark just said relative to running to demand. You know, that is what we do. And if we didn't have the demand, we wouldn't be talking about restarting Wallula, pure and simple. Now to calibrate that a little bit, George, I think you need to really look at our low point was the first quarter of 2023 in terms of demand. Our demand currently is, you know, just in a couple of quarters is now 8% higher than that number and going higher going forward. So, you know, that's the real reason why we need the, you know, the cut up in -- at Wallula. It's really being driven on the box side of the business more so than anything else. And relative to the bookings and the billings, again, our bookings are up 14% for this at the beginning. And again that's, you know, you've got to take that number, because we've had high numbers and then we come in a little low, you know, we come in significantly lower for the actual quarter, because a lot of these bookings are for quite a ways out. But I think the key here is that the backlog remains incredibly strong, and our cut-up demand is also very strong. So we feel very good about where we are on the fourth quarter and certainly entering into next year. Yes, Mark. I mean, our trend still remains positive. So we'll be up. And again, I think it's really important to get calibrated kind of the correct way to some extent. And because when we look at the fourth quarter, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201822, in \u201822 we had an extra day in there given the way the FBA holidays fell. So we were actually up a couple of percent in the fourth quarter of \u201822 over the third quarter of \u201822. And -- but then, of course, in the first quarter of \u201823 is when we really hit what I call rock bottom in terms of demand. And as I said, so we're up just in a couple of quarters, 8%, and we look at that number going up again in the fourth quarter. No. Mix is a big factor in there, both in end uses and in basis weights. So it's there's a heck of a lot that goes into what the final pricing is. And as I mentioned last time, and I'll just mention it again, building products, that's still -- that segment, which is a good segment for us, still remains underwater as housing starts have been affected by higher interest rates. The graphics mix and the effect of what's going on and the changes that are taking place in brick-and-mortar stores, that's been impacted. And of course, our automotive segment with the UAW strike is now really starting to get impacted. Now all of those segments tend to be on the higher price side. However, we've got a lot of other segments that are doing quite well. And we're -- and we've been -- and we haven't been impacted much at all other than what you've seen in the publications in terms of price. End markets. And then when things started picking up. Yes, yes. Okay, well. Mike, I kind of -- I think, I got most of what you're asking here, but outside of those markets that I mentioned, one other market that I had mentioned prior was the ag business and told you that we had a lot of headwinds in ag, especially weather-related, those have pretty much dissipated, and we're looking for a very good ag season coming up, so that's going to be a lift. Of course, e-com has continues to kind of take a little bit of a larger share of the corrugated business, and that looks very good. And in general, I mean, we're selling a lot of food and beverage and all sorts of other segments. And those segments either remain very steady or have look good going forward. And I think the best news is it's becoming more predictable now given the fact that we've gotten all of this inventory and destocking out of the way, and our customers are operating quite lean at the moment. And so it's a lot easier to predict what's happening in a number of these segments. I hope that answers your question. Well, I think in addition, I think that as I mentioned, these segments that are down, those segments are going to come back. So they're going to show back up. And we'll continue to -- what we think is operate, you know, demonstrate the best value in the marketplace to an entire customer base and be able to grow our business accordingly as well. So we'll -- we're constantly looking outward to see what's possible and what those demands look like and working very closely with our customers, and we want to make sure we're well aligned. That's what's driving the whole Wallula project at the moment. Yes. I would just add that with Wallula mill operating in a very large market for us, it certainly gives us a lot more flexibility in a box plant to react and respond quicker to the marketplace as that continues to rebound. And of course, that's heavy ag up there as well. So this will be -- this will give us some advantage in terms of flexibility in that marketplace. Good morning. Anthony, the impact in the marketplace of the -- let's say, the one-offs, even having some integration in some of these mills is bearing out exactly like I had told you it would, with the very limited open market, we have seen virtually no impact at all from these mills. They're going to have to find a home somewhere else. Now the ones that are integrated and we'll be running to demand, I'm sure, and they're not even attempting to sell into the open market.

And we've got this ability to basically tailor our liners to whatever the needs of our customers are, and that's a huge competitive advantage we have. No, that's not the right way to think about it, Phil. But I'm going to turn it over to Bob and see if he can walk you through this just a little bit, maybe if you calibrated. Yes. I would say the holiday demand is going to be strong, yes."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO, PCA, and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business, and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details and then I'll wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday we reported third quarter net income of $183 million or $2.03 per share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2023 net income was $185 million or $2.05 per share, compared to the third quarter of 2022's net income of $266 million or $2.83 per share. Third quarter net sales were $1.9 billion in 2023 and $2.1 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding special items was $388 million in 2023 and $477 million in 2022. Third quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.02 per share, primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to container board conversion related activities. Details of all special items for the third quarter of 2023, as well as 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.78 per share decrease in third quarter 2023 earnings, compared to the third quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower price and mix of $1.33 and volume $0.09 in the packaging segments. Higher depreciation expense $0.11; lower volume in the paper segment $0.04; higher tax $0.02; and other expenses $0.02 cents. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.58, primarily resulting from lower recycled fiber and energy prices along with outstanding mill and plant operational execution. Other favorable items included a lower share count resulting from share repurchases in the second half of 2022 were $0.11, higher prices and mix in the paper segment $0.04, lower converting costs $0.04, lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.04, and lower freight and logistics expenses $0.02. The results were $0.17 above our third quarter guidance of $1.88 per share primarily due to higher volume in the packaging and paper segments and lower operating and converting costs. Looking at our packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter of 2023 of $374 million, with sales of $1.8 billion, resulted in a margin of 21.3% versus last year's EBITDA of $467 million, with sales of $1.9 billion, and a 24.1% margin. The operational benefits of our capital spending program and the continued great focus and execution of our mills and corrugated products facilities on numerous process improvement initiatives once again delivered impressive results. This included areas such as machine and equipment efficiencies, fiber, chemical and material usages, internal energy generation and usage, and labor costs. Our approach to cost-effective management of container board supply with demand also delivered the benefits we were anticipating. This was primarily achieved by idling the Wallula mill for the entire quarter, which resulted in a market-related downtime of approximately 174,000 tons. However, with the stronger demand in our packaging segment, we ended the quarter with inventory levels lower than anticipated. Based on our current outlook for improved demand, together with current plans for the first quarter of 2024 for the scheduled mill maintenance outages and completing the final phase of the container board conversion on the number three machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill. We are planning to restart the number three machine at the Wallula, Washington mill during the fourth quarter in order to bring our inventories to desired levels. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on container board sales in the corrugated business. Thank you, Tom. Looking at our paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $35 million with sales of $158 million or a 22.4% margin, compared to the third quarter of 2022's EBITDA of $33 million and sales of $165 million or a 19.7% margin. Seasonally stronger cut size and printing and converting volumes were 13% higher than the second quarter levels and down almost 8% versus the third quarter \u201822 with about 40% of the decline being driven by no paper sales from our Jackson mill in this year's third quarter. Prices and mix were up about 3.5% from last year's third quarter and down 2% from the second quarter of 2023, due to the declines in the index prices that occurred earlier in the year. Our International Falls mill managed their nine-day planned maintenance outage very well, and similar to the packaging facilities, the mill remained focused on efficient and cost-effective operations, delivering great results for the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead as we move forward into the -- from the third into the fourth quarter, in our packaging segment we expect less market-related downtime as we build our inventories back to appropriate levels, along with higher shipments per day in our corrugated products facilities, although our plans will have one less shipping day, compared to the third quarter. We also expect lower average prices primarily due to the majority of the May decrease in the published benchmark index grades being realized throughout the third quarter, as well as a seasonally less rich mix. In our paper segment, volume will be lower compared to the seasonally stronger third quarter and prices and mix are assumed to trend lower with declines in the index prices. Operating and converting costs will increase -- driven by higher recycled fiber prices, seasonal energy costs, and the restart of the wool of the mill. Depreciation expense is estimated to be slightly higher and scheduled maintenance outage expenses will be lower. Considering all of these items, we expect the fourth quarter earnings of $1.76 per share. With that, I would be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. These statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K and the subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to go ahead and open up the call for questions, please. Good morning, George. You know, it's the benefit of the year-after-year continuous improvement that we've had in place. And as we've said over the years, we're constantly doing hundreds and hundreds of projects a year. Some are small, some are large, but nevertheless it's an ongoing, continuous process across the board. And if you think about the box plants and the mills, there's a daily activity with the technology organization in concert with the local operational management focused clearly on cost takeout and just operational excellence. And this has been going on for a number of years and will continue to go on. Tom, I think, you know, you've got great examples in the box plants that we just continue to execute. You know, George, as far as next year, you know, as you could expect, we're already and have been talking about, you know, what's on the horizon for next year, what are the opportunities. And so we've got a very good, solid plan in place on where we're going after these cost takeouts and continued operational improvements, along with just being able to look at what the market requirements are going to be in terms of customer needs and addressing that. And while we address that, we're always looking at how we're deploying that capital and how that impacts the operation in terms of labor cost and energy and input conversion cost. So we've got a good plan for next year also. Thanks, George. Yes, you know, as far as Wallula, as we've always said, we're going to run to demand. And Wallula is just one of the opportunities we have to move the needle on our needs. And so by getting number three started up, you know, over the course of the next couple of weeks, it will fulfill our current needs. And we'll anticipate that through next year. If demand just holds on the trajectory that it is right now, we'll need Wallula running through the year and so we will look at the opportunity to supply the marketplace. We've got our own internal targets on what we want our inventories to be to minimize transportation and logistics issues. But we can flex the system up and down and as we always have, we will always run to demand. So that's how I'll answer that. And then Tom, why don't you go into the current box cut-up? Next question please. Yes, no, you know, the work will be done next year, late first quarter into the second quarter. It's a longer outage, but it will be the final phase of the completion work necessary to take care of the big machine. But you're talking about \u201823 additional high-pressure dryer cans, modifying the press section, we're removing the fourth press, installing the new shoe press, a number of modifications in that regard to enhance the speed, the drying capability. But it's that final phase that gets the productivity up, but also some of the work in the back end of the mill is related to the cost position of the mill. So when this work is done, depending on the demand coming out of that mill, that mill will be, as far as cost competitive position, it will be right in there with the DeRidder and Counce in Valdosta. You know, I'm not going to answer that right now, because I don't want to say the wrong thing. I'm going to let Bob, if he recalls, but at the end of the day, the machine, you know, if you think about where we've been running the machine on a daily basis, you know, the machine's been flexing anywhere from 1,200 tons a day to 1,800 tons a day, depending on what we needed. But when we're done with this project, the capability of that machine will be well over 2,000 tons a day. The target is 2,400 tons a day when we're done with this. So if you use a 352 day a year, you'll get your annual tons. Just for simple math, you can, whether you use 2,000 or 2,200, but the ultimate goal between myself and some of the people around me is that machine will be a 2,400 ton a day machine someday when we're done fine tuning it. But it would be -- to my knowledge, it would be the most productive, low-cost, linerboard machine in the Western Hemisphere. Thank you. Next question? Thank you. Thanks, Mike. Well, no, again, currently, because of the inventory situation, we'll have to run the entire mill system to capacity. And so the six mills that ran during the third quarter, we'll have to continue running full out, and then Wallula number three, we'll have to come up and perform equally as efficiently. Well, if you look at over the decades, we've always grown with our customers. And we still have the most diverse, broad book of business nationwide with local accounts and we'll continue to grow with those accounts and help enhance their business. And so that's where a lot of the opportunity always comes from. Tom, do you want to elaborate on that? Thank you. Next question, please. We never give absolute numbers, but I can tell you, when we started out the third quarter, we -- the targets we had in mind, we far under -- we were dramatically lower than what our goals were for the ending inventory, and that's a positive situation to be in especially when we have the opportunity to get Wallula started back up and satisfy that demand. But we have a number in mind and what will influence that number, of course, is the shutdown schedule we have in plans for the Jackson conversion and then the other annual shutdowns that will take place in the first six months of the year in the rest of the containerboard system. And so the -- without giving you an absolute number, we have some work to do to get our inventory up where it needs to be get us into the new year and then get us through the first six months of the year. Again, Wallula, it's no surprise, is our higher cost mill because of the fiber basket and the energy situation in the Pacific Northwest. But it remains a critical mill to us because of the local with our Pacific Northwest box plants. And so in that regard, the cost position won't change. We're taking advantage of running the big machine. We don't currently need the number two machine running, but that could change. So again, we will run to demand. we will satisfy what we need. Tom, do you want to add? Well, just on a macro level, we're going to continue to do what we do run to demand. But the other thing is if I were an investor, which I am, but I would be looking at this on how we use our cash and where we're deploying cash. And we talked about this a little bit at the July call for next year, and we would anticipate the capital spending discipline to continue in the trend that it's been, we'll be in that $400 million level this year and plans call for next year to continue that pace of capital deployment, which if you then think about the excess cash being generated, where that goes. There are other opportunities to take advantage of that and bring value to the shareholders. And so we'll, again, continue to take advantage of the benefits of all the capital spending that we've been bringing to bear, get Jackson completed and then continue to look at more opportunities and execute and work with our customer base and taking care of our customers. Alright. Next question? We've always been primarily a virgin linerboard medium producer, we have the capability of flexing a number of our mills. I think most people understand that we've invested heavily over the last decade. And in these conversion opportunities, DeRidder, Wallula, now the Jackson mill, Counce, the Northern Mills all have recycled capacity. But again, we're not going to put all our eggs in one basket and go all into recycle. We take advantage of it. And it does give us some opportunity to flex the fiber cost and time of year and availability. But again, I think -- if you look at us 10-years from now, we'll still look the same that we do today in terms of our fiber balance. Tom? One of the factors, if you think about recycled versus virgin fiber, virgin fiber prices and input costs, conversion costs have been very stable over the decades, relatively speaking, if you're solely dependent on OCC, DLK, the price and cost input swings have been wild high, low, high, low. And so trying to anticipate what your conversion cost is not a good place to be if you're 100% recycled. So we like where we are. We will continue with this model. Next question. That was the Wallula downtime. Okay. Thank you, next question. Jamie, anybody left on the queue? I guess we will conclude. I think we've lost our moderator on the call, but for those of you that joined us today, I want to thank you for taking the time, and I look forward to having you join us at the end of January for our full-year and fourth quarter call. With that, have a good day. Take care."

The more significant cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $90 million, common stock dividends totaled $112 million, $63 million for federal and state income tax payments, and $51 million for pension and other post-employment benefit contributions. In addition, we repurchased just over 286,000 shares of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $144.81 per share for a total of about $42 million. We ended the quarter with $726 million of cash, including marketable securities and our liquidity on September 30th was approximately $1.1 billion. Lastly, our planned annual maintenance outage expense for the third quarter was just over $0.22 per share and the fourth quarter is now expected to be about $0.19, bringing the 2023 full year total to $0.72 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yes, Mark, and the improvement from where we are today versus where we will be when we hit that run rate after the completion of the second phase, it's close to $40 a ton. That benefit coming from most of your direct variable type costs and you're getting all this additional volume with no increases in your, obviously indirect costs or any fixed costs. So you get a nice, huge benefit once this project is completed. Yes. Alex, I'll just add that when we bring Wallula back on in the fourth quarter, again, we're doing our comparisons to the third. As Mark said, it is our highest cost mill. And we are -- as we get things ready so that we can restart the machine the first of November, we have been incurring labor costs and other things, obviously, with no production. So -- but there are no significant cash cost to restart. There may be some non-cash, some raw material write-off type obsolescence type things, but nothing significant there. But it does, if you're comparing to the third quarter, it accounts for -- as far as our cost increase, if you look at our operating costs, it's almost half of the increase is just coming from restarting Wallula and bringing those costs back online. Well, I'm not sure I can, Tom. No, Phil. That's -- I'm not sure maybe we'd talk afterwards, but it's not sure how you're arriving at that certainly from anything that we said we put out. But that obviously would be a tremendous thing if that were to happen, but I just don't see how you're getting there. Maybe if you could just talk off-line."

Your host for today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kowlzan. Sir, please proceed when you're ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging Business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $203 million, or $2.24 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2023 net income was $209 million, or $2.31 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2022 net income of $304 million, or $3.23 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $418 million in 2023 and $533 million in 2022. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.07 per share for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities and closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and design centers. Details of special items for both the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.92 per share decrease in second quarter 2023 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower volumes in the Packaging segment for $0.90 and Paper segment $0.07. Lower price and mix in the Packaging segment of $0.47 and higher depreciation expense, $0.09, and higher other converting costs, $0.03. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.34, primarily driven by lower fiber, energy and chemical costs. We also had higher prices and mix in the Paper segment for $0.12, a lower share count resulting from the share repurchase in the second half of 2022 for $0.13; lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses for $0.03 and a lower tax rate for $0.02. The results were $0.35 above the second quarter guidance of $1.96 per share, primarily due to lower operating costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives and lower freight and logistics expenses. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter of 2023 of $405 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 23% versus last year's EBITDA of $525 million and sales of $2.1 billion or a 25% EBITDA margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was about where we expected for the quarter, and Tom will discuss this further in a moment. As they did in the first quarter, our employees remain focused on very efficient and cost-effective operations as we balanced our supply according to the demand, or said another way we are extremely effective at managing what is in our control. In our mills, this included things like improving our wood yields, producing board closer to nominal basis weights, reducing fiber and chemical usage and running our pulp mills more efficiently, increasing our internal energy generation while also reducing our energy consumption and executing our planned maintenance outages for less cost than we had estimated. Also at our mills and including our corrugated facilities, we closely monitored headcount and overtime as well as usage of materials and supplies in addition to other discretionary spending items. In addition, our mills and plants, together with our logistics and distribution personnel worked effectively to minimize the negative impacts from rail rate increases at certain locations and changes in the mix of shipping locations as we ran our system to demand. Finally, as you know, we temporarily curtailed operations at our Wallula, Washington mill once we exited the planned maintenance outage early in the quarter. This was not a reaction to any change in our views on demand, but rather our thoughtful approach to manage containerboard supply as economically as possible. The mill remains temporarily curtailed and we will continue to monitor any potential changes to this strategy along with our outlook for demand during the second half of the year. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. Total prices and mix in the Packaging segment came in where we anticipated with domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together $0.32 per share below the second quarter of 2022 and also $0.32 per share below the first quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were down $0.15 per share versus last year's second quarter and down $0.07 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. As Mark indicated, Packaging segment volume for the quarter also came in where we expected. Corrugated product shipments were down 9.8% in total and per workday compared to last year's second quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 62,000 tons below last year's second quarter and 33,000 tons above the first quarter of 2023. With last year's box volume tying our shipments per workday second quarter record we knew this will be a tough comparison period. As we said on last quarter's call, the same variables that have impacted demand, the last few quarters would continue into the second quarter. The shift of consumer buying preferences more towards service-oriented spending, persistent inflation and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and nondurable goods. Inventory destocking, both in boxes and at our customers' products also continued to varying degrees across our customer bases and the manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for eight months in a row now. However, as we talked about last quarter, we expected some improvement relative to the inventory destocking of both customer product and boxes as well as improvements based on certain customers' feedback regarding their business and that is what helped the second quarter shipments improved almost 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect continued positive momentum this quarter, although there is one less work day compared to the second quarter. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $39 million with sales of $143 million for a 27% margin compared to the second quarter of 2022 EBITDA of $32 million and sales of $150 million, or 21% margin. Paper prices and mix were 12% higher than last year's second quarter and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2023. Paper demand remains soft with our sales volume just over 14% below last year's second quarter, which also included some sales from our Jackson, Alabama mill, where there was no volume in this year's second quarter. We ran our International Falls mill to match supply with demand as well as to build some additional inventory during the quarter to prepare for the nine-day planned outage \u2013 maintenance outage that's coming up this third quarter. Similar to the comments I made regarding the Packaging business and for many of the same categories, employees in our Paper business remained focused on efficient and cost-effective operations as they also balance supply according to demand and delivered outstanding margins for the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks Mark. For the quarter, we generated new second quarter records for cash from operations of $360 million as well as free cash flow of $233 million. Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $126 million, common stock dividends of $112 million, cash taxes of $83 million, and net interest payments of $30 million. We ended the quarter with $630 million of marketable securities and cash on hand with liquidity of almost $1 billion. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second and into the third quarter, in our Packaging segment, although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect shipments per day to improve versus the second quarter. However, prices will be lower as a result of previously published domestic containerboard price decreases along with slightly lower export prices. We expect seasonally stronger volumes in our Paper segment from back-to-school shipments, although prices are expected to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices. Operating converting costs should trend slightly higher, primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices and seasonal energy cost. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher by approximately $0.06 per share, driven by the scheduled maintenance outage at International Falls, Minnesota. Finally, we estimate that our depreciation expense and tax rate to be slightly higher as well. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $1.88 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. Statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company. And involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K and on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call up for questions, please.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the operating performance in the quarter. Mark, Bob, Tom, my first question, the excellent from our vantage point operating performance in 2Q, I guess, the $0.34 or so and lower operating costs. How much of that is embedded in your third quarter guidance? Is there any chance within reasonable probabilities that you could \u2013 given all the efforts that your employees have underway, find further efficiencies and benefits such that there might be some upside tilt to your guidance. So have us think about how operations might be able to benefit? And what's baked into your third quarter guidance?\nMark Kowlzan: George, as we always do, we continue to focus on 365 days a year, continuous improvement, operational excellence. One thing we commented on last year as we were moving into 2023 and we are winding down a lot of the major capital projects, we're going to take the approximately 150 engineers and technology personnel in our corporate technology group and really let them focus now on unit operations optimization and really work with the box plants and mills on a lot of the new equipment, quite frankly, that have been installed in the last couple of years, but really take that to a new level of performance and execution. And that's paid off for us this year, as you can see. So my answer is we will continue in that effort. Nothing is guaranteed, but we do obviously perform quite well in general. And I would expect to see similar results going forward. Tom, Bob from your perspective.\nBob Mundy: Yes, Mark, it's \u2013 this is Bob. George, I'll say that from the operating cost perspective, we'll hold on to really the performance we had in the second quarter. If you just assume that that production volume in the mills is similar to the second, maybe up a little bit, we'll see. Yet, we think our cost per ton stays relatively flat. So to be able to hold on to that even though we know OCC prices will be higher, if you just take the average, they moved up from the end of the second quarter and just supply that across the third quarter, they're up like 12% or 14%. So we'll overcome that plus we have the seasonal electricity rates that hits you as well as some seasonal usage items. So in effect, we'll pretty much be offsetting that by continuing the excellent operating cost performance in the mills and the box plants.\nMark Kowlzan: Tom?\nTom Hassfurther: George this is Tom, I would just add one last thing. It's very obvious that a lot of this \u2013 a lot of this extensive groundwork has taken place and as our volume increase is going forward we're going to be able to take advantage of this cost position we're in. And it will be quite dramatic, I think, going forward as the business conditions change and get more positive.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. Very, very helpful.\nMark Kowlzan: George let me just\u2026\nGeorge Staphos: Please go ahead Mark. \nMark Kowlzan: George let me add one thing. If you looked at our quarter and you looked at month by month, we were running in not just one mill, but most of the mill system, we were pushing 99% uptime efficiency, operational efficiency in our mills. I mean, that's unheard of in the industry. Month of June, we had most of the mills in that category, and we had we had one mill in particular that was like basically 99.99% uptime efficient. It had no paper breaks. And so, we're in a level now, it's obviously not many of our competitors are there, but that's what we strive to do every day and make it better and better. And so I'm confident we'll continue to see good results.\nGeorge Staphos: It's a great rundown and obviously something we'll all try to continue to remember going forward. Two last ones for me, and I'll turn it over to some degree, kind of the obligatory, when we think about the 2Q index pricing changes, roughly, roughly, how much of that is baked into your third quarter guidance percentage wise and what would be left in fourth quarter? And then, Tom or Bob or Mark, back to the closures that you mentioned in corrugated and the design centers, I mean, it's kind of self-explanatory, but what was, if there was a common denominator, what were you looking to achieve with whatever reconfiguration you were doing? Thank you guys.\nTom Hassfurther: George, I will take the closure piece and then I'll turn it over to Bob and he can comment on the pricing changes going forward. But on the closure side, listen we have continuously tried to make sure that we're right sized for the business and that we have very efficient operating methods. And part of our whole capital investment has been around making sure that we're as efficient as we possibly can in the plants that make the most sense. So, that's been an ongoing process. This is nothing really new, we're just announcing it because it took place in the quarter. But this is small facilities and its consolidation and some things like that. So, it's kind of more the normal course of business for us. Bob?\nBob Mundy: Yes, George, regarding the price, I guess a way to think about it is in the first quarter there were two drops in prices that occurred during the quarter on the benchmark grade for $30 a ton. And then the second \u2013 and \u2013 the impact of that is, as we say, it pretty much runs through over a 90-day period. So, the bulk of that was reflected in our second quarter numbers. So, if you think about what occurred in the second quarter where there was a $20 drop and you sort of ratio that with what happened in the first with the $30 drop, you can sort of get the impact of price in the third quarter. Does that make sense?\nGeorge Staphos: Yes, I guess so. I mean, I guess what I would ask is just how much again, not trying to be too precise, I know you can't be, how much of a residual would be left of that in for the fourth quarter, 5%, 30%?\nBob Mundy: For the fourth quarter most of it will be from the latest drop will be in the third.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay.\nBob Mundy: And the impact will be, like I said, if you sort of compare that to what happened in the first, we gave you the impact of\u2026\nGeorge Staphos: Yes.\nBob Mundy: I mean, yes, in the second quarter. And then, so in the \u2013 you would think \u2013 if no other changes, the fourth should be \u2013 you shouldn't see much of an impact if things sort of hang out where they are right now.\nGeorge Staphos: That's perfect. Thank you, Bob. I'll turn it over.\nBob Mundy: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, second quarter record cash flow from operations pretty interesting in this challenging environment. And one of the things obviously is your CapEx has been coming down after all those big projects. Can you sort of just update us on where your thoughts for CapEx for this year and preliminarily if the environment remains challenging what type of CapEx you might bracket for next year?\nBob Mundy: Yes, Mark over a year ago actually we started getting people thinking about the fact that the heavy projects were winding up, the big projects that we had been involved in over the last ten years were really coming to fruition. And that 2023 would be a year that we wound that capital down in the $400 million range, last year we were $824 million of capital spending. And we would \u2013 again we alerted everybody that this year would be in that $400 million level, and that's where we are. I fully expect us to finish the year somewhere in that $400 million area. And then we're already talking about the 2024 capital spending plan. And looking at our needs and the opportunities, we feel comfortable right now that the number will continue to be in that $400 million area unless some opportunity came along that was so outstanding that we felt compelled that we wanted to direct our capital into that opportunity. So, we have that luxury right now. But I think for the benefit of running the business on certain times we're in $400 million range is a good range to be in, and it supports business improvement opportunities along with maintenance capital spending within the mills and box plants.\nMark Weintraub: Great. And even at the $400 million do you still have runway? I think you are referencing to still get some of these operating improvements that we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters or does that start running out pretty quickly if the CapEx doesn't go higher?\nMark Kowlzan : No, that's the beauty of it. We're continuing to execute every week on a number of opportunities within the box plants, new equipment installations, new equipment \u2013 significant rebuilds modifications on a lot of the production lines. So, this is not stopping. The mills, as we talked about, we wound up most of the big work at Wallula mill last year and the woodyard work in the OCC plant, Jackson, Alabama, most of that work has wound up, we're just waiting for the opportunity to move into the final phase of the number three machine at Jackson. But again, we can do all of that and still keep the capital spending in this $400 million range. That provides us an opportunity to really just move forward as we look at what these \u2013 whether it's a customer-driven opportunity, or a cost take out efficiency, energy efficiency, labor efficiency, we continue to see those opportunities. And where we are right now like I say, barring some big one-off opportunity, some $400 million number keeps us moving forward with taking advantage of this. Bob?\nBob Mundy: Just one other thing, Mark, is a lot of the operating cost improvement and things that you're seeing it's not necessarily capital related, it's just doing things within the process, watching usage, watching your routines, behaviors, practices, improving upon where you've been before and a lot of that is not capital driven, it's just there is a huge benefit of our operating costs is managed just by those things as well. Mark, over the last few years, we were doing hundreds of projects in our box plants and mills on an annual basis. Granted a lot of them are smaller projects, but literally we had our entire workforce moving to make improvements in hundreds and hundreds of areas every year. And now that we've been able to slow this process down, we're able to take advantage of that. And now the personnel can really take a much closer look and a deeper dive in how is that equipment running. And from a unit operations effectiveness and efficiency the operating personnel at the plants and the mills, the technology organization, are now really stepping back and looking at all of the new converting lines, the projects at the mills and really assessing are these projects doing what we expected them to do and if not, how do we make it do what we expect it to do? And if they are optimizing and fine tuning and the benefits are what we've seen in the second quarter is a great example. And we'll continue to do that,\nMark Weintraub: Appreciate that. And I say it's certainly showing. So, just one, if I could go back to the bridge from the second to third quarter, make sure that I understood. I mean, it sounded like there wasn't going to be any negative pickup in operating costs. And I guess you alluded to like a $0.06 increase in maintenance outages. And so if we look at the $2.31 and we go to a $1.88 that would seem to be like a $0.37 other if we take off the $0.06 for the maintenance. Is that primarily impact from price or are there other variables to be conscious of when doing that bridge? Because it seems kind of high on \u2013 for a price number.\nBob Mundy: Yes. I think you are pretty close, Mark if you looked at those two items on the \u2013 well just look at the price and the outages maybe a little bit different than what you were saying, but there is almost probably 90% of the delta right there. And then on the operating call side, if you take in some of the other things that to offset the higher recycle fiber prices and the energy costs that we spoke of, it's, hopefully will be pretty close to a push. And so what you're left with are just a couple of cents here and there. We talked about depreciation, we put that in our release, and that just has to do higher depreciation from the second quarter, just has to do with the timing of placing our assets in service based from our capital spending program. And we had some benefits in the second quarter that won't repeat in the third. On the tax side, there were just some favorable tax items from the vesting of stock and performance units, as well as some state tax law changes that gave us a benefit that don't repeat themselves. So, those are the other few items that get used to that 40 \u2013 $0.43 change.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nBob Mundy: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi this is Alex [ph] on for Gabe. Thanks for taking the question here. I was hoping you could give me some color on the bookings in July and maybe how this is trending compared to January and May? And just thinking about the Q3 volume pickup I was wondering if you can help parse out how much of that is seasonality and demand \u2013 underlying demand? Thanks.\nTom Hassfurther: Okay, Alex [ph] this is Tom. Our bookings for July we\u2019re about halfway through the month is very robust up 15%, which is great good start to the quarter. The other thing that we're seeing is, I think, that's pretty important and I want to point out is that a lot of our customers are telling us that some of this destocking is now over with their products. And that's very important. So, hopefully that will translate throughout the quarter and certainly going into the fourth quarter for some volume that is, what I would call, more predictable. We still do \u2013 I'll just go ahead and point this out right now we do have some challenging segments still that we're dealing with which indicates some of our decline in volume. The ag business, Florida had the worst citrus season they have had since the 30s or 40s. We had hurricanes down there, which completely wiped out some of the tomatoes and all the strawberries for a cycle. We've had flooding in Northern California, which has caused a lot of problems. They it's a \u2013 feast or famine there and I guess in terms of moisture, but \u2013 and then in Eastern Washington also they had some pretty serious droughts. So that, that segment has been \u2013 has been a drag on us. The building product segment was booming during COVID with a lot of remodeling going on and all those sorts of things. And that slowed down dramatically, and now because of high interest rates it's really slowed down housing starts. So that's been a \u2013 that's been a drag on us as well as single use plastic products manufacturers. So those are the \u2013 those are the segments that have \u2013 that have impacted us on a negative point. The ag will recover for sure. The e-com and the food and beverage, those \u2013 those segments have held up significantly better. But I think the \u2013 I think the key takeaway here going into the second half of the year is the fact that a lot of this destocking has now finally taken place and I think we'll have more predictability going forward relative to volume.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. Okay. And I guess as a follow up question; I'm just curious on your cost focus side, can you maybe talk about which side of the costs are still being pressured and maybe some cost buckets that are kind of coming down there?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, again you're always concerned about fiber costs and energy transportation especially on the rail, rail rates continue to move up. So it's \u2013 it's, and then as we go through the third into the fourth we'll be getting into the seasonal cooler months and, and energy usage along with \u2013 with cost pressure from that usage. So as wood cost is always a factor depending on weather conditions, so it's a continuing whole host of all your input and what's happening at any given time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Nice. Okay. Yes, I turn it over. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Dunigan: Good morning, Mark, Bob, Tom. This is John Dunigan on for Phil. I just, I wanted to start off around the box shipment, I mean, you guys have lagged the last few quarters from the overall market, which is generally surprising given your solid track record. Would you consider that more of a factor of the local customers and them feeling more of the pinch that you've kind of called out prior? Or is it you're maybe seeing a little bit more pressure from customers on pricing and, and you're walking away from some of that business?\nTom Hassfurther: John, this is Tom, I'll take this one. I would say that there are a couple of reasons why our numbers look like they do. Number one is we had unbelievably tough comps from a year ago. And if you go back, I mean, we were significantly higher than the industry even, even much than our normal trend. And I think that's because as I mentioned even back then, the wide segment of business and wide swath of different businesses whether they're local, national or what segments they're in all were up significantly during the COVID period. And as I just mentioned a while ago a number of those have come down significantly. And I'm talking \u2013 when I say significant, we haven't lost any \u2013 we haven't lost any of these customers, but we have some that are down 50-plus percent still at this rate just because there was so much demand during COVID and that demand has shrunk so significantly. So those are the \u2013 those to me are the main reasons why \u2013 why it looks as if we're lagging the industry probably more so than, and the numbers look so much different than they \u2013 than they have in the past.\nJohn Dunigan: Okay. That's helpful. And just with the pricing that we've seen already come out, so they already realized $90 per ton on the containerboard side. Are you seeing prices erode maybe a little bit quicker on the box side? Or are these seem generally in line with historical trend?\nTom Hassfurther: I'll be \u2013 I got to temper this a little bit in terms of discussing this. But what we're seeing is no, I would say no way is, is box \u2013 is the box trend worse than the linerboard medium trend. In fact, I would even say that our observations and what we've heard from our customers they've been quite surprised that of any linerboard medium reductions that have taken place. And I would say on the box side, it's very much the same thing.\nJohn Dunigan: Okay. That's very helpful. And if I could just squeeze one more in, did the box demand progression in the second quarter seem to get worse from what you had called out month-to-date on the last earnings call through the rest of the quarter? Could you kind of just give us a breakdown of maybe what you were seeing during the quarter and then if things had weakened was there any material economic downtime that you guys took to kind of help offset that?\nBob Mundy: Our volume was pretty much what we expected it to be with which was slightly improving in June, quite frankly was very strong. So we felt pretty good as, as the quarter moved \u2013 moved through the months, and again we saw that in June and we're continuing to see that in July. So I'm not sure...\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. I would just \u2013 I would just add that. I would just add that. We were up about 3% Q2-over-Q1 and the trend line continues to look quite favorable. So we'll \u2013 and the beauty of \u2013 the beauty of what we've done and what we talked about on the operating side is that we can flex now however we need to and to whatever the demands are and do it very cost effectively.\nBob Mundy: And I'll just add that the economic downtime was pretty much what we had anticipated it to be. So there was no \u2013 no change there from what we were assuming.\nJohn Dunigan: Does that mean essentially flat in terms of a ton percentage quarter-over-quarter?\nBob Mundy: On a per ton \u2013 on a per day basis it's up.\nJohn Dunigan: Yes.\nBob Mundy: It's up. So I think Tom made some comments about what he's seeing as far as trends now and so forth. So hopefully that that means from on a total basis, even though there's one less day that, that could be something that some tailwind there that hopefully we can \u2013 we can realize in our numbers.\nJohn Dunigan: Apologies. To clarify what I meant was the, the economic downtime on a tons basis. You were saying there wasn't any change from...\nBob Mundy: Well, again we'll \u2013 we'll have to see. That's \u2013 that's always a moving target, but I would say in total, because we do have less scheduled outages as far from a ton perspective. So we get tons back from that in the third versus the second. There's an additional day of in the mill so you get another day there, so there's another 15,000 tons or so. So, and we'll just manage the, the economic downtime commiserate with that pickup that we're seeing from the second quarter.\nJohn Dunigan: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: Tom, just following up on the July trends that you discussed, the 15% \u2013 up 15% is that month-over-month or year-over-year? And then you talked about destocking maybe kind of running its course or maybe being closer to the end. In terms of your own inventories, I mean, you talked about inventories down 11,000 tons from 1Q. Just wondering where your inventories are broadly kind of relative to target levels or comfort levels? Yes, those are my questions.\nTom Hassfurther: Okay, Anthony, relative to the July trends, let's, the one thing we've typically started out most quarters up quite a bit year-over-year. And that no different \u2013 no different this quarter but there's \u2013 there's a little more predictability in these numbers than what we've had in the past. And I'm seeing \u2013 I'm seeing our customer's trends of order patterns starting to come more in line with where they had been prior to all this destocking and this big change from after COVID. So that's \u2013 that's the best I can tell you about the July trends. I'm feeling better about these trends than, than in the past. And these numbers up and don't forget, I mean, when its bookings, you're talking about not just in the month of July, you're talking about August, September kind of out through the quarter. And so but \u2013 but again these \u2013 these patterns seem to be \u2013 seem to be much more predictable. Relative to the \u2013 relative to the inventories we didn't talk about export. Export's still a moving target and it's \u2013 it's certainly something that we're trying to get our arms around and it \u2013 and it seems to change almost on a daily basis in this \u2013 in this global demand. So I think we feel comfortable with where inventories are and, but again we've got the ability to flex some depending on \u2013 depending on what the demand curves are.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's helpful. And the 15%, it was year-over-year not month-over-month?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Yes.\nAnthony Pettinari: Great. And then I guess is there any way to frame kind of the financial impact of the Wallula curtailment and understanding this is in line with matching supply to demand. Any kind of just broader thoughts on that decision as we go through the year?\nMark Kowlzan: As we were running through the first quarter and into the second quarter, we were running the mills in many cases slowed back and just kind of throttling our way through demand. As we got into the springtime and we had our outages taking place, we were into the Wallula outage and we didn't see the improvement at that time back in April with demand. And so we quickly reassessed our position and realized that it was far better to take the six mills that we currently have running and run them very, very efficiently. And then in order to do that, you had to take Wallula and keep it down. So we were \u2013 we had Wallula down for the annual outage. So we finished that work and, and decided to just temporarily idle that mill for the time being as, as we watched the demand situation. But by doing that, it allowed us to take the six other containerboard mills and really optimize them and speed them up to the optimum point on their production curve and take advantage of that, and that's another part of the benefit we saw in the second quarter earnings.\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, Anthony...\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's...\nTom Hassfurther: And just for the \u2013 to frame it up a little, it's more \u2013 it's that you take out the highest cost mill in our system and, and then you run your lower cost mills more, more full out. Even though there is a freight penalty from Wallula, the lowest cost from a freight perspective because of where it ships to. And so you will, do have a freight penalty by operating that way, but it's probably close to $15 a ton of benefit operating that way versus if we had tried to manage it across the entire system rather than isolating Wallula.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that it's showing no additional questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Kowlzan for any closing remarks.\nMark Kowlzan: Again thank you for joining us today on the call, and look forward to talking to you when we wrap up our third quarter and have our call in October. Have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll be wrapping up today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Total prices and mix in the Packaging segment came in where we anticipated with domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together $0.32 per share below the second quarter of 2022 and also $0.32 per share below the first quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were down $0.15 per share versus last year's second quarter and down $0.07 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. As Mark indicated, Packaging segment volume for the quarter also came in where we expected. Corrugated product shipments were down 9.8% in total and per workday compared to last year's second quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 62,000 tons below last year's second quarter and 33,000 tons above the first quarter of 2023. With last year's box volume tying our shipments per workday second quarter record we knew this will be a tough comparison period. As we said on last quarter's call, the same variables that have impacted demand, the last few quarters would continue into the second quarter. The shift of consumer buying preferences more towards service-oriented spending, persistent inflation and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and nondurable goods. Inventory destocking, both in boxes and at our customers' products also continued to varying degrees across our customer bases and the manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for eight months in a row now. However, as we talked about last quarter, we expected some improvement relative to the inventory destocking of both customer product and boxes as well as improvements based on certain customers' feedback regarding their business and that is what helped the second quarter shipments improved almost 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect continued positive momentum this quarter, although there is one less work day compared to the second quarter. I'll now turn it back to Mark. George this is Tom, I would just add one last thing. It's very obvious that a lot of this \u2013 a lot of this extensive groundwork has taken place and as our volume increase is going forward we're going to be able to take advantage of this cost position we're in. And it will be quite dramatic, I think, going forward as the business conditions change and get more positive. George, I will take the closure piece and then I'll turn it over to Bob and he can comment on the pricing changes going forward. But on the closure side, listen we have continuously tried to make sure that we're right sized for the business and that we have very efficient operating methods. And part of our whole capital investment has been around making sure that we're as efficient as we possibly can in the plants that make the most sense. So, that's been an ongoing process. This is nothing really new, we're just announcing it because it took place in the quarter. But this is small facilities and its consolidation and some things like that. So, it's kind of more the normal course of business for us. Bob? Okay, Alex [ph] this is Tom. Our bookings for July we're about halfway through the month is very robust up 15%, which is great good start to the quarter. The other thing that we're seeing is, I think, that's pretty important and I want to point out is that a lot of our customers are telling us that some of this destocking is now over with their products. And that's very important. So, hopefully that will translate throughout the quarter and certainly going into the fourth quarter for some volume that is, what I would call, more predictable. We still do \u2013 I'll just go ahead and point this out right now we do have some challenging segments still that we're dealing with which indicates some of our decline in volume. The ag business, Florida had the worst citrus season they have had since the 30s or 40s. We had hurricanes down there, which completely wiped out some of the tomatoes and all the strawberries for a cycle. We've had flooding in Northern California, which has caused a lot of problems. They it's a \u2013 feast or famine there and I guess in terms of moisture, but \u2013 and then in Eastern Washington also they had some pretty serious droughts. So that, that segment has been \u2013 has been a drag on us. The building product segment was booming during COVID with a lot of remodeling going on and all those sorts of things. And that slowed down dramatically, and now because of high interest rates it's really slowed down housing starts. So that's been a \u2013 that's been a drag on us as well as single use plastic products manufacturers. So those are the \u2013 those are the segments that have \u2013 that have impacted us on a negative point. The ag will recover for sure. The e-com and the food and beverage, those \u2013 those segments have held up significantly better. But I think the \u2013 I think the key takeaway here going into the second half of the year is the fact that a lot of this destocking has now finally taken place and I think we'll have more predictability going forward relative to volume. Well, again you're always concerned about fiber costs and energy transportation especially on the rail, rail rates continue to move up. So it's \u2013 it's, and then as we go through the third into the fourth we'll be getting into the seasonal cooler months and, and energy usage along with \u2013 with cost pressure from that usage. So as wood cost is always a factor depending on weather conditions, so it's a continuing whole host of all your input and what's happening at any given time. John, this is Tom, I'll take this one. I would say that there are a couple of reasons why our numbers look like they do. Number one is we had unbelievably tough comps from a year ago. And if you go back, I mean, we were significantly higher than the industry even, even much than our normal trend. And I think that's because as I mentioned even back then, the wide segment of business and wide swath of different businesses whether they're local, national or what segments they're in all were up significantly during the COVID period. And as I just mentioned a while ago a number of those have come down significantly. And I'm talking \u2013 when I say significant, we haven't lost any \u2013 we haven't lost any of these customers, but we have some that are down 50-plus percent still at this rate just because there was so much demand during COVID and that demand has shrunk so significantly. So those are the \u2013 those to me are the main reasons why \u2013 why it looks as if we're lagging the industry probably more so than, and the numbers look so much different than they \u2013 than they have in the past. I'll be \u2013 I got to temper this a little bit in terms of discussing this. But what we're seeing is no, I would say no way is, is box \u2013 is the box trend worse than the linerboard medium trend. In fact, I would even say that our observations and what we've heard from our customers they've been quite surprised that of any linerboard medium reductions that have taken place. And I would say on the box side, it's very much the same thing. Okay, Anthony, relative to the July trends, let's, the one thing we've typically started out most quarters up quite a bit year-over-year. And that no different \u2013 no different this quarter but there's \u2013 there's a little more predictability in these numbers than what we've had in the past. And I'm seeing \u2013 I'm seeing our customer's trends of order patterns starting to come more in line with where they had been prior to all this destocking and this big change from after COVID. So that's \u2013 that's the best I can tell you about the July trends. I'm feeling better about these trends than, than in the past. And these numbers up and don't forget, I mean, when its bookings, you're talking about not just in the month of July, you're talking about August, September kind of out through the quarter.

Export's still a moving target and it's \u2013 it's certainly something that we're trying to get our arms around and it \u2013 and it seems to change almost on a daily basis in this \u2013 in this global demand.

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA and with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging Business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results, and then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. I'll then wrap things up, and then we'll be glad to take any questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $203 million, or $2.24 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2023 net income was $209 million, or $2.31 per share, compared to the second quarter of 2022 net income of $304 million, or $3.23 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter, excluding special items, was $418 million in 2023 and $533 million in 2022. Second quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.07 per share for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion related activities and closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and design centers. Details of special items for both the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.92 per share decrease in second quarter 2023 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower volumes in the Packaging segment for $0.90 and Paper segment $0.07. Lower price and mix in the Packaging segment of $0.47 and higher depreciation expense, $0.09, and higher other converting costs, $0.03. These items were partially offset by lower operating costs of $0.34, primarily driven by lower fiber, energy and chemical costs. We also had higher prices and mix in the Paper segment for $0.12, a lower share count resulting from the share repurchase in the second half of 2022 for $0.13; lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses for $0.03 and a lower tax rate for $0.02. The results were $0.35 above the second quarter guidance of $1.96 per share, primarily due to lower operating costs resulting from efficiency and usage initiatives and lower freight and logistics expenses. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA excluding special items in the second quarter of 2023 of $405 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 23% versus last year's EBITDA of $525 million and sales of $2.1 billion or a 25% EBITDA margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was about where we expected for the quarter, and Tom will discuss this further in a moment. As they did in the first quarter, our employees remain focused on very efficient and cost-effective operations as we balanced our supply according to the demand, or said another way we are extremely effective at managing what is in our control. In our mills, this included things like improving our wood yields, producing board closer to nominal basis weights, reducing fiber and chemical usage and running our pulp mills more efficiently, increasing our internal energy generation while also reducing our energy consumption and executing our planned maintenance outages for less cost than we had estimated. Also at our mills and including our corrugated facilities, we closely monitored headcount and overtime as well as usage of materials and supplies in addition to other discretionary spending items. In addition, our mills and plants, together with our logistics and distribution personnel worked effectively to minimize the negative impacts from rail rate increases at certain locations and changes in the mix of shipping locations as we ran our system to demand. Finally, as you know, we temporarily curtailed operations at our Wallula, Washington mill once we exited the planned maintenance outage early in the quarter. This was not a reaction to any change in our views on demand, but rather our thoughtful approach to manage containerboard supply as economically as possible. The mill remains temporarily curtailed and we will continue to monitor any potential changes to this strategy along with our outlook for demand during the second half of the year. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who'll provide more details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business. Thank you, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $39 million with sales of $143 million for a 27% margin compared to the second quarter of 2022 EBITDA of $32 million and sales of $150 million, or 21% margin. Paper prices and mix were 12% higher than last year's second quarter and less than 1% below the first quarter of 2023. Paper demand remains soft with our sales volume just over 14% below last year's second quarter, which also included some sales from our Jackson, Alabama mill, where there was no volume in this year's second quarter. We ran our International Falls mill to match supply with demand as well as to build some additional inventory during the quarter to prepare for the nine-day planned outage \u2013 maintenance outage that's coming up this third quarter. Similar to the comments I made regarding the Packaging business and for many of the same categories, employees in our Paper business remained focused on efficient and cost-effective operations as they also balance supply according to demand and delivered outstanding margins for the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second and into the third quarter, in our Packaging segment, although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect shipments per day to improve versus the second quarter. However, prices will be lower as a result of previously published domestic containerboard price decreases along with slightly lower export prices. We expect seasonally stronger volumes in our Paper segment from back-to-school shipments, although prices are expected to trend lower based on the recent declines in index prices. Operating converting costs should trend slightly higher, primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices and seasonal energy cost. Scheduled outage expenses will be higher by approximately $0.06 per share, driven by the scheduled maintenance outage at International Falls, Minnesota. Finally, we estimate that our depreciation expense and tax rate to be slightly higher as well. Considering these items, we expect the third quarter earnings of $1.88 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. Statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company. And involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K and on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call up for questions, please. George, as we always do, we continue to focus on 365 days a year, continuous improvement, operational excellence. One thing we commented on last year as we were moving into 2023 and we are winding down a lot of the major capital projects, we're going to take the approximately 150 engineers and technology personnel in our corporate technology group and really let them focus now on unit operations optimization and really work with the box plants and mills on a lot of the new equipment, quite frankly, that have been installed in the last couple of years, but really take that to a new level of performance and execution. And that's paid off for us this year, as you can see. So my answer is we will continue in that effort. Nothing is guaranteed, but we do obviously perform quite well in general. And I would expect to see similar results going forward. Tom, Bob from your perspective. Tom? George let me just... George let me add one thing. If you looked at our quarter and you looked at month by month, we were running in not just one mill, but most of the mill system, we were pushing 99% uptime efficiency, operational efficiency in our mills. I mean, that's unheard of in the industry. Month of June, we had most of the mills in that category, and we had we had one mill in particular that was like basically 99.99% uptime efficient. It had no paper breaks. And so, we're in a level now, it's obviously not many of our competitors are there, but that's what we strive to do every day and make it better and better. And so I'm confident we'll continue to see good results. No, that's the beauty of it. We're continuing to execute every week on a number of opportunities within the box plants, new equipment installations, new equipment \u2013 significant rebuilds modifications on a lot of the production lines. So, this is not stopping. The mills, as we talked about, we wound up most of the big work at Wallula mill last year and the woodyard work in the OCC plant, Jackson, Alabama, most of that work has wound up, we're just waiting for the opportunity to move into the final phase of the number three machine at Jackson. But again, we can do all of that and still keep the capital spending in this $400 million range. That provides us an opportunity to really just move forward as we look at what these \u2013 whether it's a customer-driven opportunity, or a cost take out efficiency, energy efficiency, labor efficiency, we continue to see those opportunities. And where we are right now like I say, barring some big one-off opportunity, some $400 million number keeps us moving forward with taking advantage of this. Bob? Okay. Next question, please. Yes. I would just \u2013 I would just add that. I would just add that. We were up about 3% Q2-over-Q1 and the trend line continues to look quite favorable. So we'll \u2013 and the beauty of \u2013 the beauty of what we've done and what we talked about on the operating side is that we can flex now however we need to and to whatever the demands are and do it very cost effectively. Thank you. Next question, please. Good morning, Anthony. Yes. Yes. As we were running through the first quarter and into the second quarter, we were running the mills in many cases slowed back and just kind of throttling our way through demand. As we got into the springtime and we had our outages taking place, we were into the Wallula outage and we didn't see the improvement at that time back in April with demand. And so we quickly reassessed our position and realized that it was far better to take the six mills that we currently have running and run them very, very efficiently. And then in order to do that, you had to take Wallula and keep it down. So we were \u2013 we had Wallula down for the annual outage. So we finished that work and, and decided to just temporarily idle that mill for the time being as, as we watched the demand situation. But by doing that, it allowed us to take the six other containerboard mills and really optimize them and speed them up to the optimum point on their production curve and take advantage of that, and that's another part of the benefit we saw in the second quarter earnings. Next question, please. Again thank you for joining us today on the call, and look forward to talking to you when we wrap up our third quarter and have our call in October. Have a good day. Thank you."

            "name": "Bob Mundy",
            "content": "Thanks Mark. For the quarter, we generated new second quarter records for cash from operations of $360 million as well as free cash flow of $233 million. Key cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $126 million, common stock dividends of $112 million, cash taxes of $83 million, and net interest payments of $30 million. We ended the quarter with $630 million of marketable securities and cash on hand with liquidity of almost $1 billion. I'll now turn it back to Mark. Yes, Mark, it's \u2013 this is Bob. George, I'll say that from the operating cost perspective, we'll hold on to really the performance we had in the second quarter. If you just assume that that production volume in the mills is similar to the second, maybe up a little bit, we'll see. Yet, we think our cost per ton stays relatively flat. So to be able to hold on to that even though we know OCC prices will be higher, if you just take the average, they moved up from the end of the second quarter and just supply that across the third quarter, they're up like 12% or 14%. So we'll overcome that plus we have the seasonal electricity rates that hits you as well as some seasonal usage items. So in effect, we'll pretty much be offsetting that by continuing the excellent operating cost performance in the mills and the box plants. Yes, George, regarding the price, I guess a way to think about it is in the first quarter there were two drops in prices that occurred during the quarter on the benchmark grade for $30 a ton. And then the second \u2013 and \u2013 the impact of that is, as we say, it pretty much runs through over a 90-day period. So, the bulk of that was reflected in our second quarter numbers. So, if you think about what occurred in the second quarter where there was a $20 drop and you sort of ratio that with what happened in the first with the $30 drop, you can sort of get the impact of price in the third quarter. Does that make sense? For the fourth quarter most of it will be from the latest drop will be in the third. And the impact will be, like I said, if you sort of compare that to what happened in the first, we gave you the impact of... I mean, yes, in the second quarter. And then, so in the \u2013 you would think \u2013 if no other changes, the fourth should be \u2013 you shouldn't see much of an impact if things sort of hang out where they are right now. Next question, please. Yes, Mark over a year ago actually we started getting people thinking about the fact that the heavy projects were winding up, the big projects that we had been involved in over the last ten years were really coming to fruition. And that 2023 would be a year that we wound that capital down in the $400 million range, last year we were $824 million of capital spending. And we would \u2013 again we alerted everybody that this year would be in that $400 million level, and that's where we are. I fully expect us to finish the year somewhere in that $400 million area. And then we're already talking about the 2024 capital spending plan. And looking at our needs and the opportunities, we feel comfortable right now that the number will continue to be in that $400 million area unless some opportunity came along that was so outstanding that we felt compelled that we wanted to direct our capital into that opportunity. So, we have that luxury right now. But I think for the benefit of running the business on certain times we're in $400 million range is a good range to be in, and it supports business improvement opportunities along with maintenance capital spending within the mills and box plants. Just one other thing, Mark, is a lot of the operating cost improvement and things that you're seeing it's not necessarily capital related, it's just doing things within the process, watching usage, watching your routines, behaviors, practices, improving upon where you've been before and a lot of that is not capital driven, it's just there is a huge benefit of our operating costs is managed just by those things as well. Mark, over the last few years, we were doing hundreds of projects in our box plants and mills on an annual basis. Granted a lot of them are smaller projects, but literally we had our entire workforce moving to make improvements in hundreds and hundreds of areas every year. And now that we've been able to slow this process down, we're able to take advantage of that. And now the personnel can really take a much closer look and a deeper dive in how is that equipment running. And from a unit operations effectiveness and efficiency the operating personnel at the plants and the mills, the technology organization, are now really stepping back and looking at all of the new converting lines, the projects at the mills and really assessing are these projects doing what we expected them to do and if not, how do we make it do what we expect it to do? And if they are optimizing and fine tuning and the benefits are what we've seen in the second quarter is a great example. And we'll continue to do that, Yes. I think you are pretty close, Mark if you looked at those two items on the \u2013 well just look at the price and the outages maybe a little bit different than what you were saying, but there is almost probably 90% of the delta right there. And then on the operating call side, if you take in some of the other things that to offset the higher recycle fiber prices and the energy costs that we spoke of, it's, hopefully will be pretty close to a push. And so what you're left with are just a couple of cents here and there. We talked about depreciation, we put that in our release, and that just has to do higher depreciation from the second quarter, just has to do with the timing of placing our assets in service based from our capital spending program. And we had some benefits in the second quarter that won't repeat in the third. On the tax side, there were just some favorable tax items from the vesting of stock and performance units, as well as some state tax law changes that gave us a benefit that don't repeat themselves. So, those are the other few items that get used to that 40 \u2013 $0.43 change. Okay. Next question, please. Our volume was pretty much what we expected it to be with which was slightly improving in June, quite frankly was very strong. So we felt pretty good as, as the quarter moved \u2013 moved through the months, and again we saw that in June and we're continuing to see that in July. So I'm not sure... And I'll just add that the economic downtime was pretty much what we had anticipated it to be. So there was no \u2013 no change there from what we were assuming. On a per ton \u2013 on a per day basis it's up. It's up. So I think Tom made some comments about what he's seeing as far as trends now and so forth. So hopefully that that means from on a total basis, even though there's one less day that, that could be something that some tailwind there that hopefully we can \u2013 we can realize in our numbers. Well, again we'll \u2013 we'll have to see. That's \u2013 that's always a moving target, but I would say in total, because we do have less scheduled outages as far from a ton perspective. So we get tons back from that in the third versus the second. There's an additional day of in the mill so you get another day there, so there's another 15,000 tons or so. So, and we'll just manage the, the economic downtime commiserate with that pickup that we're seeing from the second quarter."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results. And then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob will provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $190 million or $2.11 per share. Excluding special items, first quarter 2023, net income was $198 million or $2.20 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022 net income of $256 million or $2.72 per share. First quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2023 and $2.1 billion in 2022. The Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $405 million in 2023 and $467 million in 2022. The First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.09 per share, primarily; for the closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and design centers. Details of special items for both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.52 per share decrease in first quarter 2023 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower volumes in our Packaging segment for $0.95, and Paper segment $0.04. Although recycled fiber costs were lower than last year. Overall operating costs were 27% -- $0.27 higher, primarily due to inflation on chemicals, labor and benefits, supplies, repair materials and services. Energy costs, although trending down, were also higher versus the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we had higher depreciation expense of $0.11, freight and logistics expenses, $0.04; nonoperating pension expenses, $0.04; and higher converting costs, $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment for $0.58 and Paper segment $0.18. A lower share count resulting from share repurchases we made in the second quarter of 2022 for $0.11, lower interest expense, $0.03; lower other expenses for $0.03, lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses for $0.01, and lower tax rate, $0.01. The results were $0.03 below the first quarter guidance of $2.23 and per share, primarily due to the lower volume and lower prices and mix in the Packaging segment. Looking at our Packaging segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter 2023, of $392 million with sales of $1.81 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $464 million and sales of $1.96 billion or 23.6% margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was well below our expectations for the quarter. Tom will discuss this further in a moment. The mills and corrugated products plants responded to the lower demand by remaining highly focused on efficient and cost-effective operations as we balanced our supply accordingly. Our employees continue to deliver on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, integration and optimization enhancements and capital project benefits to not only minimize the negative demand impacts on the short term but also to remain in position to capitalize on our longer-term strategic goals. The accomplishments were achieved while building less inventory than we had planned and staying committed to ending the quarter at our targeted weeks of supply inventory. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.\nThomas Hassfurther: Thanks, Mark. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix were $0.64 per share above the first quarter of 2022 and were down $0.50 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Export Containerboard prices were down $0.06 per share versus last year's first quarter and down $0.04 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Corrugated product shipments were down 12.7% in total and per workday compared to last year's first quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 69,000 tons below last year's first quarter and 33,000 tons above the fourth quarter of 2022. With the first quarter of 2022 setting a shipments per workday record as well as being our all-time record for total shipments, we knew this would be a tough comparison period. However, that being said, the lower demand in our Packaging segment that Mark spoke of was driven by several items, the combined impact of which resulted in our volumes being much lower than we anticipated. As we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, it was difficult to predict the demand curve given the numerous variables with varying degrees of impact. As noted in our earnings release yesterday, the shift of consumer buying preferences more towards service-oriented spending, persistent inflation and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and nondurable goods. In addition, there is a varying degree of inventory destocking across our customer bases, both in boxes and our customers' products. The inventory destocking situation has been a longer-term issue than we originally anticipated. The manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for several months now. And as you know, we have a large presence in the ag business in the Pacific Northwest and also down in Florida, where both of these regions have been dealing with significant weather events. As we look to the second quarter, we expect the inventory destocking of both customer product and boxes to be near completion. We expect to see recovery in our ag business and we have received some positive feedback from our customers regarding improvements in their business. Our April volume, as we see it today supports that position. I'd also like to point out that the capital spending and optimization strategy within our box plant system that we have been focused on over the last few years continues to remain one of our top priorities. The current demand trends will not cause us to lose our focus in this area. The investments from this strategy provide the products and service needs that our customers desire and allows them to grow while focusing on the mix of customers, we want to profitably grow our revenues with. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter was $41 million with sales of $151 million or a 27.2% margin, compared to the first quarter of 2022 EBITDA of $29 million and sales of $153 million or an 18.9% margin. Paper prices and mix were 18% higher than last year's first quarter and about 3% above for the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales volume was about 17% below last year's first quarter which included some of the inventory that had been sold from our Jackson Alabama mill and just over 4.5% below the fourth quarter of 2022. The efforts of our employees to optimize the cost structure inventory and product mix in our paper business helped minimize the inflationary cost increases compared to last year and delivered solid returns for the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nRobert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. For the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $280 million and free cash flow of $168 million. Fee cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $112 million and common stock dividends of $112 million. We ended the quarter with $520 million of cash on hand, including marketable securities. I want to update you on a revision to the scheduled mill maintenance outage guidance we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and the scope of work for the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills has changed, resulting in a revised total company estimated cost impact for the year of $0.75 per share versus the $0.67 per share we mentioned previously. The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.13 per share. And the revised estimate impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.18 per share in the second quarter, $0.24 in the third and $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter, although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect improved volume in our Packaging segment. However, prices will be lower as a result of the previously published domestic containerboard price decreases along with lower export prices. Sales volume as well as prices and mix in the Paper segment are assumed to be slightly lower based on lower demand. Although we do look for most operating costs to trend lower, our converting costs, scheduled maintenance outage expense and depreciation expense will be higher, primarily due to recent increases in contract rail rates at most of our mills, we expect higher freight and logistics expenses compared to the first quarter. Considering these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $1.96 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call up for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks for the details. Mark, a question for you. Normally 2Q is up sequentially from 1Q. And when we look back historically over time, the only time that we saw a down 2Q, if we're correct, was the COVID second quarter, even if we went back to the, the great recession in '08 and '09, you had up 2Q versus 1Q. As you sit here today and if you're in our seat, what is the biggest driver of the drop off 2Q versus 1Q. Is it the timing effect on the pricing and just how that's flowing through? Or is it the demand affect the continued demand effect being worse than expected. If you could give us some qualitative comments on that, that would be helpful. And then a couple of follow-ons.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, George, let me start that out. I think, again, if you look at the November, December and February, price decreases, and how they've rolled in.  I think in the past 20-plus years, we only had 1 or 2 incidents of this kind of timing of price decreases. But Bob can give you some real detailed color on how that's impacting, but that's pretty much what's happening.\nRobert Mundy: You're right, Mark. And in the magnitude, that $70, George, the timing of that, as you look at going from 1Q to 2Q, it's just -- that's unprecedented in the company's history. And we mentioned on last quarter's call that the vast majority of those price declines would show up in the second quarter. And that's exactly what's happening. So it's sort of an unprecedented drop in price just based on the timing of the published decreases is really what's driving that. And that's pretty much the answer.\nGeorge Staphos: Understood. And I appreciate the color there. Could you give us a sense for how much demand might have been off relative to your prior expectations and what the bookings and billings look like early in 2Q?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Tom, why don't you go ahead and take a...\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, George. Let me give you a little -- let me give you color on that. If you recall on our call last quarter, we were starting out in January pretty decent in the bookings. And as the quarter rolled on, I mean, it just got a little bit weaker each month. So that was disappointing. And of course, what I told you back then was it was impossible to predict what was happening in the destocking and what was really happening in terms of consumer demand. And if you look all those indicators, whether it was consumer demand or the manufacturing index, the Purchasing Managers Index they all really kind of got more negative as the months went on and correlated exactly with kind of what the volume situation was. The good news is, is that there's been a big turnaround starting in April. And so we've got a good look 13 days into the month. And our bookings right now just over March alone are up 11%, and they're up 10% over the first quarter. Still down 6% compared to April of '22, but April of '22 was our all-time record. So just to calibrate everybody, the volume continued to increase significantly because of COVID all the way through April and then finally started to turn the other way. So we've still got that really tough comp coming in the month of April. But given the fact that we're double digits ahead of where we are in March is a huge improvement. And it's across all of the sectors. Now we've still got some laggards in there. If you talk home improvement or you talk home building or some of these other areas, but the other big plus for us is that we suffered badly in that first quarter in that ag business as we alluded to, down in Florida from the hurricanes. In Northern California from the significant rain and flooding that they had, and of course, in the Pacific Northwest because of the cold weather. And that's coming back as well. So I think that we've got some -- I think we're towards the end of that big problem relative to the volume situation.\nGeorge Staphos: Last quick one, I'll turn it over. Just from an operations standpoint. Can you talk a little bit about the facility closures, kind of what they're allowing or optimizing for PCA. And given the shift in recycled cost versus virgin cost, this question comes up periodically on your calls. How are you flexing your system relative to lower-cost recycled and lower-cost recycled board, recognizing your customers ultimately dictate what kind of box they want that ultimately dictates the Board. I'll let it go there.\nThomas Hassfurther: Okay. Thanks, George. Yes, relative to the plant and the design center closure that we announced in the first quarter, that is typical of the evaluation that we do of our footprint at all times, and it's part of our capital planning process. So these are not knee-jerk reactions to let's just say, volume demand change or anything like that. These are all part of our capital planning process where we're trying to optimize our system. Of course, we've made acquisitions over the years and other things like that. So we do have -- we do have some duplicity in some of the markets that we want to fix. And so it's been a continuous process that we've been doing this. Relative to the recycled versus virgin what PCA has been, and I've said this before, what we have been focused on for years now in our mill system is to be able to match the -- just the right amount of fiber to the performance that's necessary in the marketplace. And some of those proprietary products and some of the things that we've done in our mill system has served us incredibly well in the marketplace and is ultimately even more competitive than recycled than most of those in virtually all of those markets. So I'm very, very pleased with what we've been able to do in the mill system. It's been an outstanding performance by all of our people. And we've talked about our engineering expertise. We've talked about our paper tech expertise, and that's provided us. And of course, the flexibility we have in these mills, and we will flex back and forth, obviously, with OCC to the degree we can when the prices of a nature that, that makes the most sense.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners.\nMark Weintraub: Good to hear that demand looking better in April, but I did want to follow up a little bit on George's question, and I realize it's a bit of an overlap. But in the third quarter and the fourth quarter as well, your year-over-year box shipments were a bit below the industry. And we don't have the industry data yet, we'll get that, I guess, on Friday. But certainly, the 12.7% was surprised us to the downside and you guys as well. As if you look back over the last 6 months or so, any thoughts as to why you might have been showing reduced market share, recognizing that over time, you've actually outgrown the industry very substantially and very profitably. And whether it's this ag business? Or what are you coming up with in terms as to what might have been going on with your book of business?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Mark, just remember back in 2008 into the 2009 period, we saw a more rapid downturn in volume than our competitors. And then when we started seeing the improvement in the spring, we came back stronger and faster than our competitors. And I believe most of that has to do with the predominantly local book specialized local accounts, smaller local account business that we have. These accounts are much more tuned into what's happening with their own business. They can move very quickly. They're very nimble. But I'm going to let Tom elaborate on that because, again, it's not as simple as it seems.\nThomas Hassfurther: Yes, Mark. I think that the -- one of the things that I think is really important is, number 1 is we haven't lost any volume. So we're not losing any market share. That's not taking place. But if you think about the thing that we've talked about many times and we take great pride in is the broad base of business that we have and the broad base of sectors that we deal across. Now in this particular -- during COVID, we had some of those sectors were up as much as 200%. And once COVID ended, of course, those are going to be down significantly. So it just depends on the sector. And that's why we've had to sort through this volume situation a little longer than what we would have hoped. But -- you do have a lot of these -- some of these various sectors are down significantly. Some of them have stayed level, some of them are up slightly. But for the most part, that's the biggest factor. The other thing that we did during COVID is we had to run a lot of business that we could not get supplied from the outside, which we traditionally would have done. And we now have that business placed back on the outside again. So even though we keep the revenue and we keep the income, it's a drag on our volume. And that's just kind of funny math, if you will, based on the way it has to be reported to the FBA, but that's another factor that's affecting us. Does that help?\nMark Weintraub: It does. Just 2 quick follow-ups. One is you mentioned not lost volume -- were you basically think you haven't lost customers, obviously, your volumes are down?\nThomas Hassfurther: We haven't lost any customers in terms of what you would call market share in terms of customers or things like that. Obviously, our volume is down. But it's down. We haven't lost any share within those accounts or anything like that. It's just that some of that broad-based business, some of those sectors are down significantly. And as I mentioned, we've never had a period where we got hit with ag getting hit like it did in the regions where we have big footprints all at the same time.\nMark Weintraub: Got it. And then just maybe a little bit of clarification. Why would you -- given that demand has been weak and you certainly have the capability to have fulfilled needs, which maybe were being fulfilled from the outside and now apparently, you're fulfilling from the outside. I guess I'm a little puzzled why you would, given you've got plenty of capability, I would think, to meet it internally or maybe I don't understand exactly.\nThomas Hassfurther: Well, the reason is because we have to produce that at a much higher cost than we can get done on the outside. And so it doesn't make sense for us to do that. But in order to take care of our customers, we opted to do it at a much higher cost point. So that's why we're doing it. And of course, we want to maintain the -- run our plants as efficiently as we possibly can. So it's just from a cost standpoint makes the most sense.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is John on for Phil. Appreciate all the details. And I want to first start off asking how much economic downtime you guys took in 1Q given the last couple of quarters, you've called that out, and it's been a bit outsized. Is that something you can quantify? And maybe how can we think about trends for that in 2Q with some of the demand starting to normalize?\nRobert Mundy: Yes. It was about 110,000 tons in the first quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And any insights on how to think about 2Q?\nMark Kowlzan: No. We just -- as we've always done, we're just going to run to demand and do what we've got to do to satisfy our customer base. If you go back and look at the first quarter, when we were in the January period of time, anticipated volume was starting to settle down and improve. We anticipated going through our winter spring annual shutdowns that would have greater need. So our plan was to build a little more inventory. As a matter of fact, I think the number was about 30,000 tons more inventory through the first quarter that we ended the year last year. But in fact, as we saw the deteriorating volume in -- especially in February and March, we certainly didn't need that extra volume. So we trimmed back and scaled back operations and only ended up 6,000 tons at the end of 1Q as opposed to where we thought it would be. So again, we'll just continue running to demand.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to pivot over to the cost side. You guys have done a very good job taking out cost in the system. But in terms of the guidance. Just a couple of questions. First, I want to get a better understanding of what's driving the higher converting costs. Is that maybe more on the labor side? And then on the rail rate increases. Is that something that you can maybe give us a little bit better understanding of the structure of those contracts? Like how long those rates will kind of be in place when they get renegotiated? How much maybe it was weighing on 1Q and going into 2Q? Just to give us some better tools to forecast the models have.\nRobert Mundy: Yes, John, it's Bob. As far as on the rail rate increases, most of that is -- some of it occurred during the first quarter, and then we had some that just started at the beginning of the second. So it's a large impact as you move from 1Q to 2Q because you'll have all of those pretty much higher as we start the second quarter. So that's what's driving the freight cost higher. I'm sorry, your first question was.\nUnidentified Analyst: I guess, just to stay on that for a second, are those contracted rates for the next year, the next couple of years?\nRobert Mundy: Yes, typically. Typically, that's probably a good way to think about it.\nUnidentified Analyst: And the first question was around the converting costs and what's driving higher converting costs.\nRobert Mundy: Yes, really labor benefits, obviously, with just -- that's just -- that's part of it. The other is really at starch. Starch prices are just skyrocketed and that is something that we had another big increase this year. And as we expect to -- our volume to start improving in the box plants and so forth, and you're using more of those types of things. And so that's what's driving labor and some of your some of your material costs that are also included in that converting number.\nUnidentified Analyst: Is the starch starting to turn over? Or is it still..\nRobert Mundy: No. No, it's not.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, I appreciate the insight, thank you all.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Kraft liner prices have been stable for a couple of months now. And understanding you don't sell much board in the open market, and I'm not asking about forward pricing. But I'm just wondering if you had any thoughts about kind of where containerboard markets kind of feel like they are right now.  I mean, you've seen a number of cycles maybe some of these capacity projects have started up and maybe are being sort of absorbed. I just wanted to get your sense of containerboard markets versus maybe where we were a few months ago?\nThomas Hassfurther: Anthony, this is Tom. I'll take this one. Yes, prices have stabilized. There's no question about it. In fact, I can make an argument that there hasn't been -- there really hasn't been a whole lot of activity relative to price in the past. And I'm not a predictor of price going forward, but I can just tell you that I think the outlook is more positive.  Of course, you've seen the industry really adjust dramatically to demand. And as I've said many times, I mean, the open market is a small open market today. So those that have excess capacity are either taking the downtime or they're looking to export markets to try to figure out how to sell into those markets. Which are also under some duress. But I think that the -- I think the market in general is different than the past, given the small open market that we have today. And I think that leads towards much more stability.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just -- I wonder if you could talk a little bit, given the balance sheet flexibility that you have about capital allocation, and from a capital return perspective, I mean, you're paying an attractive dividend. I don't know if you can talk about maybe opportunities for repurchases. And then in terms of investing in the business, you're coming off maybe a big CapEx cycle where you're doing a lot of internal projects. Just wondering if you could kind of talk about where you're seeing the opportunities in capital allocation and capital return this year.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, nothing's changed. As we've talked about for the last year, our plans were to bring capital down this year, and we're in that $400 million range. And I would anticipate that working through into next year. Also, we've done most of the big projects that we could foresee in the mills, and we're just going to continue with the box plant optimization. As far as utilization of cash in terms of other opportunities like dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions. We'll remain flexible on any and all opportunities in that regard as we go forward. As we've done for many, many years, now, we've got that flexibility to take advantage of all of these opportunities as they present themselves. And that's how we look at it day to day.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities.\nGeorge Staphos: Actually, Anthony took my next question. So I will turn it over to the next person.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is also a follow-up from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners.\nMark Weintraub: I was thinking a little bit about how -- I believe your volumes ended up being down about twice what you had anticipated back in January. I think you'd been talking about flat average day and so it would have been like 6% or 7% down and you ended up down 12.7%. Is it fair to -- therefore, if you talked about the negative impact year-over-year on volumes being about $0.95.  So if I just took half of that, had you -- was that the incremental negative impact from the additional demand weakness that you experienced so that had, in fact, the volumes come through as you anticipated. In theory, you might have been closer to $2.70, particularly if we add the fact that you had the pricing down by $20 in February, which would have had some small impact. And then if that is the case and everybody maybe that math doesn't work. But if that was the case, that's a huge difference from sort of the $2.23, and presumably that relates to all the operating adjustments that you had made.  I'm sort of just trying to get a sense as to whether that's something you couldn't hang on to or those were measures taken because of what was going on in the business? And maybe a little bit less certain types of spend that you could defer. So sort of just trying to get a sense of that underlying earnings power in a future type of environment.\nRobert Mundy: Yes. Mark, this is Bob. So there's a lot going on there. If you're saying if our volumes were higher, it were closer to what we had anticipated, you're looking at that $0.95 being something a lot larger?\nMark Weintraub: Well, I believe you had stated during the January call that you were looking for average daily box shipments to be flat in -- sequentially, which would have suggested about down 6.5% rather than the down 12.7%. And -- so basically, I'm saying, well, does that mean that instead of being a $0.95 negative hit, it would have been about half of that, like a $0.47 negative hit.\nRobert Mundy: That volume is -- it's not just box shipments, right? It's -- there's export volume, there's trade, there's domestic outside volume. So that would not be a good way to look at it. However, directionally, yes, it would be a higher number. But you would also have a lot better probably cost within your system because your mills would be running more full. Your box plants would be running more full. So you're converting costs, your direct variable costs, all those types of things, your unabsorbed costs would not be as high would more than offset any additional decline that you would see in that price variance, if that makes sense, because of higher volumes.\nMark Weintraub: It does, but it sort of comes back to the point that you're only $0.03 off what your guidance had been.\nRobert Mundy: Yes. And if you want to look at it sort of simply the published price dropped $20 a ton after we gave our guidance. And if you sort of do the math, on that. And as we said before, when that price -- the published price drops, it pretty much hits our outside containerboard immediately. There's no delay. So if you sort of do the math, there's about $0.03 just from that price decline that occurred after we gave our guidance.\nMark Weintraub: Right. And so what I'm trying to get to is if we get this sort of rebound in demand and what it would seem that our -- the bounce back in earnings could be very dramatic relative to sort of that $2.23 type of run rate you had suggested in a down.\nMark Kowlzan: Absolutely, Mark. Absolutely. That's what we would anticipate.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. I apologize for the fairly convoluted questioning here. But thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is also a follow-up from Phil Ng from Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is john again. I appreciate you taking the follow-up. I just wanted to quickly shift over to the paper segment. Demand was a bit lower than we had expected. Just kind of looking to get some insights on how the paper segment volumes are trending. It looks like maybe this next quarter where we should see another down double-digit type of volume year-over-year. Just kind of what's going on and maybe what are the main factors impacting demand on the paper side.\nMark Kowlzan: Again, as we spoke last year that we -- our paper business now has become just the International Falls mill up in Minnesota, and that mill is capable of a little over 500,000 tons a year. And that's pretty much what we're selling too. We're down slightly off of that peak capability. But what that allows us to do really is just run and optimize the market and where we choose to sell and where we want to sell to maximize profit. So we really have the luxury of being the fourth largest player and we don't have to do anything. I say we're in a real sweet spot right now, down just a few thousand tons off of where we were last year. Any other questions, please?\nOperator: And our final question comes from George Staphos. Once again, a follow-up from Bank of America Securities. George?\nGeorge Staphos: Sorry, you've got a technical issue here. So I just want to reaffirm the guidance on the paper segment is for pricing and volume to be down slightly sequentially. Was that the comment, Mark? And Tom -- and Bob? Thanks very much and good luck in the quarter.\nRobert Mundy: Yes, George. That's correct.\nGeorge Staphos: Excellent, thanks guys, good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you George.\nOperator: Mr. Kowlzan, I see no more questions at this time. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today, and appreciate your time, and we look forward to talking with you in July and covering the second quarter earnings results. Have a nice day. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Thomas Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix were $0.64 per share above the first quarter of 2022 and were down $0.50 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Export Containerboard prices were down $0.06 per share versus last year's first quarter and down $0.04 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Corrugated product shipments were down 12.7% in total and per workday compared to last year's first quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 69,000 tons below last year's first quarter and 33,000 tons above the fourth quarter of 2022. With the first quarter of 2022 setting a shipments per workday record as well as being our all-time record for total shipments, we knew this would be a tough comparison period. However, that being said, the lower demand in our Packaging segment that Mark spoke of was driven by several items, the combined impact of which resulted in our volumes being much lower than we anticipated. As we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, it was difficult to predict the demand curve given the numerous variables with varying degrees of impact. As noted in our earnings release yesterday, the shift of consumer buying preferences more towards service-oriented spending, persistent inflation and higher interest rates continue to negatively impact consumers' purchases of both durable and nondurable goods. In addition, there is a varying degree of inventory destocking across our customer bases, both in boxes and our customers' products. The inventory destocking situation has been a longer-term issue than we originally anticipated. The manufacturing index has remained in contraction territory for several months now. And as you know, we have a large presence in the ag business in the Pacific Northwest and also down in Florida, where both of these regions have been dealing with significant weather events. As we look to the second quarter, we expect the inventory destocking of both customer product and boxes to be near completion. We expect to see recovery in our ag business and we have received some positive feedback from our customers regarding improvements in their business. Our April volume, as we see it today supports that position. I'd also like to point out that the capital spending and optimization strategy within our box plant system that we have been focused on over the last few years continues to remain one of our top priorities. The current demand trends will not cause us to lose our focus in this area. The investments from this strategy provide the products and service needs that our customers desire and allows them to grow while focusing on the mix of customers, we want to profitably grow our revenues with. I'll now turn it back to Mark. Yes, George. Let me give you a little -- let me give you color on that. If you recall on our call last quarter, we were starting out in January pretty decent in the bookings. And as the quarter rolled on, I mean, it just got a little bit weaker each month. So that was disappointing. And of course, what I told you back then was it was impossible to predict what was happening in the destocking and what was really happening in terms of consumer demand. And if you look all those indicators, whether it was consumer demand or the manufacturing index, the Purchasing Managers Index they all really kind of got more negative as the months went on and correlated exactly with kind of what the volume situation was. The good news is, is that there's been a big turnaround starting in April. And so we've got a good look 13 days into the month. And our bookings right now just over March alone are up 11%, and they're up 10% over the first quarter. Still down 6% compared to April of '22, but April of '22 was our all-time record. So just to calibrate everybody, the volume continued to increase significantly because of COVID all the way through April and then finally started to turn the other way. So we've still got that really tough comp coming in the month of April. But given the fact that we're double digits ahead of where we are in March is a huge improvement. And it's across all of the sectors. Now we've still got some laggards in there. If you talk home improvement or you talk home building or some of these other areas, but the other big plus for us is that we suffered badly in that first quarter in that ag business as we alluded to, down in Florida from the hurricanes. In Northern California from the significant rain and flooding that they had, and of course, in the Pacific Northwest because of the cold weather. And that's coming back as well. So I think that we've got some -- I think we're towards the end of that big problem relative to the volume situation. Okay. Thanks, George. Yes, relative to the plant and the design center closure that we announced in the first quarter, that is typical of the evaluation that we do of our footprint at all times, and it's part of our capital planning process. So these are not knee-jerk reactions to let's just say, volume demand change or anything like that. These are all part of our capital planning process where we're trying to optimize our system. Of course, we've made acquisitions over the years and other things like that. So we do have -- we do have some duplicity in some of the markets that we want to fix. And so it's been a continuous process that we've been doing this. Relative to the recycled versus virgin what PCA has been, and I've said this before, what we have been focused on for years now in our mill system is to be able to match the -- just the right amount of fiber to the performance that's necessary in the marketplace. And some of those proprietary products and some of the things that we've done in our mill system has served us incredibly well in the marketplace and is ultimately even more competitive than recycled than most of those in virtually all of those markets. So I'm very, very pleased with what we've been able to do in the mill system. It's been an outstanding performance by all of our people. And we've talked about our engineering expertise. We've talked about our paper tech expertise, and that's provided us. And of course, the flexibility we have in these mills, and we will flex back and forth, obviously, with OCC to the degree we can when the prices of a nature that, that makes the most sense. Yes, Mark. I think that the -- one of the things that I think is really important is, number 1 is we haven't lost any volume. So we're not losing any market share. That's not taking place. But if you think about the thing that we've talked about many times and we take great pride in is the broad base of business that we have and the broad base of sectors that we deal across. Now in this particular -- during COVID, we had some of those sectors were up as much as 200%. And once COVID ended, of course, those are going to be down significantly. So it just depends on the sector. And that's why we've had to sort through this volume situation a little longer than what we would have hoped. But -- you do have a lot of these -- some of these various sectors are down significantly. Some of them have stayed level, some of them are up slightly. But for the most part, that's the biggest factor. The other thing that we did during COVID is we had to run a lot of business that we could not get supplied from the outside, which we traditionally would have done. And we now have that business placed back on the outside again. So even though we keep the revenue and we keep the income, it's a drag on our volume. And that's just kind of funny math, if you will, based on the way it has to be reported to the FBA, but that's another factor that's affecting us. Does that help? We haven't lost any customers in terms of what you would call market share in terms of customers or things like that. Obviously, our volume is down. But it's down. We haven't lost any share within those accounts or anything like that. It's just that some of that broad-based business, some of those sectors are down significantly. And as I mentioned, we've never had a period where we got hit with ag getting hit like it did in the regions where we have big footprints all at the same time. Well, the reason is because we have to produce that at a much higher cost than we can get done on the outside. And so it doesn't make sense for us to do that. But in order to take care of our customers, we opted to do it at a much higher cost point. So that's why we're doing it. And of course, we want to maintain the -- run our plants as efficiently as we possibly can. So it's just from a cost standpoint makes the most sense. Anthony, this is Tom. I'll take this one. Yes, prices have stabilized. There's no question about it. In fact, I can make an argument that there hasn't been -- there really hasn't been a whole lot of activity relative to price in the past. And I'm not a predictor of price going forward, but I can just tell you that I think the outlook is more positive.  Of course, you've seen the industry really adjust dramatically to demand. And as I've said many times, I mean, the open market is a small open market today. So those that have excess capacity are either taking the downtime or they're looking to export markets to try to figure out how to sell into those markets. Which are also under some duress. But I think that the -- I think the market in general is different than the past, given the small open market that we have today. And I think that leads towards much more stability."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results. And then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob will provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $190 million or $2.11 per share. Excluding special items, first quarter 2023, net income was $198 million or $2.20 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022 net income of $256 million or $2.72 per share. First quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2023 and $2.1 billion in 2022. The Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $405 million in 2023 and $467 million in 2022. The First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.09 per share, primarily; for the closure costs related to corrugated products facilities and design centers. Details of special items for both the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.52 per share decrease in first quarter 2023 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2022 was driven primarily by lower volumes in our Packaging segment for $0.95, and Paper segment $0.04. Although recycled fiber costs were lower than last year. Overall operating costs were 27% -- $0.27 higher, primarily due to inflation on chemicals, labor and benefits, supplies, repair materials and services. Energy costs, although trending down, were also higher versus the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we had higher depreciation expense of $0.11, freight and logistics expenses, $0.04; nonoperating pension expenses, $0.04; and higher converting costs, $0.02. These items were partially offset by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment for $0.58 and Paper segment $0.18. A lower share count resulting from share repurchases we made in the second quarter of 2022 for $0.11, lower interest expense, $0.03; lower other expenses for $0.03, lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses for $0.01, and lower tax rate, $0.01. The results were $0.03 below the first quarter guidance of $2.23 and per share, primarily due to the lower volume and lower prices and mix in the Packaging segment. Looking at our Packaging segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter 2023, of $392 million with sales of $1.81 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $464 million and sales of $1.96 billion or 23.6% margin. Demand in the Packaging segment was well below our expectations for the quarter. Tom will discuss this further in a moment. The mills and corrugated products plants responded to the lower demand by remaining highly focused on efficient and cost-effective operations as we balanced our supply accordingly. Our employees continue to deliver on numerous cost reduction initiatives, efficiency improvements, integration and optimization enhancements and capital project benefits to not only minimize the negative demand impacts on the short term but also to remain in position to capitalize on our longer-term strategic goals. The accomplishments were achieved while building less inventory than we had planned and staying committed to ending the quarter at our targeted weeks of supply inventory. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business. Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter was $41 million with sales of $151 million or a 27.2% margin, compared to the first quarter of 2022 EBITDA of $29 million and sales of $153 million or an 18.9% margin. Paper prices and mix were 18% higher than last year's first quarter and about 3% above for the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales volume was about 17% below last year's first quarter which included some of the inventory that had been sold from our Jackson Alabama mill and just over 4.5% below the fourth quarter of 2022. The efforts of our employees to optimize the cost structure inventory and product mix in our paper business helped minimize the inflationary cost increases compared to last year and delivered solid returns for the quarter. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter, although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect improved volume in our Packaging segment. However, prices will be lower as a result of the previously published domestic containerboard price decreases along with lower export prices. Sales volume as well as prices and mix in the Paper segment are assumed to be slightly lower based on lower demand. Although we do look for most operating costs to trend lower, our converting costs, scheduled maintenance outage expense and depreciation expense will be higher, primarily due to recent increases in contract rail rates at most of our mills, we expect higher freight and logistics expenses compared to the first quarter. Considering these items, we expect second quarter earnings of $1.96 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the annual report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. The actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call up for questions, please. Yes, George, let me start that out. I think, again, if you look at the November, December and February, price decreases, and how they've rolled in.  I think in the past 20-plus years, we only had 1 or 2 incidents of this kind of timing of price decreases. But Bob can give you some real detailed color on how that's impacting, but that's pretty much what's happening. Yes. Tom, why don't you go ahead and take a... Yes. Mark, just remember back in 2008 into the 2009 period, we saw a more rapid downturn in volume than our competitors. And then when we started seeing the improvement in the spring, we came back stronger and faster than our competitors. And I believe most of that has to do with the predominantly local book specialized local accounts, smaller local account business that we have. These accounts are much more tuned into what's happening with their own business. They can move very quickly. They're very nimble. But I'm going to let Tom elaborate on that because, again, it's not as simple as it seems. No. We just -- as we've always done, we're just going to run to demand and do what we've got to do to satisfy our customer base. If you go back and look at the first quarter, when we were in the January period of time, anticipated volume was starting to settle down and improve. We anticipated going through our winter spring annual shutdowns that would have greater need. So our plan was to build a little more inventory. As a matter of fact, I think the number was about 30,000 tons more inventory through the first quarter that we ended the year last year. But in fact, as we saw the deteriorating volume in -- especially in February and March, we certainly didn't need that extra volume. So we trimmed back and scaled back operations and only ended up 6,000 tons at the end of 1Q as opposed to where we thought it would be. So again, we'll just continue running to demand. Thank you. Next question. Yes, nothing's changed. As we've talked about for the last year, our plans were to bring capital down this year, and we're in that $400 million range. And I would anticipate that working through into next year. Also, we've done most of the big projects that we could foresee in the mills, and we're just going to continue with the box plant optimization. As far as utilization of cash in terms of other opportunities like dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions. We'll remain flexible on any and all opportunities in that regard as we go forward. As we've done for many, many years, now, we've got that flexibility to take advantage of all of these opportunities as they present themselves. And that's how we look at it day to day. Absolutely, Mark. Absolutely. That's what we would anticipate. Again, as we spoke last year that we -- our paper business now has become just the International Falls mill up in Minnesota, and that mill is capable of a little over 500,000 tons a year. And that's pretty much what we're selling too. We're down slightly off of that peak capability. But what that allows us to do really is just run and optimize the market and where we choose to sell and where we want to sell to maximize profit. So we really have the luxury of being the fourth largest player and we don't have to do anything. I say we're in a real sweet spot right now, down just a few thousand tons off of where we were last year. Any other questions, please? Thank you George. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today, and appreciate your time, and we look forward to talking with you in July and covering the second quarter earnings results. Have a nice day. Thank you."

            "name": "Robert Mundy",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. For the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $280 million and free cash flow of $168 million. Fee cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $112 million and common stock dividends of $112 million. We ended the quarter with $520 million of cash on hand, including marketable securities. I want to update you on a revision to the scheduled mill maintenance outage guidance we provided on last quarter's call. Current plans and the scope of work for the scheduled maintenance outages at our containerboard mills has changed, resulting in a revised total company estimated cost impact for the year of $0.75 per share versus the $0.67 per share we mentioned previously. The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.13 per share. And the revised estimate impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.18 per share in the second quarter, $0.24 in the third and $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. You're right, Mark. And in the magnitude, that $70, George, the timing of that, as you look at going from 1Q to 2Q, it's just -- that's unprecedented in the company's history. And we mentioned on last quarter's call that the vast majority of those price declines would show up in the second quarter. And that's exactly what's happening. So it's sort of an unprecedented drop in price just based on the timing of the published decreases is really what's driving that. And that's pretty much the answer. Yes. It was about 110,000 tons in the first quarter. Yes, John, it's Bob. As far as on the rail rate increases, most of that is -- some of it occurred during the first quarter, and then we had some that just started at the beginning of the second. So it's a large impact as you move from 1Q to 2Q because you'll have all of those pretty much higher as we start the second quarter. So that's what's driving the freight cost higher. I'm sorry, your first question was. Yes, typically. Typically, that's probably a good way to think about it. Yes, really labor benefits, obviously, with just -- that's just -- that's part of it. The other is really at starch. Starch prices are just skyrocketed and that is something that we had another big increase this year. And as we expect to -- our volume to start improving in the box plants and so forth, and you're using more of those types of things. And so that's what's driving labor and some of your some of your material costs that are also included in that converting number. No. No, it's not. Yes. Mark, this is Bob. So there's a lot going on there. If you're saying if our volumes were higher, it were closer to what we had anticipated, you're looking at that $0.95 being something a lot larger? That volume is -- it's not just box shipments, right? It's -- there's export volume, there's trade, there's domestic outside volume. So that would not be a good way to look at it. However, directionally, yes, it would be a higher number. But you would also have a lot better probably cost within your system because your mills would be running more full. Your box plants would be running more full. So you're converting costs, your direct variable costs, all those types of things, your unabsorbed costs would not be as high would more than offset any additional decline that you would see in that price variance, if that makes sense, because of higher volumes. Yes. And if you want to look at it sort of simply the published price dropped $20 a ton after we gave our guidance. And if you sort of do the math, on that. And as we said before, when that price -- the published price drops, it pretty much hits our outside containerboard immediately. There's no delay. So if you sort of do the math, there's about $0.03 just from that price decline that occurred after we gave our guidance. Yes, George. That's correct."

Your host will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Sir, please proceed when you're ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. With me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business, and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details and then I'll wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions later. Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $238 million, or $2.64 per share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2024 net income was $239 million, or $2.65 per share compared to the third quarter of 2023 net income of $185 million or $2.05 per share. Third quarter net sales were $2.2 billion in 2024 and $1.9 billion in 2023. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding special items was $461 million in 2024 and $388 million in 2023. Details of special items for both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.60 per share increase in third quarter 2024 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by higher volume of $0.94 and prices and mix $0.03 in the Packaging segment, higher volume in the Paper segment for $0.03, lower freight and logistics expenses of $0.09, lower scheduled outage expenses for $0.06 and lower interest expense for $0.05. These items were partially offset by lower prices and mix in the Paper segment for $0.02, higher operating and converting costs, $0.51, and higher depreciation expense, $0.05, and other expenses, $0.02. The results were $0.20 above our third quarter guidance of $2.45 per share, primarily due to higher volume in our Packaging and Paper segments and higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment. Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter of 2024 of $446 million with sales of $2 billion resulted in a margin of 22.2% versus last year's EBITDA of $374 million with sales of $1.8 billion and a 21.3% margin. The operational benefits of our capital spending program and the continued great focus and execution by our sales, customer service, mill and corrugated products plant employees continue to deliver impressive results. Setting new all-time quarterly records for containerboard production, total box shipments and shipments per day, while meeting the service and quality needs of our customers would not have been possible without a long-term, well thought-out strategic capital spending plan and the hard work and dedication of our employees. Even with record production, as a result of the strong demand, we were not able to meet our inventory target at the end of the quarter. With some adjustments we made to the DeRidder Mill\u2019s scheduled outage plans for this year, plus two less corrugated shipping days during the fourth quarter and with a lighter than average schedule in the first half of 2025, we do hope to reach our target by the end of the year. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and corrugated business.\nTom Hassfurther: Thanks, Mark. The corrugated products demand strengthened throughout the quarter and, as Mark mentioned, resulted in record-breaking performance for our plants. Shipments per day were up 11.1% over last year's third quarter, and total shipments with one additional shipping day were up 12.9%, versus the second quarter of 2024, shipments per day were up 5.8%, and total shipments with one less shipping day were up 4.1%. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 45,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 7,000 tons above the second quarter of 2024. Prices and mix came in ahead of expectations as implementation of our previously announced price increases for containerboard and corrugated products was managed very well. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were up $0.35 per share versus the second quarter of 2024 and flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. I'd like to mention that in addition to ensuring our customers' quality and service needs were met during a record-breaking quarter, our employees did not get complacent. Their focus on continuous improvement regarding customer service as well as efficiency, quality, productivity, and optimization improvements across our packaging segment is relentless and drives our industry-leading results. They fully understand that there are always areas that can be improved upon even with record-setting performance. Now I'll turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan : Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $43 million with sales of $159 million or a 27.0% margin compared to the third quarter of 2023, EBITDA of $35 million and sales of $158 million, or a 22.4% margin. Our previously announced price increases were implemented as planned, with average prices and mix up 2% versus the second quarter 2024 levels, and down 2% versus the third quarter of 2023. Volume, which exceeded forecast levels, had very good back to school shipments and strong printing and converting demand. Volume was up 4% versus the third quarter of 2023, and was 5% above the second quarter of 2024. No operations were managed very well with excellent machine efficiencies and material usage, especially with chemicals and energy. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for more financial details.\nBob Mundy : Thanks, Mark. Cash provided operations during the quarter totaled $327 million, with free cash flow of $180 million. And more significant cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $147 million, common stock dividends totaled $112 million, $77 million for federal and state income tax payments, and $26 million for pension and other post-employment benefit contributions. We ended the quarter with $841 million of cash, including marketable securities, and our liquidity on September 30th was approximately $1.2 billion. Lastly, our planned annual maintenance outage expense for this year has churned slightly due to the adjustments made to the DeRidder Mill outage that Mark referred to earlier. The third quarter outage impact was $0.17 per share, or $0.03 unfavorable to our previous guidance. And the new estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.20 per share, or $0.04 favorable to our guidance. The total estimate for the year is $0.87 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Thanks, Bob.\nMark Kowlzan : Thanks Bob. Looking ahead as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter, we expect demand in our Packaging segment to remain strong with corrugated shipments per day continuing to strengthen and slightly higher containerboard volume. However, total shipments for the corrugated business will be impacted by two less shipping days and the recent hurricane damage to the strawberry crops in Florida. With current containerboard inventory below our target levels, we will also attempt to build some inventory prior to yearend. We expect continued realization from the previously announced price increases and higher export prices, although with a seasonally less rich mix compared to the third quarter. In our Paper segment, shipments will be lower versus the seasonally stronger third quarter. While prices and mix should be fairly flat, operating and converting costs are expected to increase, driven by higher seasonal energy costs and chemical costs. Scheduled outage costs are estimated to be $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter, and depreciation expense should be slightly higher also. Considering these items, we expect four quarter earnings of $2.47 per share. With that, we'd be happy to answer any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward -looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. With that, Jamie, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from George Staphos from Bank of America.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the progress so far. Gentlemen, I guess the first question I had is standard. Can you talk a bit about where bookings and billings are to start the fourth quarter with whatever adjustment you want to make either per workday or actual? And if you could shade or provide some color in terms of what end markets or product lines are seeing the most or lease traction. Second question I had for you, and you talked about it last quarter. You had favorable results versus your guidance. Can you talk about how whatever growth you're getting incrementally in the brown market, so to speak, is impacting your overall mix and sort of any implications for the outlook for earnings and EBITDA growth for the future?\nTom Hassfurther: Hey, George, it's Tom. I'll take that question. First of all, on a per day basis, our bookings and billings are up just a little over 8% versus \u201823, so we continue to be in a very nice growth mode. The end markets involve a little bit about your question regarding growth and mix as well. So let me talk about the growth first. And where we're seeing some end markets that are growing more than perhaps others. And probably the biggest difference that we're seeing right now ow is that the e-comm area across the board, and of course, I've mentioned many times that we have a lot of e-commerce customers, and that a lot of our customers got into e-comm a number of years ago. That segment continues to grow nicely, and that's evidenced by anything you see out there data-wise regarding big box stores and some of this other stuff. So a lot of online shopping. And then on the other hand, some of that graphics mix which is POP related, point of purchase displays and things like that, those are pretty flat. So we've got one area growing quite nicely and another area that's been pretty flat over the last few years. And it's the same thing as we talked about in the past because of consumer spending and because of kind of where consumers are right now. The durables certainly haven't performed as well as the non-durables, at least from our segments of business that we have. So hopefully that gives you enough understanding of kind of where we are and what we're seeing.\nGeorge Staphos: Tom, that's great. I guess my last one, I'll turn it over. Can you talk a little bit about what the crop damage might mean to you in terms of volume? And as you look out to next year, do you need to ramp any investment, whether it's working capital, CapEx, to keep the growth that you'd like to have looking out to \u201825, given how tough the comparisons are. Thanks and good luck.\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, George, that's a great question. Number one is, it's a little unknown how severe the crop damage is going to be. It's a spotty all over the state of Florida and, of course, that's a very big market for us. So we anticipate that what would traditionally be a full crop that would come in during the fourth quarter is now going to come in at the end of the fourth quarter and bleeding into the first quarter of next year because they're going to have to do a lot of replanting. All those plants were quite young, so that's what caused a lot of the damage. And relative to CapEx and investments, as I've said many, many times, we invest where the customers need us to invest, and we're continuing to do that. One of the commentary I said about our employees and what a great job all of our associates have done is because we've had a lot of capital projects going on while we've had this surge in demand, and they've done just an unbelievably great job of making sure that we serviced our customers the way they need to be serviced with the quality products that they demand.\nMark Kowlzan : And keep in mind with that commentary, George, as we said on the July call, this year we will have worked on at least 60 major projects within our box plant system with new corrugators, major corrugator rebuilds, new converting lines. As we announced in July, we're heavily engaged at this point in building out the new operations in Glendale, Arizona that will start up early next year. And then just going forward, and we'll talk about this more in the January call, but we've got plans on the books to build out a couple of new big plants over the next two and a half, three years also. But we will continue the pace of reinvestment in these plants. This has been the -- it's driven the capability to be where we are today. We said this on the call, I believe, in July. If you include this year's capital spending over the last five years, we would have spent $2 billion just on the box plant system, recapitalizing and building out some new plants. And in many cases, in almost all cases, we've either quadrupled or increased even over that the capability of these box plants to produce quality packaging for the customers. And so we're not going to let up on that momentum that we have. That's what gives us the ability to grow and take care of our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Roxland from Truist.\nMike Roxland: Thanks, Mark, Tom, Bob, for taking my questions and congrats on a real good quarter. Your volumes continue to outpace the industry and your nearest peers. And how should we think about your volumes and when growth should normalize? Is that something that should occur early next year, second half of next year? Or could this even play out longer, given the ongoing telehealth infrastructure and use that your larger peers are going?\nTom Hassfurther: Mike, we plan to take advantage of every opportunity we get where we can profitably grow our revenue. And I think right now we're able to perform in a way that is very desirable for a lot of our customers certainly most of our growth comes within our existing customers and then we get opportunities outside of that as well but they happen to be looking for something we're able to deliver and I think those opportunities will remain. Now, there's no question that starting next year the comps are going to get tougher. We made a big jump this year and but we -- our key objective is profitable revenue growth and we'll continue to go down that path and I'm very confident of it especially given the fact that as I've mentioned many times our capital expenditures are not a build it and hope they will come it's we do it based on what our customers have asked us to do and that provides us a lot of opportunities and efficiencies as well.\nMark Kowlzan : Mike what Tom just said about the comps, don't forget last year's fourth quarter, I think, we were up probably 5.5% to 6% last year's fourth quarter over the prior year's fourth quarter. So the 8% he's calling up is over a very big comp. So again if you also look back over the last 20 years, PCA has a track record of significantly outgrowing our customers on the packaging side year-over-year, decade after decade and we intend on continuing that trend.\nMike Roxland: Got you, that's great color. It sounds like Mark, Tom basically just said that you could probably outgrow your peers probably at a faster rate than you had historically given some of the moving pieces that are happening in the industry.\nTom Hassfurther: Mike, I don't want to really compare ourselves to our competitors because we just basically stay focused on what our opportunities are, and we stay focused on our customers and what their demands are. And that takes us forward.\nMike Roxland: Got you. One quick follow up. Mark, you said you put out a teaser, you mentioned some new plants you're looking to build out over the next few years. You mentioned more details in January. Anything you could share with us now on those new plants, particular regions, and, Mark, is there anything you could share regarding what you're looking to accomplish with those new box plants over the next two to three years?\nMark Kowlzan : No. We'll give you more details in January.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo.\nGabe Hajde: Mark, Tom, Bob, good morning, and congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to dig in a little bit on a comment you made about a lighter maintenance outage schedule in H1 \u201825, marrying that up with, again, comments about having a little bit of difficulty seemingly, rebuild inventories, and, of course, that's a function of the performance. But it seems like in the outside world, I mean, maybe that's a little bit of marginal contribution on the production side, I don't know, 50,000 tons or something like that. Two part questions. One is, can you give us a sense for maybe the swing H1 versus H2 on the maintenance outage? And second, Mark, you guys have been really diligent about investing in the system and the business. You've talked about before being okay, being over-integrated, but you're seemingly kind of hit in red line right now in terms of your ability on the containerboard side. How long could you buy paper in the open market or maybe some thought there in terms of what the plan could be?\nMark Kowlzan : Gabe, I think you asked 10 questions in that one question. First of all, as far as the outage schedule, where are we calling it lighter for next year. Don't forget, we had that massive annual outage at Jackson to finish up the last phase of rebuild work at Jackson. That was about 40 some odd days\u2019 worth of effort. And then just the learning curve through the springtime to get the machine up where we wanted it to be. But for the 2025 year, we won't have those types of outages at any of our mills. But frankly, we're planning on just the normal routine annual outages where you take the mills down, clean inspect, routine boiler work, turbine work, machine efforts. So it ought to be a significantly lighter year in that regard without calling out a lot of details. So that\u2019s what we're implying in that. As far as the containerboard supply into the market, never underestimate us. We have long-term plans on how we will take care of our customers after the discussion that we have internally every day, so I'm confident that for the next few years we're going to be in a really great place to grow and take care of our customers' needs. That's all I want to say about that.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And then I guess maybe Bob, you did mention any sort of share repurchase, $851 million I think on the balance sheet, but just good leverage position. What opportunities do you see for the capital on a go-forward basis?\nBob Mundy : Well, Mark may be the better one to answer that, Gabe, but as you know, we always evaluate how we allocate capital, looking for the biggest return for the shareholders, what makes sense for our strategic capital spending plans and that's again and be as opportunistic as we can with our share repurchases. So, Mark, unless you have something different that's I think that's how we'll continue.\nMark Kowlzan : Yes I think if you look at our capital spend this year we called out I think the original number was $470 million dollars and then when we identified the opportunity down in the Phoenix area which specifically Glendale that number went up plus, we saw some other opportunities within some of the plants for new corrugators and some converting lines so the call out for the rest of the year I believe is up closer to $700 million right now it's $680 some odd million as we sit here but these are going into high return very, very valuable accretive opportunities within the system and we've got a runway and a portfolio of those opportunities we're going to continue to take advantage of and but frankly that's the best use of our excess cash right now. And I do believe our investors tend to agree and they do support the way we handle our cash.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. Congrats on another great quarter. So I just got maybe a little bit following up along the lines of containerboard production et cetera and opportunities to increase. Where were you in terms of operates in the third quarter? Were you pretty full out? Was Wallula running full in the third quarter?\nMark Kowlzan : Yes, all the mills were up and running. Last year, if you'll recall we brought Wallula back up and then in January, I think we finished the start-up of Wallula with the complete start-up of the mill. So essentially, we've run Wallula full out this year. And then again, don't forget, though, we had the big shutdown at Jackson. So that was a big disruption. And so, but as you could expect, we never sit still. We're always working on optimization opportunities at all of the mills. And so these will continue. But I think the good news is that we continue to run in a very effective, very efficient manner of taking advantage of our assets, and then planning out into the future years where tons, where, I should say, containerboard will come from to supply the customer's needs on the corrugated side. And I'm very confident. We've got a good plan for the next few years.\nMark Weintraub: Understood. And are there potentially significant internal Jackson type opportunities? Or is it more, at least internally, going to be smaller projects across the board, perhaps?\nMark Kowlzan : It's a combination. We've got a few projects identified right now, quite frankly. We've got some paper machines in the system that time goes by pretty quickly. Counce Mill received the lion's share of capital spending in the 1990s and the early 2000s. That's 25 years ago. And so we've got opportunities to look at Counce number one machine as an example and really do some things to that machine to get some good incremental capability out of that. Valdosta is another example of a machine that has incremental opportunity. And then, depending on how much capital you want to spend in the future years, in terms of adding another paper machine, if we had to in the future years. But right now, for the next few years, we're in a very good place on how we take care of the customers. It would be a containerboard supply.\nMark Weintraub: And just because it deserves a little attention, the Paper segment did phenomenally in the quarter, the EBITDA margins. I guess it's now just I Falls, and that's always been a great facility for you. How much of it is it that everything that's now going through I Falls versus what else might have been going on that you basically, at least based on my numbers, were as strong as you've ever been margin wise in the Paper segment?\nMark Kowlzan : Yes, I believe we had one quarter a couple of years ago that was at the same 27% level. But no, we have I Falls, it's the one mill, it's producing close to the 500,000 tons a year of uncoated freesheet production. That's a blend of the converting grades, and probably 75% of that is cut size for a copy machine type paper. But that mill is hitting on all eight cylinders, and it's been a great place, and well capitalized, and great management, great employees. So we rationalized that paper business as we were converting the Boise assets. And we're in a good place with the market, and we'll just continue to take advantage of that.\nMark Weintraub: Super, I appreciate it. One last real, quick one. I think you mentioned $0.87 for maintenance outage this year. If I heard you right, you're saying that might be lower next year. What would normal be for annual maintenance outages?\nBob Mundy : Yes, Mark, it\u2019s normal, I don't know, this year obviously with Jackson included in that, it was higher than normal, but yes, we anticipate, and Mark sort of touched on it earlier with just incremental volume next year if you just look at it from a change in our outage schedule this year to next year, right now at a high level, there's probably close to 100,000 tons of additional production next year. So, using that as sort of a way to get at, what's normal would take that off of the $0.87 and that's probably the good ballpark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jeffries.\nPhilip Ng: Hey, guys. Congrats on another strong quarter. You're certainly lapping tougher year-over-year comps, but operating costs stepped up noticeably. Any color, Bob, I guess perhaps what you're seeing where it's a little bit more elevated and are you starting to see that level off? And then I think you guys called out how Jackson and maybe some of the inefficiencies and shutdowns. Was it dragged this year when we kind of look at the 2025, could this flippin be a good guy?\nBob Mundy : Well, I think your first question, Phil, to answer that, we said on the last quarter's call, and it played out that way, that sequentially costs, we didn't see a lot of increase, obviously sort of somewhat stable, slightly higher, but obviously at a very high level with all of the inflation that's been going on for several quarters. If you look, if you're referring to year-over-year, you have to keep in mind that third quarter of last year, we did not run Wallula, and we did this year. So this year we brought in our highest cost direct variable mill along with a lot of in-directs and things that you don't incur when you're shutdown, you bring that on, and there's probably close to $30 million of cost just for that alone, third quarter this year versus last.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. And when you think about 2025 with all that kind of level set, and as you kind of pointed out, you're starting to see that level off, could that operating cost be a good guy next year?\nBob Mundy : I mean, we'll have to see. Obviously, keep in mind, the first quarter was always, you'll see a big jump because, as we talk about every year with sort of the reload of a lot of the fringes and benefits on the salary side of things, you have increases that go into effect in that first quarter, so you'll expect a jump for that reason alone, fourth to first. But right now, obviously, we don't get too far ahead of ourselves regarding guidance, but hopefully, if we don't see a lot of costs going down, but hopefully, yes, they have moderated for a while for the next few quarters, and that would bode well for us next year.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. And just some of the big inputs, as you see, could come down a little bit, energy's been a little more favorable. Anything else to call out in terms of costs that you're seeing, good or bad, trend -wise?\nBob Mundy : No, as I said, other than the two you mentioned, things are seemed to be fairly somewhat stable right now, Phil.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. That's great. And when we think about your three key price mix, as you kind of pointed out, was better than we expected, and I think a little better than you anticipated as well. Was that more mix, or is that more box price realization coming through perhaps a little quicker than you expected? In the fourth quarter, per your guidance, you pretty much have all the box price increases fully implemented by now?\nTom Hassfurther: Phil, this is Tom. Relative to the box price increase, I'm going to remind everybody here because there was some discussion about this earlier, we have a very disciplined approach to our box price increase, and we do it by customer, by item, and we track every single one of them and make sure that they get implemented properly. And the timing of that hasn't changed. It's the same timing we've always gone through. We will have the lion's share of it through the third quarter. We will have some tracking into the fourth quarter and actually a couple of contracts that trigger annually. so we'll have it pretty much implemented certainly by the end of the fourth quarter and it's, that that certainly has had an impact and I think our mix, if we've done a very, very good job of as this mix has changed a little bit figuring out how to produce that very effectively and efficiently and that's helped us as well.\nPhilip Ng: And, Tom, these are annual contract triggering that trigger in 3Q or that triggers in the fourth quarter? Trying to make sure I understand that comment.\nTom Hassfurther: The couple annual ones are on a calendar year so trigger at January \u201925.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning. Tom, you talked about growth and maybe some business wins in e-commerce and I am curious historically PCA has been really virgin weighted but you have the ability to swing into recycled. Is this new business like a bit more recycled based than your existing business and as you think about adding maybe some incremental tons or debottlenecking over the next few years, did you think about the kind of virgin versus recycled mix maybe differently than you would have 5 -10 years ago or just kind of wondered if you can comment on that and maybe just that industry trend in the US, whether that the kind of mix in the lightweight recycled has really taken hold or maybe is overhyped or how your position there?\nTom Hassfurther: Anthony, we really -- we look at whatever the performances that any customer needs and we have done as we talked about in the past. We've done some significant things in the mills to put us in a much better position to be able to run even lightweights and things like that and that's been important to us. Now, we don't take that directly to any particular market or anything like that. We just are able to now react very well to whatever the customer needs and whatever their demands are and we're able to do it on a performance basis that is most important and that really has always set us apart from the recycled industry, the 100% recycled boards and I think gives us somewhat of a competitive advantage. But again, it\u2019s not -- we're not purposeful about taking a particular grade or anything like that to the market. We actually work the other way and do whatever the customer needs and meet those needs.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's helpful, and that makes a lot of sense. On inventories, you talked about, you plan to build inventory in 3Q ahead of the October DeRidder outage, but you talked about inventories kind of still below target levels. I just want to make sure I understand, like, is that really driven just by stronger than expected demand? Were there any other operational issues, technical issues that led to that kind of shortfall relative to maybe earlier expectations on inventories?\nMark Kowlzan : Yes, I mean, it was driven by demand. We did not expect to see the kind of growth this year that we have experienced, and we've been talking about building inventory all year, and we've not yet succeeded in coming anywhere near close to where we should be. And so, in some ways, though, it's not a bad place to be. With the lower inventories, it keeps everybody on their toes, and it's not a bad place to be. Everybody knows how critical every minute of machine production is to the system, so everybody's fully engaged.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Charlie Muir-Sands from BNP Paribas.\nCharlie Sands: Hi, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question, so I've just got one remaining, actually. You touched a little bit on it earlier, but just in terms of the strength of volumes sequentially and particularly quarter-on-quarter, could you share any insight as to whether that is in particular coming from existing clients, existing business, or existing clients, new business, or indeed new clients? I appreciate it. We haven't obviously got the industry data yet. All your peers haven't reported either. I just want to get some color around where that incremental growth is coming from, do you think?\nTom Hassfurther: Charlie, I will tell you that number one is it comes from our existing customers and growing within our existing customers. That's our primary target, but we have been fortunate enough to add other clients as well. And that's played very important because I think that our reputation, we have in the marketplace is such that customers really do recognize the value you bring when you produce a quality product and you actually deliver it when you say you're going to be there.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Ryan Fox from Bloomberg.\nRyan Fox: Good morning, guys. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit more about the higher operating costings and converting costs? I think you had mentioned the majority of that may have come from Wallula, but that may have only attributed to maybe two-thirds of that. Just curious to see what else was hanging out there?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, Ryan, obviously the other pretty much is higher OCC costs versus last year. That's the large number. And then labor and benefits. That would be another component. And those things that don't get talked about a lot that are part of building rentals, professional fees, all that outside service costs, they incur higher costs as well and they pass those on to us on a lot of fronts. Insurance, taxes, a lot of those types of things or that would be the other component.\nRyan Fox: Got it. And I guess lastly, seems like a record quarter for containerboard production, almost 1.3 million tons. How much more do you have available per quarter, kind of theoretically?\nMark Kowlzan : We won't get into that. Just suffice it to say that we've got plenty of capability to take care of our customers for the next few years.\nOperator: And we do have a follow-up question from George Staphos from Bank of America.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, guys. A quick one. Thanks for letting me sneak into the extent that you can comment. If we think about the next two years and you had a stack rank where you do expect to be able to get the paper to serve the growth and we think about three or four categories existing optimization and productivity across your mills, like you said, with Counce and Valdosta conversions or outside purchases, how would you stack rank those in terms of how you'll supply the paper? Thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.\nMark Kowlzan : For the next year, it will be just optimizing what we currently have. And then over the next few years, it's doing some bigger projects within our system. And so again, we've got a good runway for the next few years that we've already thought out here.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you, Mark.\nMark Kowlzan : Okay. With that, I believe, if there are any more questions, we've got time. But, Jamie, if there's anybody else out there?\nOperator: Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions at this time. Do you have closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan : Thank you for joining us today. I really appreciate everybody's time and look forward to talking with you at the end of January when we review the full year 2024 and the fourth quarter. Have a good rest of the day and a great holiday season. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. The corrugated products demand strengthened throughout the quarter and, as Mark mentioned, resulted in record-breaking performance for our plants. Shipments per day were up 11.1% over last year's third quarter, and total shipments with one additional shipping day were up 12.9%, versus the second quarter of 2024, shipments per day were up 5.8%, and total shipments with one less shipping day were up 4.1%. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 45,000 tons above last year's third quarter and 7,000 tons above the second quarter of 2024. Prices and mix came in ahead of expectations as implementation of our previously announced price increases for containerboard and corrugated products was managed very well. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were up $0.35 per share versus the second quarter of 2024 and flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. I'd like to mention that in addition to ensuring our customers' quality and service needs were met during a record-breaking quarter, our employees did not get complacent. Their focus on continuous improvement regarding customer service as well as efficiency, quality, productivity, and optimization improvements across our packaging segment is relentless and drives our industry-leading results. They fully understand that there are always areas that can be improved upon even with record-setting performance. Now I'll turn it back to Mark. Hey, George, it's Tom. I'll take that question. First of all, on a per day basis, our bookings and billings are up just a little over 8% versus \u201823, so we continue to be in a very nice growth mode. The end markets involve a little bit about your question regarding growth and mix as well. So let me talk about the growth first. And where we're seeing some end markets that are growing more than perhaps others. And probably the biggest difference that we're seeing right now ow is that the e-comm area across the board, and of course, I've mentioned many times that we have a lot of e-commerce customers, and that a lot of our customers got into e-comm a number of years ago. That segment continues to grow nicely, and that's evidenced by anything you see out there data-wise regarding big box stores and some of this other stuff. So a lot of online shopping. And then on the other hand, some of that graphics mix which is POP related, point of purchase displays and things like that, those are pretty flat. So we've got one area growing quite nicely and another area that's been pretty flat over the last few years. And it's the same thing as we talked about in the past because of consumer spending and because of kind of where consumers are right now. The durables certainly haven't performed as well as the non-durables, at least from our segments of business that we have. So hopefully that gives you enough understanding of kind of where we are and what we're seeing. Yes, George, that's a great question. Number one is, it's a little unknown how severe the crop damage is going to be. It's a spotty all over the state of Florida and, of course, that's a very big market for us. So we anticipate that what would traditionally be a full crop that would come in during the fourth quarter is now going to come in at the end of the fourth quarter and bleeding into the first quarter of next year because they're going to have to do a lot of replanting. All those plants were quite young, so that's what caused a lot of the damage. And relative to CapEx and investments, as I've said many, many times, we invest where the customers need us to invest, and we're continuing to do that. One of the commentary I said about our employees and what a great job all of our associates have done is because we've had a lot of capital projects going on while we've had this surge in demand, and they've done just an unbelievably great job of making sure that we serviced our customers the way they need to be serviced with the quality products that they demand. Mike, we plan to take advantage of every opportunity we get where we can profitably grow our revenue. And I think right now we're able to perform in a way that is very desirable for a lot of our customers certainly most of our growth comes within our existing customers and then we get opportunities outside of that as well but they happen to be looking for something we're able to deliver and I think those opportunities will remain. Now, there's no question that starting next year the comps are going to get tougher. We made a big jump this year and but we -- our key objective is profitable revenue growth and we'll continue to go down that path and I'm very confident of it especially given the fact that as I've mentioned many times our capital expenditures are not a build it and hope they will come it's we do it based on what our customers have asked us to do and that provides us a lot of opportunities and efficiencies as well. Mike, I don't want to really compare ourselves to our competitors because we just basically stay focused on what our opportunities are, and we stay focused on our customers and what their demands are. And that takes us forward. Phil, this is Tom. Relative to the box price increase, I'm going to remind everybody here because there was some discussion about this earlier, we have a very disciplined approach to our box price increase, and we do it by customer, by item, and we track every single one of them and make sure that they get implemented properly. And the timing of that hasn't changed. It's the same timing we've always gone through. We will have the lion's share of it through the third quarter. We will have some tracking into the fourth quarter and actually a couple of contracts that trigger annually. so we'll have it pretty much implemented certainly by the end of the fourth quarter and it's, that that certainly has had an impact and I think our mix, if we've done a very, very good job of as this mix has changed a little bit figuring out how to produce that very effectively and efficiently and that's helped us as well. The couple annual ones are on a calendar year so trigger at January '25. Anthony, we really -- we look at whatever the performances that any customer needs and we have done as we talked about in the past. We've done some significant things in the mills to put us in a much better position to be able to run even lightweights and things like that and that's been important to us. Now, we don't take that directly to any particular market or anything like that. We just are able to now react very well to whatever the customer needs and whatever their demands are and we're able to do it on a performance basis that is most important and that really has always set us apart from the recycled industry, the 100% recycled boards and I think gives us somewhat of a competitive advantage. But again, it's not -- we're not purposeful about taking a particular grade or anything like that to the market. We actually work the other way and do whatever the customer needs and meet those needs. Charlie, I will tell you that number one is it comes from our existing customers and growing within our existing customers. That's our primary target, but we have been fortunate enough to add other clients as well. And that's played very important because I think that our reputation, we have in the marketplace is such that customers really do recognize the value you bring when you produce a quality product and you actually deliver it when you say you're going to be there. Yes, Ryan, obviously the other pretty much is higher OCC costs versus last year. That's the large number. And then labor and benefits. That would be another component. And those things that don't get talked about a lot that are part of building rentals, professional fees, all that outside service costs, they incur higher costs as well and they pass those on to us on a lot of fronts. Insurance, taxes, a lot of those types of things or that would be the other component."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's third quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. With me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business, and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, I'll begin the call with an overview of the third quarter results, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details and then I'll wrap things up and then we'd be glad to take questions later. Yesterday, we reported third quarter net income of $238 million, or $2.64 per share. Excluding special items, third quarter 2024 net income was $239 million, or $2.65 per share compared to the third quarter of 2023 net income of $185 million or $2.05 per share. Third quarter net sales were $2.2 billion in 2024 and $1.9 billion in 2023. Total company EBITDA for the third quarter excluding special items was $461 million in 2024 and $388 million in 2023. Details of special items for both the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.60 per share increase in third quarter 2024 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by higher volume of $0.94 and prices and mix $0.03 in the Packaging segment, higher volume in the Paper segment for $0.03, lower freight and logistics expenses of $0.09, lower scheduled outage expenses for $0.06 and lower interest expense for $0.05. These items were partially offset by lower prices and mix in the Paper segment for $0.02, higher operating and converting costs, $0.51, and higher depreciation expense, $0.05, and other expenses, $0.02. The results were $0.20 above our third quarter guidance of $2.45 per share, primarily due to higher volume in our Packaging and Paper segments and higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment. Looking at our Packaging business, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter of 2024 of $446 million with sales of $2 billion resulted in a margin of 22.2% versus last year's EBITDA of $374 million with sales of $1.8 billion and a 21.3% margin. The operational benefits of our capital spending program and the continued great focus and execution by our sales, customer service, mill and corrugated products plant employees continue to deliver impressive results. Setting new all-time quarterly records for containerboard production, total box shipments and shipments per day, while meeting the service and quality needs of our customers would not have been possible without a long-term, well thought-out strategic capital spending plan and the hard work and dedication of our employees. Even with record production, as a result of the strong demand, we were not able to meet our inventory target at the end of the quarter. With some adjustments we made to the DeRidder Mill's scheduled outage plans for this year, plus two less corrugated shipping days during the fourth quarter and with a lighter than average schedule in the first half of 2025, we do hope to reach our target by the end of the year. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and corrugated business. Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the third quarter was $43 million with sales of $159 million or a 27.0% margin compared to the third quarter of 2023, EBITDA of $35 million and sales of $158 million, or a 22.4% margin. Our previously announced price increases were implemented as planned, with average prices and mix up 2% versus the second quarter 2024 levels, and down 2% versus the third quarter of 2023. Volume, which exceeded forecast levels, had very good back to school shipments and strong printing and converting demand. Volume was up 4% versus the third quarter of 2023, and was 5% above the second quarter of 2024. No operations were managed very well with excellent machine efficiencies and material usage, especially with chemicals and energy. And now I'll turn it over to Bob for more financial details. Thanks Bob. Looking ahead as we move from the third and into the fourth quarter, we expect demand in our Packaging segment to remain strong with corrugated shipments per day continuing to strengthen and slightly higher containerboard volume. However, total shipments for the corrugated business will be impacted by two less shipping days and the recent hurricane damage to the strawberry crops in Florida. With current containerboard inventory below our target levels, we will also attempt to build some inventory prior to yearend. We expect continued realization from the previously announced price increases and higher export prices, although with a seasonally less rich mix compared to the third quarter. In our Paper segment, shipments will be lower versus the seasonally stronger third quarter. While prices and mix should be fairly flat, operating and converting costs are expected to increase, driven by higher seasonal energy costs and chemical costs. Scheduled outage costs are estimated to be $0.12 per share higher than the third quarter, and depreciation expense should be slightly higher also. Considering these items, we expect four quarter earnings of $2.47 per share. With that, we'd be happy to answer any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward -looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company, and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. With that, Jamie, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please. And keep in mind with that commentary, George, as we said on the July call, this year we will have worked on at least 60 major projects within our box plant system with new corrugators, major corrugator rebuilds, new converting lines. As we announced in July, we're heavily engaged at this point in building out the new operations in Glendale, Arizona that will start up early next year. And then just going forward, and we'll talk about this more in the January call, but we've got plans on the books to build out a couple of new big plants over the next two and a half, three years also. But we will continue the pace of reinvestment in these plants. This has been the -- it's driven the capability to be where we are today. We said this on the call, I believe, in July. If you include this year's capital spending over the last five years, we would have spent $2 billion just on the box plant system, recapitalizing and building out some new plants. And in many cases, in almost all cases, we've either quadrupled or increased even over that the capability of these box plants to produce quality packaging for the customers. And so we're not going to let up on that momentum that we have. That's what gives us the ability to grow and take care of our customers. Mike what Tom just said about the comps, don't forget last year's fourth quarter, I think, we were up probably 5.5% to 6% last year's fourth quarter over the prior year's fourth quarter. So the 8% he's calling up is over a very big comp. So again if you also look back over the last 20 years, PCA has a track record of significantly outgrowing our customers on the packaging side year-over-year, decade after decade and we intend on continuing that trend. No. We'll give you more details in January. Gabe, I think you asked 10 questions in that one question. First of all, as far as the outage schedule, where are we calling it lighter for next year. Don't forget, we had that massive annual outage at Jackson to finish up the last phase of rebuild work at Jackson. That was about 40 some odd days' worth of effort. And then just the learning curve through the springtime to get the machine up where we wanted it to be. But for the 2025 year, we won't have those types of outages at any of our mills. But frankly, we're planning on just the normal routine annual outages where you take the mills down, clean inspect, routine boiler work, turbine work, machine efforts. So it ought to be a significantly lighter year in that regard without calling out a lot of details. So that's what we're implying in that. As far as the containerboard supply into the market, never underestimate us. We have long-term plans on how we will take care of our customers after the discussion that we have internally every day, so I'm confident that for the next few years we're going to be in a really great place to grow and take care of our customers' needs. That's all I want to say about that. Yes I think if you look at our capital spend this year we called out I think the original number was $470 million dollars and then when we identified the opportunity down in the Phoenix area which specifically Glendale that number went up plus, we saw some other opportunities within some of the plants for new corrugators and some converting lines so the call out for the rest of the year I believe is up closer to $700 million right now it's $680 some odd million as we sit here but these are going into high return very, very valuable accretive opportunities within the system and we've got a runway and a portfolio of those opportunities we're going to continue to take advantage of and but frankly that's the best use of our excess cash right now. And I do believe our investors tend to agree and they do support the way we handle our cash. Yes, all the mills were up and running. Last year, if you'll recall we brought Wallula back up and then in January, I think we finished the start-up of Wallula with the complete start-up of the mill. So essentially, we've run Wallula full out this year. And then again, don't forget, though, we had the big shutdown at Jackson. So that was a big disruption. And so, but as you could expect, we never sit still. We're always working on optimization opportunities at all of the mills. And so these will continue. But I think the good news is that we continue to run in a very effective, very efficient manner of taking advantage of our assets, and then planning out into the future years where tons, where, I should say, containerboard will come from to supply the customer's needs on the corrugated side. And I'm very confident. We've got a good plan for the next few years. It's a combination. We've got a few projects identified right now, quite frankly. We've got some paper machines in the system that time goes by pretty quickly. Counce Mill received the lion's share of capital spending in the 1990s and the early 2000s. That's 25 years ago. And so we've got opportunities to look at Counce number one machine as an example and really do some things to that machine to get some good incremental capability out of that. Valdosta is another example of a machine that has incremental opportunity. And then, depending on how much capital you want to spend in the future years, in terms of adding another paper machine, if we had to in the future years. But right now, for the next few years, we're in a very good place on how we take care of the customers. It would be a containerboard supply. Yes, I believe we had one quarter a couple of years ago that was at the same 27% level. But no, we have I Falls, it's the one mill, it's producing close to the 500,000 tons a year of uncoated freesheet production. That's a blend of the converting grades, and probably 75% of that is cut size for a copy machine type paper. But that mill is hitting on all eight cylinders, and it's been a great place, and well capitalized, and great management, great employees. So we rationalized that paper business as we were converting the Boise assets. And we're in a good place with the market, and we'll just continue to take advantage of that. Yes, I mean, it was driven by demand. We did not expect to see the kind of growth this year that we have experienced, and we've been talking about building inventory all year, and we've not yet succeeded in coming anywhere near close to where we should be. And so, in some ways, though, it's not a bad place to be. With the lower inventories, it keeps everybody on their toes, and it's not a bad place to be. Everybody knows how critical every minute of machine production is to the system, so everybody's fully engaged. We won't get into that. Just suffice it to say that we've got plenty of capability to take care of our customers for the next few years. For the next year, it will be just optimizing what we currently have. And then over the next few years, it's doing some bigger projects within our system. And so again, we've got a good runway for the next few years that we've already thought out here. Okay. With that, I believe, if there are any more questions, we've got time. But, Jamie, if there's anybody else out there? Thank you for joining us today. I really appreciate everybody's time and look forward to talking with you at the end of January when we review the full year 2024 and the fourth quarter. Have a good rest of the day and a great holiday season. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Cash provided operations during the quarter totaled $327 million, with free cash flow of $180 million. And more significant cash payments during the quarter included capital expenditures of $147 million, common stock dividends totaled $112 million, $77 million for federal and state income tax payments, and $26 million for pension and other post-employment benefit contributions. We ended the quarter with $841 million of cash, including marketable securities, and our liquidity on September 30th was approximately $1.2 billion. Lastly, our planned annual maintenance outage expense for this year has churned slightly due to the adjustments made to the DeRidder Mill outage that Mark referred to earlier. The third quarter outage impact was $0.17 per share, or $0.03 unfavorable to our previous guidance. And the new estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.20 per share, or $0.04 favorable to our guidance. The total estimate for the year is $0.87 per share. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Thanks, Bob. Well, Mark may be the better one to answer that, Gabe, but as you know, we always evaluate how we allocate capital, looking for the biggest return for the shareholders, what makes sense for our strategic capital spending plans and that's again and be as opportunistic as we can with our share repurchases. So, Mark, unless you have something different that's I think that's how we'll continue. Yes, Mark, it's normal, I don't know, this year obviously with Jackson included in that, it was higher than normal, but yes, we anticipate, and Mark sort of touched on it earlier with just incremental volume next year if you just look at it from a change in our outage schedule this year to next year, right now at a high level, there's probably close to 100,000 tons of additional production next year. So, using that as sort of a way to get at, what's normal would take that off of the $0.87 and that's probably the good ballpark. Well, I think your first question, Phil, to answer that, we said on the last quarter's call, and it played out that way, that sequentially costs, we didn't see a lot of increase, obviously sort of somewhat stable, slightly higher, but obviously at a very high level with all of the inflation that's been going on for several quarters. If you look, if you're referring to year-over-year, you have to keep in mind that third quarter of last year, we did not run Wallula, and we did this year. So this year we brought in our highest cost direct variable mill along with a lot of in-directs and things that you don't incur when you're shutdown, you bring that on, and there's probably close to $30 million of cost just for that alone, third quarter this year versus last. I mean, we'll have to see. Obviously, keep in mind, the first quarter was always, you'll see a big jump because, as we talk about every year with sort of the reload of a lot of the fringes and benefits on the salary side of things, you have increases that go into effect in that first quarter, so you'll expect a jump for that reason alone, fourth to first. But right now, obviously, we don't get too far ahead of ourselves regarding guidance, but hopefully, if we don't see a lot of costs going down, but hopefully, yes, they have moderated for a while for the next few quarters, and that would bode well for us next year. No, as I said, other than the two you mentioned, things are seemed to be fairly somewhat stable right now, Phil."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of the second quarter results. And then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up and we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $199 million or $2.21 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2024 net income was $199 million or $2.20 per share compared to the second quarter 2023 net income of $209 million or $2.31 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2024 and $2 billion in 2023. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter excluding special items, was $404 million in 2024 and $418 million in 2023. The details of special items for both the second quarter of '24 and 2023 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.11 per share decrease in second quarter 2024 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment for $0.87 and Paper segment $0.07. Even with our constant focus on minimizing inflationary cost increases, operating costs were higher by $0.31 per share. This was particularly in the areas of recycled fiber and inflation-driven increases on labor and benefits, outside service expenses, repair and operating material costs, rents, property taxes and insurance. We also had higher depreciation expense of $0.03 and a higher tax rate of $0.03. These items were partially offset by higher volume in the Packaging segment for $0.94 and Paper segment $0.07, lower other converting costs, $0.07, lower freight and logistics expenses, $0.06 and lower interest expense, $0.06. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2024 of $400 million with sales of $1.9 billion resulted in a margin of 21% versus last year's EBITDA of $405 million and sales of $1.8 billion or a 23% margin. The strong market conditions in our Packaging segment continued in the second quarter. This drove a new all-time containerboard production record that was necessary in order to service the corrugated products and containerboard demand. Also, Packaging segment prices and mix moved higher from the first quarter levels as we continue to implement our announced price increases. Although still below target levels, we were able to build some inventory ahead of what we expect to be a very busy second half of the year. In our mills and corrugated products facilities, employees remain focused on efficient and cost-effective operations from thousands of initiatives as well as implementing the benefits and improvements from our capital spending strategy. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business in general.\nTom Hassfurther: Thanks, Mark. Along with the record-setting containerboard production that Mark mentioned, corrugated products demand strengthened throughout the quarter and ended with a new shipments per day record for the month of June. In fact, we were just 0.1% away from our all-time second quarter total shipments record. Shipments per day were up 9.2% over last year's second quarter and total shipments with 1 additional shipping day were up 10.9%. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 42,000 tons above last year's second quarter and 35,000 tons above the first quarter of 2024. Segment prices and mix moved higher as we continue to implement our price increases from February which was negatively impacted by the late fourth quarter 2023 decrease reported by the RISI publication along with the more recent increase in June. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were up $0.09 per share compared to the first quarter of 2024. However, they were $0.84 per share below the second quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were up $0.03 per share versus the first quarter and down $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2023. Finally, some of you may have seen news about an investment we made in the Phoenix, Arizona area. In order to serve a growing market and to grow with our existing customers, we are in the process of replacing our current Phoenix corrugated products plant with a modern state-of-the-art facility. Like many of our strategic projects, the Phoenix project improves the capacity, technology and equipment in the plant gets us aligned properly in the right marketplaces addresses the needs of our customers so that we both grow profitably and improves the efficiencies and cost within our system. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $31 million with sales of $150 million or a 20.4% margin compared to the second quarter of 2023 EBITDA of $39 million and sales of $143 million or a 27.2% margin. Paper segment prices and mix as well as volume came in as expected. And as we mentioned last quarter, although we are implementing our recently announced paper price increases, the published decrease in index prices earlier this year and how that impacts contract triggers with certain customers would initially delay the timing of realizing the increases. Overall, average prices and mix were essentially flat with the first quarter 2024 levels and down 5.6% versus the second quarter of 2023. Market conditions versus last year were solid with volume up 12% versus the second quarter of 2023 driven somewhat by the timing of seasonal back-to-school business. Volume was 8% below the first quarter of 2024, impacted by the scheduled maintenance outage at the International Falls, Minnesota mill as well as exceptionally strong volume in the first quarter. Similar to the comments I made regarding the packaging business, employees in the Paper business remain focused on very efficient and cost-effective operations and executed the outage International Falls very well and slightly below our cost estimates. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $278 million and free cash flow was $33 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $245 million, dividend payments of $112 million, cash taxes of $100 million and interest payments of $37 million. Excluding the invested cash proceeds from the bond transaction we'll use to retire the $400 million bond that matures in September. Our quarter end cash balance, including marketable securities was approximately $800 million with liquidity of $1.1 billion. We mentioned on last quarter's call that today we would provide an update on our capital spending guidance. We are revising our full year guidance from a range of $470 million to $490 million to a range of $670 million to $690 million. The increase is primarily attributable to additional high-return, profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities within our box plants as well as the new greenfield box plant in Phoenix that Tom spoke of. Spending for these projects fits in very well with our expected cash flow and balanced approach towards cash allocation in order to grow profitably our company and maximize returns to our shareholders. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second quarter into the third quarter, prices and mix in both our Packaging and Paper segments will move higher as we continue to implement previously announced increases along with higher containerboard export prices. Although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect shipments per day to continue to strengthen, potentially setting a new third quarter record. We also expect higher containerboard volume. With current containerboard inventory below our target levels, we will also attempt to build some inventory ahead of the scheduled maintenance outage at our DeRidder Mill in October. Paper volume will be slightly lower primarily due to timing of back-to-school business that was received in the second quarter. Operating and converting costs should be higher primarily due to seasonal electricity usage and prices and slightly higher recycled fiber costs with scheduled outage expense expected to be slightly lower. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.45 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Alan, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America Securities.\nGeorge Staphos: I guess the first question I had gentlemen, is on costs. So you highlighted the $0.31 year-on-year negative variance in operating costs, converting costs were a little bit lower by $0.07. So the net of that was still a negative $0.24. If I look at the first quarter year-on-year, you were still seeing positives, I think kind of netting those 2 that you showed last quarter was $0.15. So almost like a $0.40 swing in 1 quarter in terms of comparisons, along with OCC -- gentlemen, what was the biggest factor in terms of costs that you've been trying to manage around? And what's the outlook? You said higher operating costs into the third quarter. There's a way to size what's happening in the third quarter on those factors. And then, I had a couple of follow-ons.\nBob Mundy: Yes, George, this is Bob. I think what you're seeing is year-over-year in the second quarter, we ran Wallula full in the second quarter, whereas last year, they ran only 1 month of the quarter. And of course, as you know, Wallula is our highest cost mills. So it was a big mill mix impact that affected cost plus, I think, the year-over-year on energy and like you said, OCC, that was higher in the second quarter than it was in the first. And I think that will pretty much close that gap when you look at it that way. And then going from the second to the third, I think you'll see, your other question. We didn't mention a lot in the guidance relative to cost because it should be fairly stable, up slightly, like we said for OCC and more electrical usage in rates. But other than that, it should be fairly -- maybe chemical is up a little bit but not as much sequential movement as we've seen in the past.\nGeorge Staphos: Just holding at a very, very high level.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes.\nBob Mundy: Yes. Yes, exactly.\nGeorge Staphos: Understood. Secondly, jumping around a bit. Can you talk a little bit about bookings and billings as you normally do early in the quarter? And how -- kind of what the exit rate was or the momentum out of 2Q?\nTom Hassfurther: George, this is Tom. Yes, bookings remain very robust. Bookings and billings both remain very robust. Through 12 days, we're up 12.5% so far in July. So an incredibly good start to the quarter. We had a very good start to last quarter. We exited at a higher rate and we're continuing that higher rate as you see going into the third quarter.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. My last one and I'll turn it over and related to sort of the volume outlook. Can you talk at all as to how your mix of business may have changed, if at all, now versus a year or 2 years ago. And frankly, the question that is behind the question, PKG's always seemingly done better than the industry over the years but the gap is quite stark when you look at it relative to still the macro data that's out there. So what do you attribute what's been very, very strong growth for PKG relative to a very mixed outlook where we look around the rest of consumer packaging? And how is mix changing. And can you talk a little bit about external sales which look like they're up? Is that a factor here in terms of what's happening with your revenue base?\nTom Hassfurther: Thanks, George. Now I'll address what I can, okay? And to give you as much color as I possibly can. What's happening with our mix is, is that the growth the growth we see within our existing accounts and some of the new business that we brought on is primarily in the brown area. And if you look at what's happening overall as we see it in the marketplace, some of that specialty business which would be graphics-oriented and some of those sorts of things have remained relatively stable, whereas the other growth has been primarily in brown. So from a mix standpoint, it's a slight change. It's not this big dramatic change or anything like that. But this is -- our growth is a result of a team working incredibly well, performing at a very high level, remaining incredibly focused on the customer and aligning ourselves with the markets and the customers that we choose to do business with.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Roxland of Truist.\nMike Roxland: Congrats on another good quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of your 2Q guidance during 1Q, you mentioned your guidance to $2.07, you rounded up at $2.20. Wondering what occurred during the quarter relative to your expectations that drove the beat?\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, Mike, volume was the big factor. Obviously, operational efficiencies but the big volume boost was the positive there.\nMike Roxland: Got it. Okay. So really a volume but also some of the cost efficiencies that you continue to pursue because now that you mentioned [indiscernible] markets for thousands of opportunities. A combination of those 2 really drove you at $0.13 fee relative to your initial expectations?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Exactly.\nMike Roxland: Got it. And then just quickly, I would love to get your thoughts around your competition which seems to be changing. And a lot of them that seem to be echoing the strategy that you've pursued for some time in terms of targeting smaller local talents, trying to get more value over volume. Do you have any concerns in terms of this companies pursuing a similar strategy? Do you think of making competition. But what do you think is that -- what is sort of happening? And what are you doing to prepare if they become more aggressive and try to compete in your backyard.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Personally, I don't have any concerns about that. People have talked about that for a number of years. But again, Tom, why don't you weigh in on that also?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, Mike, I would just say, listen, I mean, we don't really comment on our competition or what our competition is doing. We have our strategy, we go execute our strategy in the marketplace. And that is, as I've mentioned before, aligning with the right customers in the right segments. That's what we try to do. And what our competition is working on or is doing at the moment is really their plan, their program. And so I've got very little to comment on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Weintraub of Seaport Research Partners.\nMark Weintraub: So you mentioned Wallula negative mill mix impact. You're also though ramping up Jackson and or have ramped it up. And can you kind of give us a sense as to how much of a positive impact that has perhaps already had? And is there more that's likely to show up? And when would you expect it to be really operating at its highest levels of productivity, efficiency, cost position?\nMark Kowlzan: Jackson is delivering exactly what we needed to do. When we talked about this project 2 years ago, we said it was a 2,000 ton a day project, quite frankly, we've exceeded that. We've proven that the machine can run up with 2,400 tons a day which would be 800,000 ton a year run rate. Currently, for the last couple of months, we've been running in the 1,900 ton a day up to 2,000 tons a day area which is again what CAR promised but it's all about running to demand. We make a lot of our specialty grades on that particular machine. And that machine is doing everything we need it to do right now. And the good news is that it will help us and be available to grow into the marketplace over the next year or 2 as we need the additional funds off that machine. But it's performing quite well and it's delivering everything that we needed to deliver on an earnings basis and a performance basis.\nMark Weintraub: And can you remind us, you had talked about EBITDA type contribution from Jackson. What's -- is there an updated thought or potential EBITDA contribution. Is there an updated thought now that you've seen that the scope of production could even be higher than what was originally expected.\nMark Kowlzan: Again, I think, Mark, it's delivering what we've talked about for the last 1.5 years to 2 years in terms of the model. But as I said, there's upside opportunity with the incremental tons that will feed into the converting system over the future. There's about a 400 ton a day opportunity as we go forward which is say 100-plus-thousand tons a year over the next couple of years as we feed that through. So that will be upside in EBITDA. But right now, it's delivering what our models told us it would deliver. And I think what some of you analysts have been modeling.\nMark Weintraub: Got you. And then on the increased CapEx, is there any -- a little bit more color in terms of the types of returns you might expect on this increased capital spend?\nMark Kowlzan: We don't get into the exact returns. Obviously, we have a history of high-return projects as a need project that Tom mentioned down in Arizona. We've been looking at an opportunity and a solution for a couple of years to move out of some older inefficient operating facilities. And so that's come about. We've also been aggressively pursuing some converting installations in new corrugators. And so all I'll say is these are very high return, great opportunities in line with our historical capital spend.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. And then it sounds like a mix of cost and increased capacity. Is that fair?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. Let me -- I will point out, people that are wondering, if you went back 10 years ago, you could build a full line plant for probably $80 million, $90 million. The cost to build a full line state-of-the-art plant now has significantly increased and in some cases, starting to approach double what it was 10 years ago. Just to put things in perspective about what it costs to engage in this world that we're living in now.\nMark Weintraub: Right. And is that the size of plant similar? Is that still like an $80,000 type throughput? Or what type of throughputs are you talking about with the -- this new plant.\nMark Kowlzan: This plant down in Arizona when we're done with it will be a couple of billion square feet a year opportunity for us.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. Great. And then lastly. So, obviously, we got pricing in February and PPW, got it in June. Undoubtedly, that's helping the third quarter. Is there much that you would expect of the increases that have already been reflected in PPW to show up in 4Q and beyond? Maybe could you help us start to quantify how to frame it?\nTom Hassfurther: Mark, this is Tom. I'll just tell you that our increase that we're going through right now will roll through as it usually does for PCA over a 90-day period. So we'll see -- we'll begin to see the -- most of the results of that towards the end of the third quarter and certainly realized in the fourth quarter. One of the confusing things and as I mentioned in my comments, relative to the first $40 is a lot of that was offset by the $20 that was announced late last year and -- because it didn't trigger in a lot of contracts. So that kind of hurt us in the first half of the year. But now this $40, we'll roll through it and it will roll through in the normal 90-day period and the non-contractual stuff will roll through in a 30- to 45-day period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Just following up on Mark's question. In terms of the kind of incremental $200 million on CapEx, is primarily all of that or the vast majority of that the Arizona project. And -- yes, I guess that's the first question.\nMark Kowlzan: No, that's a piece of it. We've also -- as the year progressed, we continue to identify ongoing opportunities at existing plants and it's in the line of new corrugators, new converting lines. And so we, again, aggressively have pursued a lot of those opportunities. There is some spending in the mills that we also identified as immediate high return opportunity that we've deployed some of that extra capital into -- and so it's a mix across the board which, again, gives you a good opportunity and mitigates the risk of any 1 big project.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And in terms of sort of timeline for completion for Arizona and then obviously, you're not giving CapEx guidance for '25 but should we think directionally about CapEx maybe maintaining at these levels going forward, stepping down maybe in '25. Are we kind of in a CapEx cycle? Or just any kind of color you could give there would be helpful.\nMark Kowlzan: Yes. As far as the level of spending as long as we have opportunities, we're going to spend to the opportunities and we'll call that out as we have to, we'll give you an update in October for what the year is starting to finish up at. And then in January, we'll clue you into 2025. But I think, again, we've got a history of delivering results and again, I think for the time being, we're in this level of spending. But again, it's immediate high return. It feeds into this tremendous growth that we're seeing. And so we get immediate return for it. As far as the project down in Arizona, I think, Tom, we're kind of looking at late next spring type early part of next year of getting that plant started up.\nTom Hassfurther: Early, probably late first quarter, early second quarter. Yes.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. And I guess, last question. When you look at your end markets and really the strong volumes you've seen between consumer, industrials, durables, logistics, are there specific markets or customer set that is really driving that strength? Or has -- where the strength of demand has surprised you maybe?\nTom Hassfurther: Anthony, I don't think anything surprised us other than probably that the consumer end has held up a lot better than probably anybody had forecast. And the consumer themselves have held up a little bit better. Now that said, they may be spending more from credit card and cutting into their savings account a little bit but the consumers remain pretty damn healthy. I think durables have been a little less healthy only because housing starts have been down. And I think some of the remodeling and just -- and actually getting supply has been a bit of a problem on the durable side. So -- but overall, I mean, when we look at our mix, I mean, there's minor adjustments back and forth. And like I said, on that specialty graphics side, that's kind of flatlined quite a bit. But it's still healthy and it's still similar to a year ago.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo.\nGabe Hajde: Hopefully, a couple of quick ones. One is kind of based on run rate production or I'm going to call it, directionally 5 million tons of capacity. You mentioned, I think you're at all 43,000 tons, I think, of year-over-year increased sales to outside or non-integrated tons. Are you at about 90% integrated at this point? And then on that, call it, 500,000 tons that you're not, to the extent that you do integrate it, should we be thinking about maybe $200 a ton of incremental profit that you realize when you internalize that? And yes, that's the question.\nMark Kowlzan: I think again, the number we're using internally is about a 95% integration. And as far as the value to us, I think you're in the ballpark. Bob, you got any comments?\nBob Mundy: I think it's maybe a little more than that, Gabe but -- yes.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And then we've got some new legislation regulation in the EU and I appreciate you're not in Europe. But just to the extent that it impacts kind of maybe global trade flows or implied values of virgin assets here in the U.S. do you see that putting maybe incremental upward tension on OCC over time as people look to use more in their furnish, or does that not even come into your thought process because you're focused on the U.S.\nMark Kowlzan: I'm very familiar with what you're talking about. We've been paying attention to that at AF&PA for the last year. Again, I think that's the Europeans now realizing some of the unintended consequences of trying to do the right thing. And I think now that the election cycles have been completed in Europe. I think the reality is they're going to have to revisit that whole legislation and understand what the impact is. At the end of the day [indiscernible] passed to have fiber; and so they will resolve that matter. And so I'm personally from PCA's perspective, I'm not real concerned about it right now.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And last one, just on capital. Even with the increased spending, our model kind of has you guys still at 1x levered. You've always obviously taken a balanced approach with the dividend and share repurchase being a little bit more opportunistic. Anything changed either on the M&A front or a different perspective on capital as you look out over the next, I don't know, 12 months to return cash or value to shareholders?\nMark Kowlzan: Everything remains the same. We look at all opportunities, whether it's acquisitions, capital spending opportunities, dividend, share buyback, whatever makes sense at any given time, we're in a great position to be able to take advantage about anything that comes along. So nothing's changed. But we also, again, on the capital side, we have the organization that can quickly execute and take advantage of the ideas that currently come about and the needs that we have to work with our customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies.\nPhilip Ng: Congrats on another strong quarter. I guess the way you guys characterized demand for your major end markets, consumer hanging in there and durable goods still a little squishy. It doesn't exactly line up to the acceleration of box volumes you've seen, call it, the last 2, 3 quarters. So my question is, are you starting to see customers restock -- are these the customers you're aligned, just growing faster or just the investments you've made really allowed you to take share in a more meaningful fashion just because it seems to be lining up a little different from some of the macro data we see currently.\nTom Hassfurther: Phil, this is Tom. I would -- I'm going to go back again just to reemphasize the fact that we have a particular strategy, our go-to-market strategy is a particular one. It's -- we try to align with the right customers. And by that, I mean, the customers that we see that are going to grow going forward. And we work very closely with them to help make us both very successful in the long run and those have proven to be very beneficial to us. We have shied away from some of the other ones that are very seasonal or perhaps a little more jargon [ph] in terms of their demand and fall over periods of time. So this has been a long, long-term strategy that we've had and we continue to execute very well on that. I think there's been a lot of discussion about the capital spend. And that's been a long-term strategy of PCA has been consistently capital spend where the opportunities present themselves. Our financial flexibility allows us to do that sort of thing. And those -- and then consequently, we can take advantage of the opportunities when they present themselves with the marketplace. So that's really -- that really describes this best what we're seeing in the marketplace. And I know that some of our growth may not be consistent with what you might see in a macro trend. But I think when you dig deep and you see certain industries or certain segments, you'll see significantly more growth in some of those than you might in others.\nPhilip Ng: Are you seeing any restocking from your customers at this point?\nTom Hassfurther: Restocking. Our customers typically are keeping a what I would consider to be a very conservative inventory. We got through that whole destocking process quite some time ago now. And they're holding their -- they replenished some inventory but I would term it to be a on the historically lower side of inventory is what they're holding right now.\nPhilip Ng: Okay, that's helpful. And then the step-up in CapEx, Mark [ph] you're not comfortable telling us how the ramp-up curve on CapEx is. But can you give us a little color in terms of the EBITDA contribution ramp up? I mean some of these are smaller, as you pointed out. So should we start seeing some of that benefit this year? Or is it more of a 2025 event? I know the Arizona facility is going to come up sometime in spring but there's start-up costs associated with that. So how should we kind of think about the investments you're making in terms of the ramp-up curve.\nMark Kowlzan: Some of these projects we're doing currently in the box plants with some of the converting lines and corrugators. You'll see benefits this year and then we'll benefit going forward into next year. So without quantifying that, these are, again, very, very immediate quick return opportunities. And again, some of the longer-term projects like the project down in Arizona will be next year. But we currently have a portfolio of activity going on in the box plant. So we've been executing on an ongoing basis all year. And as the year rolled on, we observed more opportunities and we were able to take advantage of that. And so there's always somewhat of a lag but it's always in terms of months, not years.\nPhilip Ng: Super. How are you thinking about build versus buy at this point? I mean a lot of your private competitors have added a lot of capacity in recent years, very low-cost mills but not much of the book of business. Are there any opportunities on the acquisition front potentially out there?\nMark Kowlzan: I don't want to comment about that. Again, that's -- there's always opportunities and we'll take advantage of opportunities when we need to take advantage of them. But I don't want to speculate on anything.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Charlie Muir-Sands of BNP Paribas.\nCharlie Muir-Sands: Just two, please. Firstly, on the new Arizona box plant, you said the capacity of the new site would be 2 billion square feet per annum. Can you just tell us what kind of upgrade that is or what's the capacity of the existing site that you're closing? And then secondly, just on back on the competitive landscape. I appreciate you don't like to talk about individual competitors but it does seem to be a sort of a general trend towards pushing price a bit more -- is that something that you are tempted or able to follow? Or are you more inclined towards gaining market share and driving operating leverage?\nMark Kowlzan: On your second part there, we're not going to talk about price. But on your first part of your question, we're going to more than double the capacity down in Arizona. Tom, do you want to give a few more details on that?\nTom Hassfurther: Yes, there's not a lot to talk about other than the fact that we are clearly out of capacity in that marketplace. We're not able to service the customers locally like we'd like to, we're having to pull from a lot of different plants and most of the plants are quite far away in the L.A. region or something like that in order to service that market. And that's not sustainable long term. So with the opportunities we have and with the customers that we have in that marketplace, they've indicated that we need to do significantly different things which we will do. And that will give us some -- obviously, some great opportunities in that region.\nMark Kowlzan: And if you look back at our portfolio of opportunities over the last 6 years, in general, we've taken a lot of these older plants that needed to be recapitalized. And we've increased productivity on a unit labor hour basis. We tripled quadrupled the productivity coming out of these plants and cut costs and done it with a lot less labor hours. So it's again, the plant in Arizona will be a really big opportunity for us to take care of that whole region.\nOperator: Mr. Kowlzan, I see there are no more questions. Do you have any closing comments?\nMark Kowlzan: Alan, thank you. And again, everybody that participated. I want to thank you for joining us today and look forward to talking with you in October to review the third quarter call. Have a nice day. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Along with the record-setting containerboard production that Mark mentioned, corrugated products demand strengthened throughout the quarter and ended with a new shipments per day record for the month of June. In fact, we were just 0.1% away from our all-time second quarter total shipments record. Shipments per day were up 9.2% over last year's second quarter and total shipments with 1 additional shipping day were up 10.9%. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 42,000 tons above last year's second quarter and 35,000 tons above the first quarter of 2024. Segment prices and mix moved higher as we continue to implement our price increases from February which was negatively impacted by the late fourth quarter 2023 decrease reported by the RISI publication along with the more recent increase in June. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were up $0.09 per share compared to the first quarter of 2024. However, they were $0.84 per share below the second quarter of 2023. Export containerboard prices were up $0.03 per share versus the first quarter and down $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2023. Finally, some of you may have seen news about an investment we made in the Phoenix, Arizona area. In order to serve a growing market and to grow with our existing customers, we are in the process of replacing our current Phoenix corrugated products plant with a modern state-of-the-art facility. Like many of our strategic projects, the Phoenix project improves the capacity, technology and equipment in the plant gets us aligned properly in the right marketplaces addresses the needs of our customers so that we both grow profitably and improves the efficiencies and cost within our system. I'll now turn it back to Mark. George, this is Tom. Yes, bookings remain very robust. Bookings and billings both remain very robust. Through 12 days, we're up 12.5% so far in July. So an incredibly good start to the quarter. We had a very good start to last quarter. We exited at a higher rate and we're continuing that higher rate as you see going into the third quarter. Thanks, George. Now I'll address what I can, okay? And to give you as much color as I possibly can. What's happening with our mix is, is that the growth the growth we see within our existing accounts and some of the new business that we brought on is primarily in the brown area. And if you look at what's happening overall as we see it in the marketplace, some of that specialty business which would be graphics-oriented and some of those sorts of things have remained relatively stable, whereas the other growth has been primarily in brown. So from a mix standpoint, it's a slight change. It's not this big dramatic change or anything like that. But this is -- our growth is a result of a team working incredibly well, performing at a very high level, remaining incredibly focused on the customer and aligning ourselves with the markets and the customers that we choose to do business with. Well, Mike, I would just say, listen, I mean, we don't really comment on our competition or what our competition is doing. We have our strategy, we go execute our strategy in the marketplace. And that is, as I've mentioned before, aligning with the right customers in the right segments. That's what we try to do. And what our competition is working on or is doing at the moment is really their plan, their program. And so I've got very little to comment on that. Mark, this is Tom. I'll just tell you that our increase that we're going through right now will roll through as it usually does for PCA over a 90-day period.

Anthony, I don't think anything surprised us other than probably that the consumer end has held up a lot better than probably anybody had forecast. And the consumer themselves have held up a little bit better. Now that said, they may be spending more from credit card and cutting into their savings account a little bit but the consumers remain pretty damn healthy.

Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs the Packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of the second quarter results. And then I'll be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up and we'll be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $199 million or $2.21 per share. Excluding special items, second quarter 2024 net income was $199 million or $2.20 per share compared to the second quarter 2023 net income of $209 million or $2.31 per share. Second quarter net sales were $2.1 billion in 2024 and $2 billion in 2023. Total company EBITDA for the second quarter excluding special items, was $404 million in 2024 and $418 million in 2023. The details of special items for both the second quarter of '24 and 2023 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release. Excluding special items, the $0.11 per share decrease in second quarter 2024 earnings compared to the second quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging segment for $0.87 and Paper segment $0.07. Even with our constant focus on minimizing inflationary cost increases, operating costs were higher by $0.31 per share. This was particularly in the areas of recycled fiber and inflation-driven increases on labor and benefits, outside service expenses, repair and operating material costs, rents, property taxes and insurance. We also had higher depreciation expense of $0.03 and a higher tax rate of $0.03. These items were partially offset by higher volume in the Packaging segment for $0.94 and Paper segment $0.07, lower other converting costs, $0.07, lower freight and logistics expenses, $0.06 and lower interest expense, $0.06. Looking at the Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter of 2024 of $400 million with sales of $1.9 billion resulted in a margin of 21% versus last year's EBITDA of $405 million and sales of $1.8 billion or a 23% margin. The strong market conditions in our Packaging segment continued in the second quarter. This drove a new all-time containerboard production record that was necessary in order to service the corrugated products and containerboard demand. Also, Packaging segment prices and mix moved higher from the first quarter levels as we continue to implement our announced price increases. Although still below target levels, we were able to build some inventory ahead of what we expect to be a very busy second half of the year. In our mills and corrugated products facilities, employees remain focused on efficient and cost-effective operations from thousands of initiatives as well as implementing the benefits and improvements from our capital spending strategy. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on the containerboard sales and corrugated business in general. Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the second quarter was $31 million with sales of $150 million or a 20.4% margin compared to the second quarter of 2023 EBITDA of $39 million and sales of $143 million or a 27.2% margin. Paper segment prices and mix as well as volume came in as expected. And as we mentioned last quarter, although we are implementing our recently announced paper price increases, the published decrease in index prices earlier this year and how that impacts contract triggers with certain customers would initially delay the timing of realizing the increases. Overall, average prices and mix were essentially flat with the first quarter 2024 levels and down 5.6% versus the second quarter of 2023. Market conditions versus last year were solid with volume up 12% versus the second quarter of 2023 driven somewhat by the timing of seasonal back-to-school business. Volume was 8% below the first quarter of 2024, impacted by the scheduled maintenance outage at the International Falls, Minnesota mill as well as exceptionally strong volume in the first quarter. Similar to the comments I made regarding the packaging business, employees in the Paper business remain focused on very efficient and cost-effective operations and executed the outage International Falls very well and slightly below our cost estimates. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thank you, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the second quarter into the third quarter, prices and mix in both our Packaging and Paper segments will move higher as we continue to implement previously announced increases along with higher containerboard export prices. Although there is one less shipping day for the corrugated business, we expect shipments per day to continue to strengthen, potentially setting a new third quarter record. We also expect higher containerboard volume. With current containerboard inventory below our target levels, we will also attempt to build some inventory ahead of the scheduled maintenance outage at our DeRidder Mill in October. Paper volume will be slightly lower primarily due to timing of back-to-school business that was received in the second quarter. Operating and converting costs should be higher primarily due to seasonal electricity usage and prices and slightly higher recycled fiber costs with scheduled outage expense expected to be slightly lower. Considering these items, we expect third quarter earnings of $2.45 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call today constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K which is on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Alan, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please. Yes. Well, again, Mike, volume was the big factor. Obviously, operational efficiencies but the big volume boost was the positive there. Yes. Exactly. Yes. Personally, I don't have any concerns about that. People have talked about that for a number of years. But again, Tom, why don't you weigh in on that also? Jackson is delivering exactly what we needed to do. When we talked about this project 2 years ago, we said it was a 2,000 ton a day project, quite frankly, we've exceeded that. We've proven that the machine can run up with 2,400 tons a day which would be 800,000 ton a year run rate. Currently, for the last couple of months, we've been running in the 1,900 ton a day up to 2,000 tons a day area which is again what CAR promised but it's all about running to demand. We make a lot of our specialty grades on that particular machine. And that machine is doing everything we need it to do right now. And the good news is that it will help us and be available to grow into the marketplace over the next year or 2 as we need the additional funds off that machine. But it's performing quite well and it's delivering everything that we needed to deliver on an earnings basis and a performance basis. Again, I think, Mark, it's delivering what we've talked about for the last 1.5 years to 2 years in terms of the model. But as I said, there's upside opportunity with the incremental tons that will feed into the converting system over the future. There's about a 400 ton a day opportunity as we go forward which is say 100-plus-thousand tons a year over the next couple of years as we feed that through. So that will be upside in EBITDA. But right now, it's delivering what our models told us it would deliver. And I think what some of you analysts have been modeling. We don't get into the exact returns. Obviously, we have a history of high-return projects as a need project that Tom mentioned down in Arizona. We've been looking at an opportunity and a solution for a couple of years to move out of some older inefficient operating facilities. And so that's come about. We've also been aggressively pursuing some converting installations in new corrugators. And so all I'll say is these are very high return, great opportunities in line with our historical capital spend. Yes. Let me -- I will point out, people that are wondering, if you went back 10 years ago, you could build a full line plant for probably $80 million, $90 million. The cost to build a full line state-of-the-art plant now has significantly increased and in some cases, starting to approach double what it was 10 years ago. Just to put things in perspective about what it costs to engage in this world that we're living in now. This plant down in Arizona when we're done with it will be a couple of billion square feet a year opportunity for us. No, that's a piece of it. We've also -- as the year progressed, we continue to identify ongoing opportunities at existing plants and it's in the line of new corrugators, new converting lines. And so we, again, aggressively have pursued a lot of those opportunities. There is some spending in the mills that we also identified as immediate high return opportunity that we've deployed some of that extra capital into -- and so it's a mix across the board which, again, gives you a good opportunity and mitigates the risk of any 1 big project. Yes. As far as the level of spending as long as we have opportunities, we're going to spend to the opportunities and we'll call that out as we have to, we'll give you an update in October for what the year is starting to finish up at. And then in January, we'll clue you into 2025. But I think, again, we've got a history of delivering results and again, I think for the time being, we're in this level of spending. But again, it's immediate high return. It feeds into this tremendous growth that we're seeing. And so we get immediate return for it. As far as the project down in Arizona, I think, Tom, we're kind of looking at late next spring type early part of next year of getting that plant started up. I think again, the number we're using internally is about a 95% integration. And as far as the value to us, I think you're in the ballpark. Bob, you got any comments? I'm very familiar with what you're talking about. We've been paying attention to that at AF&PA for the last year. Again, I think that's the Europeans now realizing some of the unintended consequences of trying to do the right thing. And I think now that the election cycles have been completed in Europe. I think the reality is they're going to have to revisit that whole legislation and understand what the impact is. At the end of the day [indiscernible] passed to have fiber; and so they will resolve that matter. And so I'm personally from PCA's perspective, I'm not real concerned about it right now. Everything remains the same. We look at all opportunities, whether it's acquisitions, capital spending opportunities, dividend, share buyback, whatever makes sense at any given time, we're in a great position to be able to take advantage about anything that comes along. So nothing's changed. But we also, again, on the capital side, we have the organization that can quickly execute and take advantage of the ideas that currently come about and the needs that we have to work with our customers. Some of these projects we're doing currently in the box plants with some of the converting lines and corrugators. You'll see benefits this year and then we'll benefit going forward into next year. So without quantifying that, these are, again, very, very immediate quick return opportunities. And again, some of the longer-term projects like the project down in Arizona will be next year. But we currently have a portfolio of activity going on in the box plant. So we've been executing on an ongoing basis all year. And as the year rolled on, we observed more opportunities and we were able to take advantage of that. And so there's always somewhat of a lag but it's always in terms of months, not years. I don't want to comment about that. Again, that's -- there's always opportunities and we'll take advantage of opportunities when we need to take advantage of them. But I don't want to speculate on anything. On your second part there, we're not going to talk about price. But on your first part of your question, we're going to more than double the capacity down in Arizona. Tom, do you want to give a few more details on that? And if you look back at our portfolio of opportunities over the last 6 years, in general, we've taken a lot of these older plants that needed to be recapitalized. And we've increased productivity on a unit labor hour basis. We tripled quadrupled the productivity coming out of these plants and cut costs and done it with a lot less labor hours. So it's again, the plant in Arizona will be a really big opportunity for us to take care of that whole region. Alan, thank you. And again, everybody that participated. I want to thank you for joining us today and look forward to talking with you in October to review the third quarter call. Have a nice day. Bye, bye."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $278 million and free cash flow was $33 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $245 million, dividend payments of $112 million, cash taxes of $100 million and interest payments of $37 million. Excluding the invested cash proceeds from the bond transaction we'll use to retire the $400 million bond that matures in September. Our quarter end cash balance, including marketable securities was approximately $800 million with liquidity of $1.1 billion. We mentioned on last quarter's call that today we would provide an update on our capital spending guidance. We are revising our full year guidance from a range of $470 million to $490 million to a range of $670 million to $690 million. The increase is primarily attributable to additional high-return, profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities within our box plants as well as the new greenfield box plant in Phoenix that Tom spoke of. Spending for these projects fits in very well with our expected cash flow and balanced approach towards cash allocation in order to grow profitably our company and maximize returns to our shareholders. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yes, George, this is Bob. I think what you're seeing is year-over-year in the second quarter, we ran Wallula full in the second quarter, whereas last year, they ran only 1 month of the quarter. And of course, as you know, Wallula is our highest cost mills. So it was a big mill mix impact that affected cost plus, I think, the year-over-year on energy and like you said, OCC, that was higher in the second quarter than it was in the first. And I think that will pretty much close that gap when you look at it that way. And then going from the second to the third, I think you'll see, your other question. We didn't mention a lot in the guidance relative to cost because it should be fairly stable, up slightly, like we said for OCC and more electrical usage in rates. But other than that, it should be fairly -- maybe chemical is up a little bit but not as much sequential movement as we've seen in the past. Yes. Yes, exactly. I think it's maybe a little more than that, Gabe but -- yes."

Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. And please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs the Packaging business, and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results, and then I'll be turning it over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $147 million or $1.63 per share. Excluding special items, first quarter 2024 net income was $155 million or $1.72 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023's net income of $198 million or $2.20 per share. Our first quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2024 and 2023. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $333 million in 2024 and $405 million in 2023. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.09 per share, primarily for certain costs at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. Details of special items for both the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.48 per share decrease in first quarter 2024 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in the Packaging segment for $1.33, and Paper segment $0.08, higher scheduled mill outage expense $0.10, higher depreciation $0.03, higher expenses related to corrugated plant capital projects of $0.02 and other expenses $0.04. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in the Packaging segment for $0.71, and Paper segment $0.06. We also had lower operating and converting costs of $0.15 driven by very good process efficiencies and control over other usages of fiber, chemicals, energy, materials and labor. Although energy prices were lower versus last year's first quarter, they were more than offset by higher recycled fiber prices. In addition, we had lower freight and logistics expenses for $0.04, lower interest expense $0.07 and lower tax rate $0.09. The results were $0.18 above the first quarter guidance of $1.54 per share, primarily due to the strong volume in both the Packaging and Paper segments, along with the continued emphasis on cost management and process efficiencies across our manufacturing and converting facilities. This drove operating and converting costs lower even with the persistent inflation we continue to experience across most of the cost structure. Executing the conversion outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill better than planned resulted in lower scheduled mill maintenance outages, expenses and freight and logistics expenses were less than guidance as well. Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2024 of $326 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 18.1% versus last year's EBITDA of $392 million or sales of $1.8 billion or 21.7% margin. Throughout the quarter, containerboard and corrugated products demand exceeded our expectations. In addition to outstanding operational performance at our box plants and containerboard mills, we were able to service the high demand from excellent execution of the convert -- of the conversion outage at our Jackson mill. This enabled us to restart both machines earlier than anticipated and we completed our work prior to the quarter-end rather than in the month of April, which had been the original plan. Despite these efforts, with the higher demand, we ended the quarter at a record-low weeks of inventory supply for this time of year. With just our Filer, Michigan mill having a scheduled maintenance outage in the second quarter, we do expect to build our inventories back to targeted levels by the end of this quarter. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business in general.\nTom Hassfurther: Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned, Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 11% and total shipments with one less shipping day were up 9.2% compared to last year's first quarter. Compared to the pre-COVID period of the first quarter of 2019, shipments were up over 10.4% on a per day basis. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 40,000 tons above last year's first quarter and 15,000 tons below the fourth quarter of 2023. Our order backlog remained incredibly strong throughout the quarter, and although demand continues to be challenged by constant inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, we expect to continue this positive momentum as we enter the second quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together moved slightly higher from the fourth quarter of 2023 levels by $0.01 per share, which was less than we anticipated due to our total announced increase not being recognized in the published benchmark prices. Versus the first quarter of 2023, prices and mix were down $1.19 per share. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.01 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and down $0.14 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to point out that the capital spending and optimization strategy within our box plant system that we have been continuously focused on over the last few years is providing incredible benefits. This has allowed us to focus on the mix of customers we want to profitably grow our revenues with by providing them the product and service needs they desire and allows them to grow. Based on our current demand outlook for this year, this strategy has us on pace to set a new record for box shipments per plant. I'll now turn it back to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter was $41 million with sales of $164 million or 25% margin compared to the first quarter of 2023's EBITDA of $41 million and sales of $151 million or 27% margin. Sales volume, which exceeded our guidance estimates, was 14% above the fourth quarter of 2023 and 16% above the first quarter of 2023. Demand was very good both from our existing customers as well as incremental volume from some new customers as we acquire -- that we acquired towards the end of 2023. Orders remain strong as we enter the second quarter, although volume will be impacted by the scheduled maintenance outage at our International Falls, Minnesota mill in June. An improved sales mix moved paper prices slightly above the fourth quarter of 2023, although prices and mix were down about 6% from last year's first quarter. This past February, we announced $100 price increase across all of our paper grades and we began implementing these increases on April 1. I'll now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $260 million and free cash flow was a first quarter record $184 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $77 million and dividend payments of $112 million. Excluding the invested cash proceeds from the bond transaction we mentioned on last quarter's call, our quarter-end cash balance, including marketable securities was approximately $900 million with liquidity of $1.2 billion. Due to the excellent execution of the conversion outage at the Jackson mill that Mark spoke of and moving the International Falls mill outage from the third quarter and into the second quarter, we are revising the scheduled mill outage guidance we provided on last quarter's call. The revised total company estimated cost impact for the year is now $0.89 per share versus $0.96 per share previously. The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.24 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.18 per share in the second quarter, $0.14 in the third, and $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand and higher corrugated products and containerboard shipments. Prices and mix will move higher due to our announced price increases and increase in published domestic index prices as well as higher export prices. Orders in our Paper segment are expected to remain strong, however volumes will be lower due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the International Falls Minnesota mill during the quarter. Although we're implementing our recently announced paper price increases, the average prices and mix are expected to be slightly lower due to the published decrease in index prices earlier this year and how that impacts contract triggers with certain customers. Operating and converting costs should be slightly lower, primarily due to the sequential improvement in seasonal weather and wage and benefit timing expenses that we incurred in the first quarter and scheduled maintenance outage expenses will be lower. Rail rate increases at six of our mills during the first and second quarters will result in higher freight and logistics expenses and depreciation expense will be higher. Finally, our tax rate will be sequentially higher due to the tax-related benefit of share-based compensation vests in the first quarter. Considering these items, we expect the second quarter earnings of $2.07 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute the forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Hope you're doing well. Thanks for the details. I guess the first question, maybe the standard one for all of us, can you talk to what the early trends are in terms of bookings and billings so far in 2Q? And then I had a couple of follow-ons.\nTom Hassfurther: George, this is Tom. Yeah, bookings remain very strong, as I indicated in the -- in the call earlier in the script, were up 8% as of now. And we can -- we expect a strong second quarter and the remainder of the year as well.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks for that, Tom. Can you talk a bit about what your vertical integration was in 1Q and also in 4Q? And if you don't want to provide -- and we understand an absolute level, can you talk about what the relative trend was? And similarly, can you talk about how the mix of your business was, third-party in export in 1Q and similarly relative to what you saw in 4Q?\nMark Kowlzan: Bob?\nBob Mundy: Yeah, yeah, I don't have the absolute -- yeah, the integration in the first quarter was around 90%, almost 93%, George. And slightly below that, I think it was in the fourth quarter.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, Bob.\nGeorge Staphos: Okay. I guess the last one, and I'll -- please go ahead.\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, Tom, do you want to comment about mix and...\nTom Hassfurther: Right. Are you asking about mix of export or you ask -- what exactly you're asking, George?\nGeorge Staphos: Really, I was asking about how much was export tonnage 1Q either directionally versus 4Q in absolute terms in terms of percentage of tonnage, whatever sort of qualitative or quantitative data you could provide us 1Q and 4Q. And really the last question related to it and I'll turn it over is, you know for all of the volume, kudos to you in terms of the shipments, the operating -- the EBITDA margin was less than we had been modeling for. And I'm trying to figure out where that loss of margin, at least versus our model, maybe we're just too optimistic was whether it was a mix or something else in terms of the quarter. Thank you. I'll turn it over there.\nTom Hassfurther: Let me see if I can tie this together here real quick for you, George.\nGeorge Staphos: Thank you.\nTom Hassfurther: Number one is the export. The export in first quarter versus fourth quarter, as I indicated was down slightly. Fourth quarter is a big export time for us. And -- but on an overall basis, it was pretty flat. Relative to the EBITDA margins, I think one of the things that probably you might be missing in the model was the fact that the $20 downturn that took place last year, some of that bled into the first of the year because of contract triggers. And of course, we were counting on the $70 being published and the only $40 was published and it was slightly delayed. So the roll through in the price increase did not occur quite as quickly as we had hoped and not in the same amount because of the index. In addition to that, I just want to remind you that inflation remains very sticky. And I think there is a lot of noise around inflation, the rate of inflation having slowed from that rapid rate during COVID, but it's still going up. And it's been going up, at the same time, the index has indicated prices going in the opposite direction until this $40 increase. So I think that's -- I think that's where the -- where the margin gap is.\nMark Kowlzan: George, there's a lot of elements within the cost structure that people lose sight of. I mean, if you keep in mind, I mean things just like general services that a paper mill or box plant relies on, all these associated costs to run the business are up dramatically over the last few years and they're not easing up. Bob, do you want to comment on this? Again, I think people are truly, truly missing that.\nBob Mundy: Yeah. Yeah, Mark. I mean the things and even as we go into the second quarter from the first, obviously, recycled fiber, wood may be a little bit higher from a price standpoint, electrical rate, even though gas is down, electrical rates are not. Chemicals, whether it be lime, adhesives in the box plants, resins, alums, starch across the board, all moving higher. And again, we typically talk about all the direct type of costs and which is only about 40% of our cost base, you have the other 60% which are, as Mark referenced, there are maintenance services, repairs, materials, operating material supplies, property taxes, rent, warehouse cost, insurance leases. So it's -- there is constant inflation and all the people that supply those things, they have the same inflation going on in their business and they don't eat it. They pass it on to us. So a lot of that just gets overlooked, I think, George.\nGeorge Staphos: I appreciate all the color, guys. I'll turn it over. Thank you very much.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Roxland from Truist. Please go ahead with your question.\nNicco Piccini: Thank you, Mark, Tom and Bob for taking my questions. This is Nicco Piccini on for Mike. I guess just realizing that demand has improved across the board, are there any particular sectors or end-markets where you saw more notable improvement, and then anything lagging?\nMark Kowlzan: I can tell you, the demand improved across the board, believe it or not. When we look at the various segments, whether it's e-com, ag, food, even in the heavier manufacturing area, we had significant improvement across the board.\nNicco Piccini: Got it. Thank you. And then just following up, since roughly 2019, you spent like a deal of time and money recapitalizing your box plants. Can you comment on maybe if there's anything left to do there realizing there's always some level of work to be done?\nMark Kowlzan: We've got this momentum going right now that we started good five or six years ago. And quite frankly, as we've done on the mill side now, the opportunity to continue to capitalize on the box plant opportunity will continue infinitum for us. That's part of our growth strategy. That's how we'll continue to provide value for our customer base. And so again, Tom, again just...\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think I would add -- I think it's a good reminder always that our capital plants and the box plants are built around our customers. And our customers that we're aligned with are in growth mode and that's a big benefit to us. And we'll continue to invest around those customers.\nMark Kowlzan: Again, I think I commented on the January call in the last five years since 2019, we've installed 69 new converting machines. We've replaced or completely upgraded 25 of our corrugators. We built four new plants, Marshfield, Richland, Landisville and Salt Lake City specialty. In Salt Lake City, we just started up in the last month, so that's our newest one. And so we continue to do this as Tom mentioned, it's all done to grow with the customer and take care of what the customer needs are. But we have this capability and it's -- again, we'll continue to capitalize on the strength.\nNicco Piccini: Understood. Thank you very much for the commentary.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. First, are you now done with the Jackson project conversion? Is that now fully set?\nMark Kowlzan: Yes, everything that we had sculped out four years ago is complete, and that project has turned out, as you can imagine, we're more pleased than we thought we were going to be at this time. The original phase of work that we just completed was originally a 58-day schedule. We completed that two weeks ahead of time, started up the day before Easter, and have been running extremely well ever since. And as I've talked over the last year, I expected that machine to be producing over 2,000 tons a day and we've been doing that for the last week or two. And so, getting that mill stretched out now, and getting everybody used to running at these high production rates, but the good news is we need every ton that we can produce. And this is all high-performance grade lightweight linerboard coming off that machine. And so it's doing everything that we expected it to do and more.\nMark Weintraub: Congrats on that. So now with Jackson up and running for -- I think in the second quarter, you produced a little under 1.2 million tons. Maybe on an annualized basis, what would your full production potential be assuming the demand is there for you to run for?\nMark Kowlzan: If you include the seven mill system, would be a little bit over 5 million tons. If you round off 5 million tons system, a little over 5 million tons, 5.2 million or so.\nMark Weintraub: Okay.\nMark Kowlzan: Depending on the grade mix that you're running as far as lightweights basis weight, 5 million, 5.2 million is a good number going forward on a run rate basis.\nMark Weintraub: Excellent. And then lastly, just want to come back to the up 8% on at least in April, et cetera. If I look at where your first-quarter daily shipments were relative to your second-quarter '23 daily shipments, they were up about 8% as well. And I realize we're talking about different time periods when you're referencing April specifically. But so the question is, I mean, are you still seeing momentum of demand getting stronger in the current environment? Or is it more that you had this uptick, you gained business and it's sort of stable at those higher levels?\nMark Kowlzan: Mark, it's still going up, it's going up at a lesser rate, but still we're going up and -- but second quarter is always an interesting one for us versus the third and fourth, which are more predictable because we have -- we take -- seasonality is kind of a little more iffy in the second quarter. But we still see that momentum going up and then we expect it to continue to go up again in the third and fourth quarters of the year.\nMark Weintraub: Okay. And then one last quick one. So I -- and if I read it right, your cap spend was pretty low, I think like $72 million or something in the first quarter. What are you expecting full-year on CapEx and maybe depending on the number, if it's -- I thought you were going to be spending a fairly sizable amount still this year. And maybe help us with Jackson now done, what these new monies are going to be spent on?\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, Mark, that was a timing issue as far as just how the invoicing is done against the projects. We called out that somewhere in that higher 400 level, and we'll give you some updates in July. We always reserve the right as an example, if new opportunities come along, we move forward with these opportunities. And so right now, we're in that high $400 million area. But again, we'll give you some update. If there's any -- if there is any change, we'll update you in July.\nMark Weintraub: Thank you. I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nGabe Hajde: Mark, Bob, Tom, good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nGabe Hajde: Thank you for all the detail. I wanted to ask and I guess revisit the price question, which I know is a little tricky sometimes. But going back to the Q4 call, you had made some comments, Mark, that you were going to try to -- these are my words, kind of decouple from RISI indices to the extent you're able to. And then now we're reading on a sequential basis that we got the $40 a ton posted in February, we had expected $70. And so it feels like a headwind relative to what you were expecting or maybe we all were expecting going back to the kind of the price-cost squeeze that we all mismodeled in the first quarter. So I'm curious if that is proving more challenging. And I'm just asking in the context of this is kind of blazing new trails relative to what we're used to when analyzing this industry. So that's part number one. And then part number two, not asking about future price increases, but given what you've described and history of implementing price increases, is it fair to say that the January 1 price increase is now -- and again, I know it's RISI and what they do, but commercially speaking, if you deemed it appropriate going-forward that you would have to nominate something new. Thank you.\nTom Hassfurther: Gabe, this is Tom. That's a great question you have, especially relative to the decoupling from RISI. As I indicated in our last call, this would not be an easy task and it's going to take some time. But we're still pressing forward with that, driven again by our customers' frustration over what is going on and what gets reported these days. If you just work through at least from PCA's perspective, if you look through the -- walk through the math and you said, well, liner came down $110 after its peak and medium a little bit more, we would need to have a significant recovery to get back to those kind of levels. And as I also indicated, inflation continues to take place. So there's a -- even customers have said to us that if things had just remained the same from the peak, they would have -- they'd almost prefer that just because they just don't like these roller-coaster rides, and they're trying to get off of that down and then up and then down and then up, and these sorts of things. So -- and over a long period of time, we could have managed that in a much smoother fashion. So these are the kind of discussions we're having with our customers. Our customers are very open to alternatives and different methods. But you got to remember, a lot of these contracts are long-term contracts. They have different trigger points, they have different times when we're negotiating them. And so we are where we are at this point in time. And the other thing that we talked about was that when we announced this increase, the increase was on containerboard. And it wasn't -- the announcement wasn't on boxes. That's between us and our customers, but we announced it on the open-market of containerboard, and we implemented it. It didn't get reported quite that same way, but that's part of our frustration. I think that relative to future pricing, we don't -- we don't really discuss future pricing and we don't make any indication of what we're going to do in the future, but you could probably -- you probably read through where we are and some of the inflationary pressures that are taking place. And the last reminder is that it's -- there -- all increases aren't strictly on supply and demand. Sometimes they have to do just costs. And costs in general and some costs that we're trying to minimize as much as we possibly can, but in lots of cases, we can\u2019t. So hopefully that gives you the -- hopefully that gives you a good indication of where we are.\nGabe Hajde: No, crystal clear. Thank you, Tom. Maybe just, I don't know, Bob, if you can quantify, I think kind of standard repricing for rail occurs in and around April 1. You called it out, I think roughly two-thirds or so of your parent rolls gets shipped around rail and then the majority of converted product is mostly trucked. So just maybe can you frame up maybe what the increases were or what portion of your transport spend is rail specifically?\nTom Hassfurther: I think in total spendm Gabe, it's like 65% or so is rail, I believe.\nGabe Hajde: Okay. And one last one, very subjective, but given the fact that your two largest competitors right now are pursuing transatlantic combinations, do you see any opportunity, Mark, either organically or potentially if there's a required divestiture to pick up business along the way? Again, appreciating it. I know it's a sensitive topic. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, I don't have any comment regarding that. That's at some place it's -- I won't go. But as you can imagine, we take advantage of opportunities as they come along.\nGabe Hajde: Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning.\nMark Kowlzan: Good morning.\nAnthony Pettinari: On the last call, you talked about expectations for I think $0.35 sequential headwind in 1Q on seasonal costs that I think were mostly labor and benefits related, and maybe being able to get 60% of that coming back in 2Q. If I got that right, I'm just wondering how given where you shook out in 1Q and the 2Q guidance, how that kind of played out versus expectations?\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, Anthony, I think it played -- we did a little bit better, I think on what the impact was in 1Q. But in our 2Q guidance, what I indicated, I think like you said, I think it was 60% of those seasonal or one-time items on the wage side of cost. We are seeing those in our guidance for the second quarter.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And then just following up on Gabe's earlier question on pricing mechanisms, a lot of packagers have contracts where they get kind of an automatic pass-through on their primary raw material, whether that's aluminum or polyethylene. I'm just wondering kind of conceptually, big picture, would it be possible to structure contracts where fiber is just passed through automatically, whether that's OCC or virgin fiber or is there something about craft line or test line or boxes where maybe there's too many SKUs or there's too many customers or it's just it makes that kind of automatic pass-through more difficult.\nTom Hassfurther: I think it's a...\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, Tom, go ahead...\nTom Hassfurther: Anthony, I think it's a fair question, but far more complicated than I think you have in a lot of other materials. And I'd also like to add that in containerboard, not every sheet is the same. And you have a lot of variance between everything between 100% virgin and 100% recycled and a lot of technology in between there on performance liners, et cetera. So there's just a whole myriad of things that go into the process that would have to be taken into account. And it's not as simple as just taking that raw fiber or something like that as your single material.\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, I just wanted to emphasize that maybe once upon a time, when a decade ago, things were more stable in general with inflationary activity and fiber would move up and down and -- but now the last number of years, we're in a world where inflation is back on track at the way it was decades ago and you're seeing across-the-board all your input costs up dramatically. And as Tom said, it would be too complex to try to tie that into some type of mechanism. But don't forget again just like 25 years ago, transportation was a very minimal cost factor in moving containerboard and paper products around the country. Now transportation factor is in as a major -- very significant major element to the cost, just that one component.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. I'm just wondering in kind of previous periods of very strong inflation or maybe going back to the '70s or was the paper industry using things like surcharges? I'm just trying to think about other kind of pricing mechanisms that have been used historically. Obviously, not talking about any kind of future actions. But Bob listed out that you know those categories that are all seeing inflation. I'm just wondering as you look at the history of the industry, were there sort of other ways that producers were able to pass those along?\nTom Hassfurther: Anthony, this is Tom again. We're exploring all the potentials and we're doing it in detail with our customers. And so I think we'll just see where this unfolds over time. But -- and we're learning a little bit too on our side because we're getting it from all our suppliers and we're getting all of the above from all of our suppliers. And that's part of the inflation problem and the cost problem that we're incurring. So we're taking everything into account and -- but this will be solved directly with our customers.\nMark Kowlzan: Yeah, suffice it to say, we'll be far better off going forward.\nAnthony Pettinari: Understand. I appreciate it, and appreciate it's a difficult question to answer in this kind of format. But appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Ng from Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead with your question.\nPhilip Ng: Hey, guys. Your box shipments were obviously really strong during the quarter. It seems like you're outpacing the market handily. Tom, you kind of talked about some of the investments you've made on the box side in market, I think you talked about momentum kind of building there. Has that been like a big area of differentiation that's kind of helped you take share a little faster and grow a little faster than your peers? Anything you want to call out in terms of these investments you've made that makes PCA even more competitive than years past?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, I think, Phil, the -- yes, there's -- it's been a big plus for us. There's no question about it, otherwise we wouldn't have embarked on it. I've said many times, we don't build it and hope they will come. We do what our customers need us to do and invest where they need us to invest. And that's what we've been doing. And it's coupled with making our system more efficient, getting ourselves aligned properly in the right marketplaces, getting ourselves aligned with the right customers. And that's -- I think that's a huge plus. Now in addition to that, I think what helps us a lot is the fact that we're building a better-quality product every day, we're able to turn much faster and meet demands and work as a -- and work as a complete system. Makes a huge difference for us and our customers definitely appreciate it, and I think that's showing up in the business that we're capitalizing on.\nMark Kowlzan: If you went back over the last five years, if you think about labor input cost and labor unit applied per square foot of product or ton of product, we've significantly improved the productivity and cost structure of every one of these converting facilities and full-line box plants. We're producing -- we quadrupled in many cases, doubled the productivity on average out of a box plant. And so it's given us incredible flexibility on how we grow with these customers and the capability to service these customers and do it in a very efficient manner. And that's where, again, we're able now to continue that momentum and we're not playing catch-up. We're in very good -- all of our box plants, our paper mills were in very good position as far as our cost structure and efficiencies to compete. And so we just lay in the new investments that, as Tom has said, we grow with the customer. And so again, but we've been doing this for decades. There's nothing that we just came up with the idea five years ago, we're going to do this. We've been working at this for a couple of decades and we've been fine-tuning this and making it better. And it's just in the last five years, we focused heavily within the box plant system with this organizational change we made in 2019.\nPhilip Ng: Super. That's helpful. And I guess a question on the pricing side of things. Since only $40 to the $70 linerboard increase got reflected in the index, just from a logistics standpoint, are you issuing rebates to your customers? And then I guess separately, the trade publication kind of reported maybe perhaps some of the independent box makers were a little reluctant to push price just given a more mixed demand backdrop for them. How did the box price increase progress? And do you kind of expect it to kind of proceed like normal?\nMark Kowlzan: Relative to the box price increase, it's going to flow through as normal over a 90-day period. We'll have a little bit of -- we'll have a little bit of lag into the midyear because we do have some contracts that have triggers in the midyear. But the lion's share of it as usual will roll in over 90-day period. We are not -- I'm not going to discuss what we do individually with our customers or anything like that, but we did put the $70 price increase through and on containerboard, as I indicated last time, and that's been done for quite some time. And that's basically what we expect now. Relative to an independent or whatever talking about supply-demand or whatever the case might be, I mean, that's part of the whole frustration of the model that exists right now because as I've indicated many times, the open market is incredibly small today. And when I hear things about 70% of the surveyed -- of the survey says X or Y, that's 70% of what, 1% or something. I don't know what the -- how those percentages work out, and there's no indication of that. So that's why we've, as I indicated last time some of the need to have some consideration for perhaps some other mechanisms.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. If I can sneak one more in, your two larger competitors in US are obviously merging with European counterparts. Historically, industry has had mixed track-record being international. But Mark, Tom, team, I'm just curious, how do you kind of see that perhaps changing the competitive landscape and how you may compete and how you proceed with some of your customers going forward?\nMark Kowlzan: I don't even think about it as a significant change here in the domestic marketplace. This is a -- they're doing it for their own reasons. But again Tom, you want to comment on that?\nTom Hassfurther: I don't have any comment at all, that relative to our competitors or what they're attempting to do or trying to do. We know what we need to do in our marketplace and that's what we go and focus on executing.\nMark Kowlzan: Just keep in mind for better part of 30 years, we concentrated in the lower 48 states and we've grown our business significantly over these last few decades here in the United States, and we'll continue to do so. And we've outgrown the rest of the industry by doing that and we'll continue to do that.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from George Staphos from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead with your follow-up.\nGeorge Staphos: Hi, thanks for taking the follow on. Recognizing that for years, Packaging Corp has hired its team of engineers and has focused on productivity both at the mill level and the box plant level. And you said, Mark, earlier that the projects and the programs will continue to add infinitum. Is there any fade in terms of the net benefit we should expect to Packaging Corp's P&L over time from these programs? Recognize they're going to continue, you know, basically, has a lot of lower hanging fruit been consumed or do you think you can continue with -- I think you said last quarter, you're spending $150 million in the box plants this year. Obviously, we'll get an update in June or July that you can continue to have that same rate of return on these programs and we can continue to see that benefit to the P&L as we've been seeing over the last couple of years. Thank you.\nMark Kowlzan: That will never end. If a company does not have the capability that we do, you will not be able to function efficiently going forward. The technology capability that we bring to bear 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we take care of our operational matters in real-time, whether it's a box plant issue or a mill issue, we don't depend on vendors to take care of our needs. And so this technology, the engineering group is not only working on capital investments, but they're working on process efficiency, process improvement on a real-time 24/7 basis, and that will never end. And that's been one of the benefits that has differentiated PCA for many years now, and we just continue to make it better and better. And the opportunities that the organization, whether you take an individual box plant or a mill and you take the operating group and the technology engineering group together, they see new opportunities continuously. And then you're able to identify new technology that can be applied and then we implement that new technology and again, how that rolls into the relationship with growing what our customer needs are.\nGeorge Staphos: So, Mark, recognizing you can't give us a schedule in terms of benefit this quarter, next quarter, next year, three years from now, in your mind's eye, you see as the efforts will continue, as you just said, the return and the benefit to the P&L should be roughly what we've been seeing in the last few years on a going-forward basis at PCA. Would that be right?\nMark Kowlzan: Absolutely. It's -- that's one of the differentiating factors that will continue to provide the type of benefits that you see at PCA.\nGeorge Staphos: Thanks, Mark.\nMark Kowlzan: Thanks, George. Any further questions?\nOperator: And we do have an additional question from Ryan Fox from Bloomberg. Please go ahead with your question.\nRyan Fox: Good morning, gentlemen. In the fourth quarter of '23, we saw that you outperformed the broader industry by a very wide margin. Just curious if you felt like in the first quarter, we're going to see a similar performance.\nMark Kowlzan: Well, again, we just -- we just reported that in our second quarter. Tom had called out the fact that our trend continues into the second quarter. So, Bob, go ahead.\nBob Mundy: No, I mean, Tom, he's referring to the industry numbers. I think that will come out at the end of the week versus our performance.\nTom Hassfurther: Right. I think we'll outperform the industry, but I would think that the industry will be up as well.\nRyan Fox: And why do you think you've outperformed the industry by such a great margin in the last two quarters?\nTom Hassfurther: Well, one reason is that we've been very, very focused on, as I said, our existing customers. Our CapEx has been around those existing customers. And some of those customers, as I indicated in the past, coming out of COVID, we had a large customer base that had really gone through some very significant destocking of inventory and they were kind of slow to recover. And they have now recovered at a very rapid rate. And so that's been very helpful to us because if you look at our -- it's no secret, I mean, we had a pretty easy comp you know a year ago. And we're -- so the number looks very, very good. But as you look at last year, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter of '23, all improved and kept improving. And so in order to keep up this pace, we're going to have to keep improving throughout the year, which we seek happening. But, it's a whole myriad of things, but also we've got some real lift from a couple of significant customers that had really lagged coming out of COVID.\nRyan Fox: Brilliant. Thank you so much.\nMark Kowlzan: Thank you. Any further questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And sir, at this time in showing no additional questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you, Mr. Kowlzan, for any closing comments.\nMark Kowlzan: I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today and look forward to talking with you later at the end of July to give you the second quarter results and spend some time with you then. Have a good day. Take care. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does complete today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Tom Hassfurther",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark. As Mark mentioned, Packaging segment volume for the quarter exceeded our guidance estimates. Corrugated product shipments per workday were up 11% and total shipments with one less shipping day were up 9.2% compared to last year's first quarter. Compared to the pre-COVID period of the first quarter of 2019, shipments were up over 10.4% on a per day basis. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 40,000 tons above last year's first quarter and 15,000 tons below the fourth quarter of 2023. Our order backlog remained incredibly strong throughout the quarter, and although demand continues to be challenged by constant inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, we expect to continue this positive momentum as we enter the second quarter. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together moved slightly higher from the fourth quarter of 2023 levels by $0.01 per share, which was less than we anticipated due to our total announced increase not being recognized in the published benchmark prices. Versus the first quarter of 2023, prices and mix were down $1.19 per share. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.01 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and down $0.14 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. I'd like to point out that the capital spending and optimization strategy within our box plant system that we have been continuously focused on over the last few years is providing incredible benefits. This has allowed us to focus on the mix of customers we want to profitably grow our revenues with by providing them the product and service needs they desire and allows them to grow. Based on our current demand outlook for this year, this strategy has us on pace to set a new record for box shipments per plant. I'll now turn it back to Mark. George, this is Tom. Yeah, bookings remain very strong, as I indicated in the -- in the call earlier in the script, were up 8% as of now. And we can -- we expect a strong second quarter and the remainder of the year as well. Right. Are you asking about mix of export or you ask -- what exactly you're asking, George? Let me see if I can tie this together here real quick for you, George. Number one is the export. The export in first quarter versus fourth quarter, as I indicated was down slightly. Fourth quarter is a big export time for us. And -- but on an overall basis, it was pretty flat. Relative to the EBITDA margins, I think one of the things that probably you might be missing in the model was the fact that the $20 downturn that took place last year, some of that bled into the first of the year because of contract triggers. And of course, we were counting on the $70 being published and the only $40 was published and it was slightly delayed. So the roll through in the price increase did not occur quite as quickly as we had hoped and not in the same amount because of the index. In addition to that, I just want to remind you that inflation remains very sticky. And I think there is a lot of noise around inflation, the rate of inflation having slowed from that rapid rate during COVID, but it's still going up. And it's been going up, at the same time, the index has indicated prices going in the opposite direction until this $40 increase. So I think that's -- I think that's where the -- where the margin gap is. Well, I think I would add -- I think it's a good reminder always that our capital plants and the box plants are built around our customers. And our customers that we're aligned with are in growth mode and that's a big benefit to us. And we'll continue to invest around those customers. Gabe, this is Tom. That's a great question you have, especially relative to the decoupling from RISI. As I indicated in our last call, this would not be an easy task and it's going to take some time. But we're still pressing forward with that, driven again by our customers' frustration over what is going on and what gets reported these days. If you just work through at least from PCA's perspective, if you look through the -- walk through the math and you said, well, liner came down $110 after its peak and medium a little bit more, we would need to have a significant recovery to get back to those kind of levels. And as I also indicated, inflation continues to take place. So there's a -- even customers have said to us that if things had just remained the same from the peak, they would have -- they'd almost prefer that just because they just don't like these roller-coaster rides, and they're trying to get off of that down and then up and then down and then up, and these sorts of things. So -- and over a long period of time, we could have managed that in a much smoother fashion. So these are the kind of discussions we're having with our customers. Our customers are very open to alternatives and different methods. But you got to remember, a lot of these contracts are long-term contracts.

And costs in general and some costs that we're trying to minimize as much as we possibly can, but in lots of cases, we can't. So hopefully that gives you the -- hopefully that gives you a good indication of where we are. I think in total spendm Gabe, it's like 65% or so is rail, I believe. I think it's a... Anthony, I think it's a fair question, but far more complicated than I think you have in a lot of other materials. And I'd also like to add that in containerboard, not every sheet is the same. And you have a lot of variance between everything between 100% virgin and 100% recycled and a lot of technology in between there on performance liners, et cetera. So there's just a whole myriad of things that go into the process that would have to be taken into account. And it's not as simple as just taking that raw fiber or something like that as your single material. Anthony, this is Tom again.

And they have now recovered at a very rapid rate. And so that's been very helpful to us because if you look at our -- it's no secret, I mean, we had a pretty easy comp you know a year ago. And we're -- so the number looks very, very good. But as you look at last year, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter of '23, all improved and kept improving. And so in order to keep up this pace, we're going to have to keep improving throughout the year, which we seek happening. But, it's a whole myriad of things, but also we've got some real lift from a couple of significant customers that had really lagged coming out of COVID."

            "name": "Mark Kowlzan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's first quarter 2024 earnings release conference call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of Packaging Corporation of America. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President who runs the Packaging business, and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our first quarter results, and then I'll be turning it over to Tom and Bob, who will provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $147 million or $1.63 per share. Excluding special items, first quarter 2024 net income was $155 million or $1.72 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023's net income of $198 million or $2.20 per share. Our first quarter net sales were $2 billion in 2024 and 2023. Total company EBITDA for the first quarter, excluding special items, was $333 million in 2024 and $405 million in 2023. First quarter net income included special items expenses of $0.09 per share, primarily for certain costs at our Jackson, Alabama mill for the paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. Details of special items for both the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release. Excluding the special items, the $0.48 per share decrease in first quarter 2024 earnings compared to the first quarter of 2023 was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in the Packaging segment for $1.33, and Paper segment $0.08, higher scheduled mill outage expense $0.10, higher depreciation $0.03, higher expenses related to corrugated plant capital projects of $0.02 and other expenses $0.04. These items were partially offset by higher volumes in the Packaging segment for $0.71, and Paper segment $0.06. We also had lower operating and converting costs of $0.15 driven by very good process efficiencies and control over other usages of fiber, chemicals, energy, materials and labor. Although energy prices were lower versus last year's first quarter, they were more than offset by higher recycled fiber prices. In addition, we had lower freight and logistics expenses for $0.04, lower interest expense $0.07 and lower tax rate $0.09. The results were $0.18 above the first quarter guidance of $1.54 per share, primarily due to the strong volume in both the Packaging and Paper segments, along with the continued emphasis on cost management and process efficiencies across our manufacturing and converting facilities. This drove operating and converting costs lower even with the persistent inflation we continue to experience across most of the cost structure. Executing the conversion outage at our Jackson, Alabama mill better than planned resulted in lower scheduled mill maintenance outages, expenses and freight and logistics expenses were less than guidance as well. Looking at the Packaging business, EBITDA, excluding special items in the first quarter of 2024 of $326 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 18.1% versus last year's EBITDA of $392 million or sales of $1.8 billion or 21.7% margin. Throughout the quarter, containerboard and corrugated products demand exceeded our expectations. In addition to outstanding operational performance at our box plants and containerboard mills, we were able to service the high demand from excellent execution of the convert -- of the conversion outage at our Jackson mill. This enabled us to restart both machines earlier than anticipated and we completed our work prior to the quarter-end rather than in the month of April, which had been the original plan. Despite these efforts, with the higher demand, we ended the quarter at a record-low weeks of inventory supply for this time of year. With just our Filer, Michigan mill having a scheduled maintenance outage in the second quarter, we do expect to build our inventories back to targeted levels by the end of this quarter. I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business in general. Thanks, Tom. Looking at the Paper segment, EBITDA excluding special items in the first quarter was $41 million with sales of $164 million or 25% margin compared to the first quarter of 2023's EBITDA of $41 million and sales of $151 million or 27% margin. Sales volume, which exceeded our guidance estimates, was 14% above the fourth quarter of 2023 and 16% above the first quarter of 2023. Demand was very good both from our existing customers as well as incremental volume from some new customers as we acquire -- that we acquired towards the end of 2023. Orders remain strong as we enter the second quarter, although volume will be impacted by the scheduled maintenance outage at our International Falls, Minnesota mill in June. An improved sales mix moved paper prices slightly above the fourth quarter of 2023, although prices and mix were down about 6% from last year's first quarter. This past February, we announced $100 price increase across all of our paper grades and we began implementing these increases on April 1. I'll now turn it over to Bob. Thanks, Bob. Looking ahead, as we move from the first and into the second quarter in our Packaging segment, we expect continued strong demand and higher corrugated products and containerboard shipments. Prices and mix will move higher due to our announced price increases and increase in published domestic index prices as well as higher export prices. Orders in our Paper segment are expected to remain strong, however volumes will be lower due to the scheduled maintenance outage at the International Falls Minnesota mill during the quarter. Although we're implementing our recently announced paper price increases, the average prices and mix are expected to be slightly lower due to the published decrease in index prices earlier this year and how that impacts contract triggers with certain customers. Operating and converting costs should be slightly lower, primarily due to the sequential improvement in seasonal weather and wage and benefit timing expenses that we incurred in the first quarter and scheduled maintenance outage expenses will be lower. Rail rate increases at six of our mills during the first and second quarters will result in higher freight and logistics expenses and depreciation expense will be higher. Finally, our tax rate will be sequentially higher due to the tax-related benefit of share-based compensation vests in the first quarter. Considering these items, we expect the second quarter earnings of $2.07 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constitute the forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations, and projections of the company and do involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open up the call for questions, please. Bob? Thanks, Bob. Yeah, Tom, do you want to comment about mix and... George, there's a lot of elements within the cost structure that people lose sight of. I mean, if you keep in mind, I mean things just like general services that a paper mill or box plant relies on, all these associated costs to run the business are up dramatically over the last few years and they're not easing up. Bob, do you want to comment on this? Again, I think people are truly, truly missing that. Thank you. Next question, please. I can tell you, the demand improved across the board, believe it or not. When we look at the various segments, whether it's e-com, ag, food, even in the heavier manufacturing area, we had significant improvement across the board. We've got this momentum going right now that we started good five or six years ago. And quite frankly, as we've done on the mill side now, the opportunity to continue to capitalize on the box plant opportunity will continue infinitum for us. That's part of our growth strategy. That's how we'll continue to provide value for our customer base. And so again, Tom, again just... Again, I think I commented on the January call in the last five years since 2019, we've installed 69 new converting machines. We've replaced or completely upgraded 25 of our corrugators. We built four new plants, Marshfield, Richland, Landisville and Salt Lake City specialty. In Salt Lake City, we just started up in the last month, so that's our newest one. And so we continue to do this as Tom mentioned, it's all done to grow with the customer and take care of what the customer needs are. But we have this capability and it's -- again, we'll continue to capitalize on the strength. Next question, please. Yes, everything that we had sculped out four years ago is complete, and that project has turned out, as you can imagine, we're more pleased than we thought we were going to be at this time. The original phase of work that we just completed was originally a 58-day schedule. We completed that two weeks ahead of time, started up the day before Easter, and have been running extremely well ever since. And as I've talked over the last year, I expected that machine to be producing over 2,000 tons a day and we've been doing that for the last week or two. And so, getting that mill stretched out now, and getting everybody used to running at these high production rates, but the good news is we need every ton that we can produce. And this is all high-performance grade lightweight linerboard coming off that machine. And so it's doing everything that we expected it to do and more. If you include the seven mill system, would be a little bit over 5 million tons. If you round off 5 million tons system, a little over 5 million tons, 5.2 million or so. Depending on the grade mix that you're running as far as lightweights basis weight, 5 million, 5.2 million is a good number going forward on a run rate basis. Mark, it's still going up, it's going up at a lesser rate, but still we're going up and -- but second quarter is always an interesting one for us versus the third and fourth, which are more predictable because we have -- we take -- seasonality is kind of a little more iffy in the second quarter. But we still see that momentum going up and then we expect it to continue to go up again in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Yeah, Mark, that was a timing issue as far as just how the invoicing is done against the projects. We called out that somewhere in that higher 400 level, and we'll give you some updates in July. We always reserve the right as an example, if new opportunities come along, we move forward with these opportunities. And so right now, we're in that high $400 million area. But again, we'll give you some update. If there's any -- if there is any change, we'll update you in July. Good morning. Yeah, I don't have any comment regarding that. That's at some place it's -- I won't go. But as you can imagine, we take advantage of opportunities as they come along. Next question, please. Good morning. Yeah, Anthony, I think it played -- we did a little bit better, I think on what the impact was in 1Q. But in our 2Q guidance, what I indicated, I think like you said, I think it was 60% of those seasonal or one-time items on the wage side of cost. We are seeing those in our guidance for the second quarter. Yeah, Tom, go ahead... Yeah, I just wanted to emphasize that maybe once upon a time, when a decade ago, things were more stable in general with inflationary activity and fiber would move up and down and -- but now the last number of years, we're in a world where inflation is back on track at the way it was decades ago and you're seeing across-the-board all your input costs up dramatically. And as Tom said, it would be too complex to try to tie that into some type of mechanism. But don't forget again just like 25 years ago, transportation was a very minimal cost factor in moving containerboard and paper products around the country. Now transportation factor is in as a major -- very significant major element to the cost, just that one component. Yeah, suffice it to say, we'll be far better off going forward. Thank you. Next question, please. If you went back over the last five years, if you think about labor input cost and labor unit applied per square foot of product or ton of product, we've significantly improved the productivity and cost structure of every one of these converting facilities and full-line box plants. We're producing -- we quadrupled in many cases, doubled the productivity on average out of a box plant. And so it's given us incredible flexibility on how we grow with these customers and the capability to service these customers and do it in a very efficient manner. And that's where, again, we're able now to continue that momentum and we're not playing catch-up. We're in very good -- all of our box plants, our paper mills were in very good position as far as our cost structure and efficiencies to compete. And so we just lay in the new investments that, as Tom has said, we grow with the customer. And so again, but we've been doing this for decades. There's nothing that we just came up with the idea five years ago, we're going to do this. We've been working at this for a couple of decades and we've been fine-tuning this and making it better. And it's just in the last five years, we focused heavily within the box plant system with this organizational change we made in 2019. Relative to the box price increase, it's going to flow through as normal over a 90-day period. We'll have a little bit of -- we'll have a little bit of lag into the midyear because we do have some contracts that have triggers in the midyear. But the lion's share of it as usual will roll in over 90-day period. We are not -- I'm not going to discuss what we do individually with our customers or anything like that, but we did put the $70 price increase through and on containerboard, as I indicated last time, and that's been done for quite some time. And that's basically what we expect now. Relative to an independent or whatever talking about supply-demand or whatever the case might be, I mean, that's part of the whole frustration of the model that exists right now because as I've indicated many times, the open market is incredibly small today. And when I hear things about 70% of the surveyed -- of the survey says X or Y, that's 70% of what, 1% or something. I don't know what the -- how those percentages work out, and there's no indication of that. So that's why we've, as I indicated last time some of the need to have some consideration for perhaps some other mechanisms. I don't even think about it as a significant change here in the domestic marketplace. This is a -- they're doing it for their own reasons. But again Tom, you want to comment on that? Just keep in mind for better part of 30 years, we concentrated in the lower 48 states and we've grown our business significantly over these last few decades here in the United States, and we'll continue to do so. And we've outgrown the rest of the industry by doing that and we'll continue to do that. Next question. That will never end. If a company does not have the capability that we do, you will not be able to function efficiently going forward. The technology capability that we bring to bear 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we take care of our operational matters in real-time, whether it's a box plant issue or a mill issue, we don't depend on vendors to take care of our needs. And so this technology, the engineering group is not only working on capital investments, but they're working on process efficiency, process improvement on a real-time 24/7 basis, and that will never end. And that's been one of the benefits that has differentiated PCA for many years now, and we just continue to make it better and better. And the opportunities that the organization, whether you take an individual box plant or a mill and you take the operating group and the technology engineering group together, they see new opportunities continuously. And then you're able to identify new technology that can be applied and then we implement that new technology and again, how that rolls into the relationship with growing what our customer needs are. Absolutely. It's -- that's one of the differentiating factors that will continue to provide the type of benefits that you see at PCA. Thanks, George. Any further questions? Well, again, we just -- we just reported that in our second quarter. Tom had called out the fact that our trend continues into the second quarter. So, Bob, go ahead. Thank you. Any further questions? I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today and look forward to talking with you later at the end of July to give you the second quarter results and spend some time with you then. Have a good day. Take care. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $260 million and free cash flow was a first quarter record $184 million. The primary payments of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $77 million and dividend payments of $112 million. Excluding the invested cash proceeds from the bond transaction we mentioned on last quarter's call, our quarter-end cash balance, including marketable securities was approximately $900 million with liquidity of $1.2 billion. Due to the excellent execution of the conversion outage at the Jackson mill that Mark spoke of and moving the International Falls mill outage from the third quarter and into the second quarter, we are revising the scheduled mill outage guidance we provided on last quarter's call. The revised total company estimated cost impact for the year is now $0.89 per share versus $0.96 per share previously. The actual impact in the first quarter was $0.24 per share and the revised estimated impact by quarter for the remainder of the year is now $0.18 per share in the second quarter, $0.14 in the third, and $0.33 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark. Yeah, yeah, I don't have the absolute -- yeah, the integration in the first quarter was around 90%, almost 93%, George. And slightly below that, I think it was in the fourth quarter. Yeah. Yeah, Mark. I mean the things and even as we go into the second quarter from the first, obviously, recycled fiber, wood may be a little bit higher from a price standpoint, electrical rate, even though gas is down, electrical rates are not. Chemicals, whether it be lime, adhesives in the box plants, resins, alums, starch across the board, all moving higher. And again, we typically talk about all the direct type of costs and which is only about 40% of our cost base, you have the other 60% which are, as Mark referenced, there are maintenance services, repairs, materials, operating material supplies, property taxes, rent, warehouse cost, insurance leases. So it's -- there is constant inflation and all the people that supply those things, they have the same inflation going on in their business and they don't eat it. They pass it on to us. So a lot of that just gets overlooked, I think, George. No, I mean, Tom, he's referring to the industry numbers. I think that will come out at the end of the week versus our performance."
